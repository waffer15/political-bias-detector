","This is my mother. She died of a glioblastoma – the same brain tumor Senator John McCain was just diagnosed with – on January 10, 2015. It was almost six months after they found and removed *most of it. This picture was taken right after that operation.
Although my mom had the same diagnosis as McCain there is one very important difference between them. She didn’t have insurance and, because she lived in Florida, she didn’t have Medicaid either.
She had fallen on hard times – actually, she perpetually lived in hard times because of mental health issues – so she worked at a laundromat and made enough to be self-sufficient. Self-sufficiency wasn’t necessarily something she was good at but she was doing okay at it at the time. That was what my brother told me, at least; I hadn’t talked to her in two years.
My brother is the one who forced her to go to the emergency room. She hadn’t been making sense for a couple months, according to him. But on that day he found her babbling on the floor in her hot efficiency – the AC was broken and it was summer in South Florida.
It was at the hospital that they found it – this deadly brain tumor that steals away your life, your soul, you in a blink of an eye. My brother called and told me what was going on; I threw on my “let’s fix it” emotional armor and headed to the hospital. From that point on I was her caretaker and I had no idea what to do.
“This is my mother’s glioblastoma story. Senator McCain’s story will be vastly different because he has health insurance.”
What now?
The belief that having access to emergency room services counts as having access to health care doesn’t pass muster. After the emergency is over, then what? What are you supposed to do?
Just like John McCain, my mother had the glioblastoma removed and was prescribed radiation and chemotherapy. But, she didn’t have insurance so she could not follow through with the treatment.
No one bothered (not even the hospital social worker) to give me important information like having a glioblastoma is one of 88 diseases that automatically qualifies you for Medicaid. I had to figure that out for myself. It took me almost three months to get her approved.
Unfortunately, before those three months had passed, she had had another emergency hospital visit due to inflammation in her brain. The steroids they put her on made her gain a ton of weight and she didn’t look like herself. I imagine this was hard on her; she always cared about her looks and connected it somewhat to her sense of self-worth. The energy and hope that she had right after her craniotomy was gone and she was losing her mind.
Too late
My mother was lucky enough to be accepted into a clinical trial program at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. It is showing promising results and surprisingly Medicaid approved it. But she wouldn’t go. I couldn’t even get her to go to the radiation oncologist.
I can’t tell you how many appointments I had to cancel. Every day I would say, “You are going today.” Every day there was a different reason why she couldn’t go but the real reason that she wouldn’t go was that she was scared. She thought they were killing her. She thought I was trying to kill her.
The paranoia grew and much of the time it was directed at me. It was episodic at first, but towards the end became much more frequent. I should have been more tolerant at the time. When I think about it now, I can’t imagine being that scared.
I hope that Senator McCain’s last days are not like that; I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.
“I hope that Senator McCain’s last days are not like this; I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.”
Dying in peace
Those months would have been different if she had had health insurance. I would have known what to do, and if I didn’t, I would have known who to call to ask. Who knows, if she had insurance maybe she would have gone to the doctor a lot sooner rather than ending up in the emergency room.
I realize that in all probability she still would not have had that long to live. But, perhaps what time she did have would have been longer, would have been easier, would have been more pleasant for her. Maybe she would have been able to appreciate her grandchildren. Maybe – just maybe – she wouldn’t have been so frightened.
In the end, it was actually Medicaid that allowed her to die in peace. I was able to put her in hospice because of Medicaid. As hard as it was to see her sleeping 24 hours a day from medication, it was better than her being conscious while going completely crazy.
Not having insurance quickened my mother’s death and having Medicaid made it easier for her to die.
That is my mother’s glioblastoma story. Senator John McCain’s glioblastoma story will be vastly different because he has health insurance. And, don’t get me wrong, I am so happy he does. I am happy for him and for his family.
It has been three years since her diagnosis, two and a half years since her death. I have [surprisingly] become an activist protesting legislation that will take health care from millions of people put forth by John McCain’s own party.
With only 12,000 people diagnosed with the tumor a year, not many people understand what the senator is up against. I do. Perhaps there is a reason for that; perhaps I am meant to tell this story.
Health care is a right, not a privilege. Dying of cancer gracefully should be a right, not a privilege.
John McCain has been in Congress a long time and he is one of the most respected legislators in D.C. He has the power to protect people from having the same experience as my mother, I just hope he uses it."
progressive,"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/29/facebook-posts/are-97-nations-100-poorest-counties-red-states/
","A meme circulating on Twitter and other social media recently caught our eye. Created by the liberal group Occupy Democrats , it said, ""97 percent of the 100 poorest counties in America are in red states. But tell me again how Republican policies grow the economy?""
This was a variation on a few memes we’ve checked previously -- that nine out of the 10 poorest states are red states (we rated this Mostly True ) and that Republican-leaning states get more in federal dollars than they pay in taxes (also Mostly True ).
While the meme’s suggestion that ""Republican policies"" are causing poverty is too subjective a question to be fact-checked, we decided to take a closer look at the set-up to the claim -- that ""97 percent of the 100 poorest counties in America are in red states.""
First, we’ll explain our methodology.
To determine the nation’s 100 poorest counties, we downloaded data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. This data covers five years ending in 2012, and includes more than 3,000 counties and county equivalents (such as Louisiana parishes). This data enabled us to rank-order these jurisdictions based on two commonly used measurements -- median income, and percentage of the population in poverty.
As for determining whether a state is ""red"" or ""blue,"" we decided to define it by whether the state voted for President Barack Obama or Mitt Romney in 2012. This means we counted North Carolina and Indiana as red states, since Obama lost them in 2012 after winning them in 2008. (Though either way, the differences would have been marginal.)
So how did the data turn out?
For median income, we found that 95 of the 100 poorest counties were located in red states. Here are the 10 poorest, all of them in red states:
1. Owsley County, Ky.
2. Jefferson County, Miss.
3. Wolfe County, Ky.
4. Brooks County, Texas
5. McCreary County, Ky.
6. Hudspeth County, Texas
7. Hancock County, Tenn.
8. Jackson County, Ky.
9. Clay County, Ky.
10. Holmes County, Miss.
For percentage of residents in poverty, we found that 93 of the 100 poorest counties were in red states.
Here are the 10 with the highest poverty rates, all of them in red states:
1. Shannon County, S.D.
2. Clay County, Ga.
3. East Carroll Parish, La.
4. Sioux County, N.D.
5. Todd County, S.D.
6. Hudspeth County, Texas
7. Holmes County, Miss.
8. Corson County, S.D.
9. Wolfe County, Ky.
10. Humphreys County, Miss.
So there are some differences between the most recent Census data and what the meme said, but they are pretty small. Numerically, we don’t have much to quibble with.
Our bigger question concerns whether it’s significant that a lot of poor counties are located in red states. There’s reason for at least a bit of skepticism.
For starters, the list is dominated by rural areas. Generally speaking, rural areas have a lower cost of living, so the small income you make in a poor, rural Texas county is going to go further than it would if you lived in a poor, urban area like Detroit or Camden, N.J. This raises questions about how comparatively disadvantaged poor Americans are in rural and urban areas.
Also, rural areas are areas where Republicans tend to do well electorally. By contrast, impoverished areas of big cities are big enough population-wise to be balanced by more affluent neighborhoods, and these poor urban areas are often (though not always) in blue states.
It’s also worth pointing out that many of the counties on the list are located in Appalachia, particularly in such states as Kentucky, West Virginia, Mississippi and Georgia. That’s a region that has suffered economically for generations -- long predating the time when Republicans took over from Democrats in most elected offices.
In Appalachia, ""it’s clear there’s a regional problem, born of isolation, geographic and political; exploitation, of timber and coal; and poor education,"" said Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky.
Finally, there’s an eccentricity that shaped both of the top-100 lists. Each is dominated by three states: Texas, Georgia and Kentucky. What ties together these three states? They have a lot of counties. In fact, these three states rank first, second and third on the list of states that have the most counties . Texas has 254, Georgia 159 and Kentucky 120.
This means that these three states have lots of rural, small-population counties, so they take up a disproportionate share of the spots on these lists. On each list, these three states collectively account for more than 40 percent of the counties listed.
Importantly, each of these three states are red states. If some of the bigger blue states had been sliced into as many counties as Texas, Georgia and Kentucky were, some of those blue-state counties might have been poor and rural, and that could have changed the complexion of the list. As it is, blue states tend to have smaller numbers of counties. New York has 62, California has 57, Washington state has 39, Oregon has 36, New Jersey has 21 and Massachusetts has just 14.
Our ruling
The meme said that ""97 percent of the 100 poorest counties in America are in red states."" According to the most recent data, that’s a few percentage points high, but not by much.
However, measuring a county’s lack of affluence this way skews the map of poorest places toward rural states (which tend to be red) and away from big cities (which tend to be blue). This undercuts the simplicity of the meme’s political message.
The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True."

","It happened. Trump just became the president-elect of the United States, despite the damning audio 2005 recording of him bragging to TV host Billy Bush about sexually assaulting women with impunity.
Trump bragged to Bush that “when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.”
“You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful [women],” Trump also said. “I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait.”
And for a moment, Trump’s gut-churning, boastful admission that he forces himself on women threatened to derail his campaign. Never mind that at that point he had already attacked a Gold Star Family, made racist comments about a judge with Mexican heritage and was responsible for, well... a lot of other abhorrent behavior.
And yet, it was only Bush who was ultimately held accountable for his role in the vulgar conversation. The TV host had since moved on from “Access Hollywood” to NBC’s major money-maker, the “Today” show ― and it took the network a mere 10 days to boot him from the program.
“Let me be clear ― there is simply no excuse for Billy’s language and behavior on that tape,” a memo from the show’s executive producer Noah Oppenheim read, released just after Bush was initially suspended from his job.
Comedian Chelsea Handler was among those who have noted that Bush’s firing and Trump’s ascent to the Oval Office is evidence that media personalities are held to a higher standard than someone running for president."

","This is wrong.
Whichever way President Trump tries to justify his executive order on banning immigrants and refugees from seven war-ravaged countries, it makes no sense.
The facts, alternate or otherwise, speak for themselves:
Nobody from any of those predominantly Muslim countries – Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen - has committed a terror attack on US mainland.
The perpetrators of the two major Islamic extremist terror attacks in New York on 9/11 and more recently in San Bernadino, came from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Lebanon and Pakistan.
Yet, perversely, none of these countries are on the banned list.
Whichever way President Trump (pictured signing an order on Friday) tries to justify his executive order on banning immigrants and refugees from seven war-ravaged countries, it makes no sense
As always with the often absurdly exaggerated anti-Trump hysteria that greets everything he does, it’s important to offer some clarification and perspective.
Trump’s not throwing all Muslims out of America, nor is he banning all Muslims from coming in as he once, shockingly, threatened to do.
He’s putting a temporary ban on any people from seven countries where Islamic terror is rife, until much tighter VISA systems and ‘extreme vetting’ is put in place.
This is exactly what he repeatedly said he’d do in the latter stages of his campaign, it’s therefore one of the reasons he won the election, and it will be applauded by many millions of Americans who voted for him.
I also genuinely believe Donald Trump is doing this because he wants to stop Americans being attacked again by Islamic extremists, not because he just hates Muslims.
He’s seen what’s happened in Paris, Nice and Brussels and blames lax border controls for the ease with which nihilist terrorists can now infiltrate civilian life, some by posing as refugees, and kill mass numbers of people.
There is undeniably a very good argument to further strengthen immigration rules to prevent people with nefarious intent from entering the US.
Indeed, Barack Obama took several significant steps to do just that in the last year.
There is no good reason why people with perfectly valid permanent resident green cards have been rounded up at airports, handcuffed, and threatened with deportation. Pictured: Demonstrators gathered at JFK Airport
So let’s not pretend that everything Donald Trump’s doing here is outrageous and unacceptable just because he’s Donald Trump.
But nor can we pretend that some of what he’s doing is not outrageous and unacceptable – because it is.
There is no good reason why people with perfectly valid permanent resident green cards have been rounded up at airports, handcuffed, and threatened with deportation.
Slashing the number of genuine refugees America will accept going forward, and taking none from Syria ‘indefinitely’, is utterly reprehensible, too.
These people are fleeing the very Middle East battlefields sparked by the illegal, immoral and disastrous war on Iraq.
A war that America, with its equally culpable allies like Britain, started with Saddam Hussein as twisted, illogical revenge for a terror attack committed by somebody else.
The wrong guy was targeted then, just as this executive order picks on many of the wrong guys now.
We have a moral duty to help those innocent people whose lives have been ruined by our unjustified warfare. To now subject them to even more oppression, heartache and despair seems cruel.
The perpetrators of the two major Islamic extremist terror attacks in New York on 9/11 and more recently in San Bernadino (Syed Rizwan Farook, left, and Tashfeen Malik, right), came from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Lebanon and Pakistan
Even worse, it may imperil their lives if they are forced to return to places where they may be killed.
It cannot be right that they are now being victimized for something they haven’t done.
There is also a massive delusion to the myth that Muslim terrorists are the biggest violent threat to American lives.
Since Donald Trump’s inauguration nine days ago, more than 750 people have been killed by guns in America, through murder, accident and suicide.
This is the horrific daily toll on American life from firearms.
Today, another 85 people will be shot dead.
And the same tomorrow.
The situation is so appalling that in 2016, more Americans were killed by TODDLERS with guns than by terrorists.
Yet there has been no executive order to try to stop this carnage, and nor is there likely to be.
President Trump was vociferously backed by the NRA in his election campaign and he is a fervent supporter of the 2nd Amendment.
This raises a massive flaw in the logic of his determination to protect Americans and make the country safer.
It’s also grotesquely unfair because it punishes many decent, law-abiding people who have every right to be in the country. Pictured: Homa Homaei, a US citizen from Iran, is pictured receiving a hug from a lawyer working to help her Iranian family members at Los Angeles International Airport
How can you ban people from countries that have so far committed zero terror attacks on US mainland to ‘keep America safe’, but do nothing about the domestic deadly gun-related terror being waged on the streets every day by Americans of all color and creed?
I am all for President Trump wielding the big stick of American military power when it comes to destroying ISIS.
They are a despicable group of medieval barbarians intent on destroying our way of life.
But this overly-draconian executive order will simply serve to empower ISIS, act as the best recruitment agent they could possibly wish for, and fuel their conspiracy theory that America’s waging war on Islam, not just Islamic terrorists.
It’s also grotesquely unfair because it punishes many decent, law-abiding people who have every right to be in the country.
Olympic Gold medal champion runner Sir Mo Farah has a dual UK/Somali citizenship so is technically now banned from America where he does much of his training.
An Iraqi-born British member of Parliament, Nadhim Zahawi, whose children are at Princeton University, can’t come in.
Hameed Darweesh, a hero US military translator for 10 years, was detained at JFK airport and only freed after mass protests.
As for the indefinite ban on Syrian refugees, consider this: Apple creator Steve Jobs’ father was a Syrian refugee to the US.
Hameed Darweesh (pictured), a hero US military translator for 10 years, was detained at JFK airport and only freed after mass protests
Under this new order, he would have been banned entry, and America’s most successful ever company would never have happened.
How can any of this be right?
‘We don’t want them here,’ President Trump said yesterday, referring to Islamic terrorists. ‘We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.’
Every sensible person would agree with this sentiment.
But a lot of those directly and instantly targeted by this crackdown DO support America and DO love the people deeply.
Hence the furious response.
This executive order is not making America great.
It’s making America hate.
Think again, Mr President."
progressive,"http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/one-year-of-coal-ceo-pay-could-retrain-all-workers-for-solar-industry
","On Monday, presidential candidate Donald Trump called for policies designed to put coal miners and steelworkers back to work. The decline of the U.S. coal industry is largely out of the president’s hands, since it is influenced by global markets and the advent of cheaper energy alternatives. But retraining people in the struggling coal industry is still very much within the president's purview.
There is another way for coal workers to make a living, according to a new study from Michigan Technological University and Oregon State University, published in Energy Economics.
It's in solar.
In states with the most coal jobs, many workers could be retrained for the growing solar PV industry -- some at a cost of just a few thousand dollars. For many coal companies, even those filing for bankruptcy, the cost of retraining all employees would be less than a year’s pay for the CEO.
The study noted that the CEO of Consol Energy earned about $14 million in 2012, more than enough to retrain all of the company’s employees for jobs in the PV industry. Arch Coal, which has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, paid its executives and directors more than $29 million in the year leading up to its bankruptcy filing, according to The Wall Street Journal.
While the study touched on executive compensation, the bulk of the research looked at the state-by-state costs and the options for funding private and public retraining programs.
The cost of retraining approximately 90,000 workers in coal production would range from $180 million in the best-case scenario to more than $1.8 billion in the worst-case scenario.
The highest cost would be in West Virginia, which has the largest number of coal workers. The study found the average cost of a retraining program for a coal company would equate to about 5 percent of revenue. Additionally, the study noted that the externalities of the coal industry, such as public health costs, are far higher than any cost incurred to move people to cleaner energy jobs.
In the best-case scenario, the employees whose roles aren’t specific to the coal industry, such as secretaries and electricians, can find jobs in other industries, while the worst-case scenario assumes every employee currently in the coal industry would need to be relocated.
Of course, not every single coal job would have to be recreated in another industry. Many coal-fired power plants will continue to operate for decades in the U.S., and there is still an international market (albeit a shrinking one) for coal.
There are already more solar jobs than coal jobs, and the growth of the solar industry could absorb many coal workers in the next 15 years, according to the researchers.
“The writing on the wall for the coal industry is clear,” wrote Joshua Pearce, a study co-author and associate professor of materials science and engineering at Michigan Technological University, in Harvard Business Review. “Young coal workers, in particular, should consider retraining for a job in solar now.”
The recommendations come with significant caveats, however.
Local governments would have to acknowledge and accept the demise of an industry that they have long supported.
Leading coal states such as West Virginia and Kentucky do not rank in the top 35 solar states, according to GTM Research. Many industry employees would have to relocate unless the local solar market improved substantially.
Training would need to begin sooner rather than later. Some retraining and certification may take as little as three months, but other solar-specific training would require new degrees that could take up to four years to complete. The upside is that many of the jobs in the solar industry offer compensation similar to their counterparts in the coal industry, which has provided some of the best-paying jobs in the regions where they are located.
But solar is not the only other clean energy industry that could provide a safety net for coal workers. Wind markets in states like West Virginia and Wyoming are much more robust than solar.
Bringing clean energy jobs to the rural regions that support thousands of coal workers would take a concerted effort from both state and local governments. For example, some of the resources already available from the federal government can take up to a year to get to miners awaiting retraining, according to Pennsylvania’s PublicSource.
Hillary Clinton has proposed a broad range of measures to bring clean energy jobs, including solar, wind and hydro, to coal country. Any additional efforts at the federal level would need to begin within months, not years.
But given that there are similarities across many energy industries, some coal workers say they would welcome the opportunity to shift to clean energy.
“If they’re going to use energy alternatives, why can’t they bring a solar panel plant here, or train us...to install them in the field? Coal miners are some of the most versatile people here on the planet,"" former Emerald coal miner Bob Wilson told PublicSource in a June story about the future of Pennsylvania’s coal miners. ""We’ve all run equipment, done welding, fabricating. We’ve built million-dollar belt drives from the ground up. We can do this stuff with a little bit of help.”"

","First point: There's considerable evidence that millions more Americans support Bernie Sanders (which means, of course, that even more support Hillary Clinton) than support Trump. How can this be? Look at the early polling numbers. Right now, Trump's national level of support -- according to the average compiled by Real Clear Politics -- is 30.4 percent of GOP primary voters, while Sanders, sitting in second place among national Democrats, has a level of support of 30.8 percent. But then remember this: There are more Democrats (32 percent of Americans, according to Pew) than Republicans (23 percent). Which backs out up the first point: That Sanders has millions more supporting him than does Trump."
progressive,"http://inthesetimes.com/article/18445/bernie-sanders-pushing-hillary-clinton-left
","When Bernie Sanders’ Senior Advisor Tad Devine announced in August that the Democratic presidential candidate would not be running any attack ads against Hillary Clinton, many saw the move as simply being consistent with his previous campaign strategies and his progressive platform. Sanders has said he ​“hates and detests these 30-second negative ads” and has never run one. He sees the ads as part of what’s broken with American politics, and his disavowal of them fits with his electoral reform policies, which condemn super PACs and the buying and sensationalizing of U.S. elections.
If Clinton ran an attack ad, she risked coming off as desperate or a bully. But by not running attack ads, she would essentially render herself unable to combat any surge in the polls by Sanders.
But Sanders’ refusal to produce attack ads has proven to be more than a matter of simple moral consistency. His pledge represented a shrewd political decision by the Sanders campaign — a decision that has now paid off.
Electoral reform is central to Sanders’ platform for president. By swearing off attack ads against his opponents and cash from super PACs which often fund such ads, he has attempted to show that unlike his opponents, he can actually carry out the ideals he speaks so often about. In fact, shortly after Bernie’s announcement, his campaign sent a cease-and-desist letter to a PAC supporting him, which was first formed by Congressional lobbyist Cary Lee Peterson to encourage the Vermont Senator to run.
Meanwhile, Clinton, who earned a reputation for cutting attack ads during her 2008 presidential bid against Obama, is running on a similarly progressive electoral reform platform — while also gladly accepting more than $20 million in support from Priorities USA Action, her Super PAC. At the same time as her own website criticizes the Supreme Court’s Citizen United case, saying it ​“helped unleash hundreds of millions of dollars of secret, unaccountable money into U.S. elections that is drowning out the voices of ordinary Americans and distorting our democracy,” Hillary is seeking some $2 billion , much of it PAC money, for her campaign.
However, the political depth of Bernie’s refusal to run negative attack ads has proven far more important than revealing contrasts between the two candidates. This decision actually forced Hillary’s campaign into an incredibly difficult position. If she ran an attack ad, she risked coming off as desperate or a bully. But by not running attack ads, she would essentially render herself unable to combat any surge in the polls by Sanders.
Until recently, Clinton had held off on running negative publicity. But Sanders’ self-identification as a socialist must have been too hard for her campaign to resist attacking.
On September 14, the Huffington Post received an email from one of Clinton’s Super PACs that intimated Sanders would begin diplomatic ties with terrorists and linked him to the socialist former President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez. In its report on the email, HuffPost concluded it was unclear whether the message would be disseminated to anyone else. If it was, however, ​“the attack would be in the vein of what Sen. Claire McCaskill (D‑Mo.) said about Sanders earlier this year — that he’s unelectable, since he’s a self-identified democratic socialist.”
Sanders’ campaign was quick to react to this attack, sending out an email that illustrated the difference between his political strategy and that of the ​“billionaire class.” ​“Let’s send a powerful message that we have had ENOUGH of the billionaire class buying elections,” the email read. ​“If we stand together to fight back against these ugly attacks, we can ensure this election is about who has the best ideas, and not who has the biggest donors.”
Within two days, the Sanders campaign had raised $1.2 million in grassroots contributions. According to the executive director of ActBlue, the progressive fundraising website Bernie uses to receive online donations, at one point during the blitz, they were receiving 180 contributions per minute.
And on September 20, less than one week after the Super PAC attack first went live, Hillary promised CBS News’ John Dickerson on ​“Face the Nation” that she has ​“no interest” in running attack ads on Bernie. ​“I want this to be about ideas and about policies,” she said. ​“I know Bernie. I respect his enthusiastic and intense advocacy of his ideas. That’s what I want this campaign to be about, and I hope people who support me respect that.”
In fact, this was one of the first times since his announcement that Sanders was explicitly mentioned by Clinton. In the past, she has avoided saying his name and declined to comment on the threat his campaign poses to her success in the primaries.
Sanders’ commitment to refrain from producing attack ads paid off, allowing him to illustrate a vital contrast between himself and Clinton — and raising his campaign more than a million dollars in donations in the process. Furthermore, his consistency forced Clinton to backtrack on an important issue under public scrutiny, reinforcing the notion that she is simply a politician willing to do whatever it takes to win while Sanders operates out of an ironclad commitment his progressive ideals.
Such commitment is a big part of why Sanders’ campaign has proven so refreshing for so many American voters, and for millennials in particular. This generation has largely been disillusioned with U.S. politics: Fewer millennials vote , join political parties or consider politics one of their interests than in previous generations. But Sanders’ campaign has reinvigorated a large proportion of the country’s newest voters: some 59 percent of college-aged Democrats support Sanders, compared to Clinton’s 18 percent, a Chegg Media Center poll reports. Almost half of the students surveyed find Hillary ​“unfavorable.”
Sanders has managed to pull Clinton to the left on yet another issue. As he continues to surge in the polls, Clinton is responding by moving left on issues as diverse as Black Lives Matter, the Keystone XL pipeline, Wall Street and electoral reform and even the Fight for 15. As long as Sanders continues to maintain his progressive stances on a number of other issues, his principled campaigning will likely continue to translate into tangible political gains.
By the end of the primaries, regardless of who wins, the candidate will either be a true progressive dedicated to combatting inequality, fighting systemic racism, and running a clean campaign, or someone forced to champion a number of progressive causes that she likely would have barely considered otherwise. And, unlike Hillary Clinton, that’s what matters to Bernie Sanders — that someone, anyone, gets the job done."

","An Oregon judge says he will bill Ammon Bundy up to $70,000 a day to reimburse Harney County for security costs related to the ongoing occupation of a wildlife refuge.
Local schools reopened Monday for the first time since Bundy and other militants seized a visitors center Jan. 2 at the Malheur National Wildlife Preserve and demanded the transfer of federally owned land to the county, reported KTVZ-TV.
Bundy and other militants used a backhoe owned by the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife to remove fences separating federal land from property owned by a local rancher.
Bundy said the militants had rifled through files at the occupied building looking for evidence of wrongdoing, but he insisted they had not accessed computers -- although public radio reporters witnessed them doing that. WATCH: Teen chokes up at town meeting asking Bundy to leave, says ‘I shouldn’t have to be scared in my own hometown’ Some of the Fish and Wildlife employees have been relocated from their homes ""out of an abundance of caution"" in case their personal information, including home addresses, had been accessed by the militants. They have also changed a sign outside the wildlife refuge to identify the occupied building as the ""Harney County Resource Center,"" although it's not clear how the notoriously cash-strapped militants paid for the new sign.
Sheriff David Ward, who has said he agrees with the militants' views but not their tactics, has set up concrete barriers and other security measures around his office and the courthouse after the militants or their supporters threatened him and other county officials.
Ward issued a statement Monday vowing that he and other law enforcement officials ""will not be intimidated,"" and he repeated his call for the out-of-state militants to leave the area.
""There's an hourglass, and it's running out,"" Ward said as cheers erupted at a public meeting Monday night. ""Go home.""
Harney County Judge Steve Grasty also spoke at the meeting, where he said the occupation had cost taxpayers an estimated $60,000 to $70,000 each day it has dragged on.
""We're going to send Mr. Bundy the bill,"" said Grasty, who criticized Republican lawmakers for meeting with the militants over the weekend. The judge also called on residents not to offer assistance to the roughly two-dozen militants, who have been joined in recent days by out-of-state militia groups. ""No matter how you feel, do not bring food and supplies up to the refuge,"" Grasty said. The militants have been widely mocked for first calling for snacks, and then issuing a wish list of items such as flavored coffee creamer, tampons and cigarettes. They have apparently received some unwanted gifts, such as sex toys, as seen in a Facebook video posted by Jon Ritzheimer, an Arizona veteran who is taking part in the occupation. ""It was really mind-blowing to me that people would actually spend their money (on this),"" Ritzheimer said. ""This box right here, $17.90 (for shipping). They spend and waste their money on all this hateful stuff to send out here to us and buy this ridiculous stuff. This one was really funny -- a 'bag of dicks.' Rather than going out and doing good, they just spend all their money on hate and hate."" He then angrily shoved all the unwanted gifts off a table and onto the floor. Ritzheimer urged fellow ""patriots"" to join them in Oregon for ""history in the making,"" and he offered a message to his family. ""Please look at this as a deployment, only this time I'm actually serving my country rather than being sent over seas to line the pockets of corrupt politicians,"" he said. ""It is our sacrifice as a family that will make this country great again, not some election."""

","President Trump is encouraging his 24 million Twitter followers to ignore accurate polls.
On Monday he tweeted -- inaccurately -- that ""Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election.""
Professional polling is scientific, not political, in nature. Polls by TV networks during the election were not ""fake news."" In fact, most national polls were not far off the mark. The polls correctly showed Hillary Clinton winning the popular vote by a relatively small margin.
But that's about the past. Trump's tweet said more about the future. He was taking his long-standing poll denialism to its illogical conclusion, inviting his supporters to dismiss unpleasant data.
Trump specifically objected to polls that showed opposition to his administration's temporary ban on travel from seven Muslim-majority countries.
""Sorry,"" he wrote, ""people want border security and extreme vetting.""
Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017
If by ""people"" Trump only means the Americans who voted for him, then that's true. But the American public as a whole is starkly divided over the travel ban and other security measures.
Trump's tweet seemed to be motivated by a Monday morning segment on CNN's ""New Day."" (The president frequently watches cable news in the morning.)

At 6:31 a.m. ET, CNN political director David Chalian showed CNN/ORC's latest poll results, starting with 44% approval and 53% disapproval of Trump's job performance.
Then he said, ""What about that travel ban policy? How's the country reacting to that? A majority are opposed. Slim majority. 53% of Americans oppose the travel ban, 47% in favor.""
The poll is a scientific sample of the American population at large.
Trump's tweet provoked widespread criticism on Monday morning. ""This is bizarre behavior. Something is not right,"" Joaquin Castro, a Democratic congressman from Texas, responded.
Another vocal Trump critic, the activist Deray McKesson, tweeted, ""'Negative news = fake news' is the beginning of tyranny.""
It came on the same morning that one of Trump's friends, Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy, was quoted in The New York Times saying, ""I think, in his mind, the success of this is going to be the poll numbers.""

Throughout his adult life, Trump has cared deeply about various measures of his popularity, including magazine cover appearances, television ratings and rally crowd sizes.
But he is starting his presidency with historically low approval ratings and widespread opposition to some of his administration's policies.
That's why some observers have expected Trump to try to discredit approval rating polls.
On the campaign trail, Trump bragged about polls that were favorable for him, sometimes reading the data aloud during rallies. When the polls turned sour, he made unfounded claims about ""crooked polls.""
In mid-January, shortly before taking office, Trump resumed his poll denialism.
""The same people who did the phony election polls, and were so wrong, are now doing approval rating polls. They are rigged just like before,"" he wrote.
The polls are not rigged. While imperfect to be sure, polling is a science, and experts work hard to reflect the country's views as accurately as possible.
Some pre-election polls were far off the mark, especially in swing states, for reasons that are now being studied by experts. These state polls caused many analysts to anticipate a Clinton victory on election night. But the national polls were by and large accurate.
Related: In their own words: The story of covering Election Night 2016
""The polls that had Clinton winning the popular vote were accurate,"" CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted in response to Trump on Monday.
At last Friday's White House briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer was asked about Trump's low approval ratings. He responded with a somewhat sunnier poll from Rasmussen.
""I think there's also a Rasmussen poll that showed he had a 51% approval rating,"" Spicer said.
In fact, Rasmussen showed Trump at 54% approval, but the numbers are not exactly comparable to the other, lower approval polls. Why? Because Rasmussen surveyed a subset of people it defines as ""likely voters"" in elections. Most approval polls seek a sample of all adults, not just ""likely voters,"" in order to ascertain the views of the entire population.
Spicer, on Friday, did not decry the polling data as ""fake news,"" but instead predicted it would improve.
""The president understands this is a marathon, and not a sprint,"" Spicer said. ""And as he continues to get people back to work, protect this country, I think the poll numbers will act in accord.""
By dismissing negative poll numbers as ""fake news,"" Trump seems to be contradicting his press secretary again."

","President Donald Trump on Wednesday lashed out at CNN reporter Jeremy Diamond after he asked the president why the situation on the southern border has only become a “national emergency” since the Democrats won back the House of Representatives.
During a question-and-answer session with reporters, the president tried to claim that there has been a “national emergency” on the border for years now and he pointed to past statements by former President Barack Obama about a flood of migrant children at the border to back up his point.
Diamond, however, countered that Trump has now been president for two years and has still not secured funding for his supposed top priority, even when Republicans ran both chambers of Congress.
“Look, look, you can all play cute,” Trump angrily replied. “And I’d say 80 percent of you are in passive coordination with the opposition party!”

progressive,"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/12/jeff-sessions-said-secularists-are-unfit-for-government.html
","Senator Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general, has come under fire for accepting an award from right-wing extremist David Horowitz.
What Sessions said when he accepted it may prove to be even more explosive.
“Ultimately, freedom of speech is about ascertaining the truth,” Sessions, an Alabama Republican, told Horowitz’s audience on Nov. 14, 2014. “And if you don’t believe there’s a truth, you don’t believe in truth, if you’re an utter secularist, then how do we operate this government? How can we form a democracy of the kind I think you and I believe in… I do believe that we are a nation that, without God, there is no truth, and it’s all about power, ideology, advancement, agenda, not doing the public service.”
The comments have not been previously reported, nor have any of Sessions’s colleagues asked about them at his confirmation hearings.
While plenty of elected officials may hold similar beliefs, Sessions is a nominee for attorney general, the chief law enforcement officer in the country. His comments raise questions as to which set of “truths,” religious or secular, would motivate his Justice Department’s decisions on which laws to prosecute, which liberties to protect, and which interpretations of legal and constitutional texts to adopt.
“It goes against the values our country was founded on to intertwine religion and government in the way that Sessions described,” Michael Keegan, president of the liberal advocacy group People for the American Way, told The Daily Beast. “The equality of every American, regardless of his or her religious beliefs or nonbelief, is one of the core principles of our democracy. If Jeff Sessions can’t understand that, he’s unfit to serve as attorney general.”
Indeed, to describe freedom of speech as being about “ascertaining the truth” flies in the face of 200 years of Supreme Court precedent, which protects artistic expression, commercial speech, and free expression of all types, regardless of whether they are intended to ascertain the truth.
Other comments made to Horowitz’s “Freedom Center” raise further questions regarding Sessions’s beliefs.
“I’ve seen some great people receive this [award], David, and it’s a special treat and pleasure for me because you know how much I admire you as we battle for, I think, for right and justice and law and American people’s legitimate interests and expectations from their government,” Sessions said.
At the time, the most recent recipients of the “Daring the Odds” award included the extreme anti-Muslim blogger Pamela Geller and former Senator Russell Pearce, who was the co-author of Arizona’s draconian anti-immigrant law. (This year, it was awarded to alt-right icon Milo Yiannapoulos.)
And at an earlier Freedom Center event, held on Feb. 13, 2013, Sessions praised Horowitz for having made a “profound contributions to the conservative movement,” and praised his book A Point in Time as being “a good book, a wise book, well in the tradition of the Western heritage of faith and reason.” Sessions stated that after reading Horowitz’s book Radicals, “I had an epiphany.” Sessions telephoned Horowitz who “gave me some ideas… it’ll make a difference in how we approach things.”
Most recently, of course, Sessions described Horowitz as “brilliant” at his confirmation hearing.
The close relationship between the two, which Sessions effusively described four years ago but omitted from the questionnaire he provided to the Senate, raises questions about how Sessions regards Horowitz’s “profound contributions,” which often tilt to the extreme far right.
For example, Horowitz has accused Hillary Clinton and Grover Norquist of being secret agents of the Muslim Brotherhood. In 2014, shortly before Sessions received his award, Horowitz called Nancy Pelosi a “Jew-hating bitch” on Twitter. In 2016, he called anti-Trump conservative Bill Kristol a “renegade Jew.” Other choice quotes include “No people have shown themselves as so morally sick as the Palestinians” and that African-American “demands for special treatment” are “only necessary because some blacks can’t seem to locate the ladder of opportunity within reach of others.”
Horowitz has also attracted controversy by drawing an annual salary in 2013 of $540,000 and for his subsidizing the work of Geller, Robert Spencer (cited 162 times by Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik), and conspiracy theorists.
Horowitz’s website, FrontPageMag, regularly incites rage in broad hit pieces, such as one a few weeks ago calling President Obama’s Chanukah party an “abomination of a mockery,” calling rabbis in attendance “Rabbis” and calling an Orthodox yeshiva “leftist.” Headlines on today’s front page alone include “Obama says goodbye to a nation he despises”; “You can’t fight anti-Semitism without exposing Islamophobia as a lie”; and one describing the joint intelligence report on Russian hacking as a “one-sided report [that] smells like a political hatchet job.”
Sessions has attended at least five of Horowitz’s Freedom Center conferences, and, so far at least, has doubled down in his support of Horowitz himself.
But it is the 2014 remarks that raise the greatest questions about the prospective attorney general, for they constitute not merely an embrace of Horowitz’s extremism but a theocratic vision of American democracy at odds with that of the Founding Fathers—not to mention a misunderstanding of “secularists” who, from Mark Twain to Stephen Hawking, Thomas Jefferson (a deist), to Elizabeth Cady Stanton, have often been very interested in the pursuit of truth.
If Sessions believes that without God, there is no truth, and that secularists cannot “operate” the government, how will he discharge his duties to enforce the rule of (secular) law, investigate the truth or falsity of crucial allegations, and ensure that all people are treated equally?"

John Davis remembers a meeting in 1986 when Bernie Sanders, then the mayor of Burlington, Vermont, confronted the owners of the city’s largest affordable-housing complex. The federal program that had subsidized the Northgate Apartments for 20 years had a loophole that allowed the landlords to convert the buildings into market rentals or luxury condos.
“Bernie pounded his fist on the conference table in his office and told the owners, ‘Over my dead body are you going to displace 336 working families. You are not going to convert Northgate into luxury housing,’” recalled Davis, who was Sanders’s key housing aide.
Under Sanders’s leadership, the city adopted a number of laws to stifle the owners’ plans. One ordinance required apartment owners to give residents two years’ notice before a condo conversion. Others gave residents a pre-emptive right to buy the units and prohibited landlords from bulldozing buildings unless they replaced them with the same number of affordable units. (These measures lowered the selling price of the property.) Sanders then worked with the state government and Senator Patrick Leahy to get the $12 million needed to purchase and rehabilitate the buildings. The city allocated funds to help the tenants hire an organizer, form the Northgate Residents Association, and start the process of converting the complex to resident ownership. Today, Northgate Apartments is owned by the tenants and has long-term restrictions to keep the buildings affordable for working families.
The battle over Northgate Apartments illustrates Sanders’s general approach to governing. In addressing this and many other issues, he encouraged grassroots organizing, adopted local laws to protect the vulnerable, challenged the city’s business power brokers, and worked collaboratively with other politicians to create a more livable city.
Now that Sanders is running for president, the eight years he spent as Burlington’s chief executive (1981–89) will be under close scrutiny. Although President Obama recently joked at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner that Sanders is a “pot-smoking socialist,” he was actually a hardworking, pragmatic, effective mayor who helped transform Vermont’s largest city (population: 38,000) into a thriving town.
Thanks to the enduring influence of the progressive climate that Sanders and his allies helped to create in Burlington, the city’s largest housing development is now resident-owned, its largest supermarket is a consumer-owned cooperative, one of its largest private employers is worker-owned, and most of its people-oriented waterfront is publicly owned. Its publicly owned utility, the Burlington Electric Department, recently announced that Burlington is the first American city of any decent size to run entirely on renewable electricity.
* * *
Sanders grew up in Brooklyn and attended the University of Chicago, where he was active in the civil-rights movement. After a short stint living on an Israeli kibbutz, in 1964 he moved to Vermont, where he worked as a carpenter, filmmaker, writer, and researcher, and got involved in radical politics. In the 1970s, after joining the antiwar Liberty Union Party, Sanders ran for several statewide offices, including governor, US Senate, and the US House (Vermont has only one seat). He never garnered more than 4 percent of the vote, but he did better in Burlington than in Vermont’s rural areas, which gave him hope that he had a shot at winning office in the local government.
In 1981, Sanders ran for mayor of Burlington as an Independent and defeated six-term Democratic Party incumbent Gordon Paquette by ten votes in a four-way contest. Voters re-elected Sanders three times by increasingly wider margins: 52 percent in 1983, 55 percent in 1985, and 56 percent in 1987.
Burlington was no hippie counterculture enclave. Although the city attracted many young, educated people because of its natural beauty and the presence of the University of Vermont, it has always had a large working-class population (many of them from French Canadian stock) who, until Sanders came on the scene, tended to vote for moderate Democrats and Republicans. Each time he ran for mayor, Sanders attracted increasing support from the city’s blue-collar precincts.
In his first two years in office, the City Council refused to allow Sanders to hire more than a handful of staff, while the entrenched bureaucrats in City Hall sought to thwart his initiatives. Randy Kamerbeek, the city’s planning director, “tried to sabotage everything that Bernie proposed,” recalled Michael Monte, who worked in that agency. “He told us not to allow Bernie to have any visible successes. He figured Bernie would be out of office after his first term.”
After he was re-elected in 1983, and voters swept in a more progressive City Council, Sanders gained a stronger foothold in City Hall. With the support of local Republicans and business leaders, he created the Community and Economic Development Office (CEDO) to carry out his vision for more affordable housing, more locally owned small businesses, greater community engagement in planning, and job development.
When Sanders took office, Burlington’s Lake Champlain waterfront was an industrial wasteland. Tony Pomerleau, an influential local businessman, planned a mega-project that included a 150-room hotel, retail space, a 100-slip marina, and 240 condominiums in 18-story buildings. In his first campaign, Sanders pledged to kill that plan. After Pomerleau withdrew his proposal, Sanders backed another waterfront plan that included some commercial development, affordable housing, and generous public access. But after voters defeated a bond measure for this proposal, Sanders went back to the drawing board to envision a “people’s waterfront.”
According to Monte, who worked on the waterfront project for Sanders and was CEDO director for 12 years, “Bernie wanted to make sure that it was a place with plenty of open space and public access, where ordinary people could rent a rowboat and buy a hot dog. That wasn’t just for the elite. It was Bernie who set the tone that the waterfront wasn’t for sale.”
Thanks to Sanders, the Burlington waterfront now has a community boathouse and other facilities for small boats. There’s also a sailing center and science center, a fishing pier, an eight-mile bike path, acres of parkland, and public beaches. The commercial development is modest and small-scale. On May 26, Sanders kicked off his presidential campaign with a rally at Waterfront Park.
Most of Burlington’s business leaders initially distrusted Sanders. They didn’t know what a socialist would do once he held the reins of power. But even many of Sanders’s early opponents came to respect and even admire his willingness to listen to their views and his efforts to adopt progressive municipal policies.
Pomerleau was then—and remains today, at 97—one of Burlington’s richest residents. A longtime Republican, he made his money developing supermarkets, hotels, and shopping centers, and he owns much of Burlington’s commercial real estate. For decades, he has wielded considerable political influence, served as chair of the city’s police commission, and been its most generous philanthropist.
“When [Sanders] first ran for mayor, he was running against guys like me,” Pomerleau recalled in a recent interview.
Pomerleau, who voted against Sanders in 1981, knocked on his door the day after that election. “I said, ‘You’re the mayor, but it’s still my town,’” he recalled.
Pomerleau wasn’t happy when Sanders opposed his waterfront development plan, but he gradually got to know the mayor and came to admire his pragmatism, his bulldog tenacity to get things done, and his support for the local police.
“Bernie and I worked very well together for the betterment of the town,” Pomerleau said. “We were the odd couple.”
Pomerleau voted for Sanders in his three successful bids for re-election. And Sanders frequently called Pomerleau to ask his advice. They stayed in close contact, even after Sanders was elected to Congress.
Pomerleau expressed his pleasure that for the past 35 years Sanders has never missed one of his annual Christmas parties for underprivileged children. He also praised Sanders for being a stalwart supporter of America’s military veterans.
“If more rich people were like me,” Pomerleau said, “Bernie would feel better about the wealthy.”
* * *
“When Bernie first got elected, the local media said he was anti-business,” recalled Bruce Seifer, an architect of Sanders’s economic development efforts. “They called us the ‘Sanderistas.’”
After Sanders’s re-election victory in 1983, business groups concluded they could not defeat him and thus had to work with him. But many businesspeople also saw that Sanders shared their interest in “development”—what he saw as “good development”—while opposing projects that would hurt middle- and working-class neighborhoods or victimize low-wage workers.
“Bernie was never anti-growth, anti-development, or anti-business,” explained Monte. “He just wanted businesses to be responsible toward their employees and the community. He wanted local entrepreneurs to thrive. He wanted people to have good jobs that pay a living wage. If you could deal with that, you could deal with Bernie and Bernie would deal with you.”
The Sanders administration provided new firms with seed funding, offered technical assistance, helped businesses form trade associations (including the South End Arts and Business Association and the Vermont Convention Bureau), focused attention on helping women become entrepreneurs, funded training programs to give women access to nontraditional jobs, and lobbied the state government to promote business growth.
When Sanders took office, Burlington had no supermarket in the downtown area. The major grocery chains told city officials that they would invest in a new store only if they could build a mega-market that residents believed was too large. Instead, the Sanders administration put its hopes in the local Onion River Cooperative. With 2,000 members in its former location, some thought it was a risky venture. It turned out to be a good investment, and under Sanders’s successor it became City Market, a thriving enterprise with more than 9,000 members.
Under Sanders, Burlington became a magnet for attracting and incubating locally owned businesses, many of which expanded into large enterprises. Burton, the nation’s largest snowboard company, has its headquarters (as well as a snowboard museum) in Burlington. The city assisted Seventh Generation, a green cleaning-products firm, when it started in 1988. Today, with its downtown waterfront headquarters in a LEED-certified building and over $300 million in annual sales, it is one of Burlington’s largest employers. With the city’s help, Gardeners Supply Company, which sells environmentally friendly gardening products, moved to Burlington in 1983. Four years later, its founder, Will Raap, began the process of selling the firm to its workers. It now has over 250 employee-owners.
As he was transitioning Gardeners Supply to employee ownership, Raap also began organizing volunteers to clean up a largely derelict floodplain north of the store. Eventually CEDO, Sanders’s development agency, helped arrange the purchase of the area and provided the capital for irrigation systems, farm vehicles, and washing stations for vegetables. By the end of the 1990s, it was home to a dozen urban farms, annually producing over 500,000 pounds of food for local homes and stores. Today it generates over 10 percent of the food sold in Burlington.
“Bernie realized that the economy doesn’t have to be dominated by bad guys,” explained Raap, a founder of the 750-member Burlington-based Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility, an alternative trade association. “He saw that and he fostered it.”
Burlington’s strong economy and population growth put pressure on the city’s housing supply, threatening to displace low- and middle-income families. Under Sanders, the city adopted policies to create permanently affordable housing. The city channeled a large portion of its federal block grant funds to nonprofits committed to that goal, and cultivated a constituency of these small development organizations. The first key move was support for the Burlington Community Land Trust with an initial $200,000 grant. Now named the Champlain Housing Trust, the nonprofit has over $290 million in assets; manages a portfolio of 2,800 price-controlled houses, condos, co-ops, and rentals; and owns over 120,000 square feet of commercial space and nonprofit facilities.
To provide funding for new housing initiatives, the Sanders-led city created a housing trust fund, capitalized in part by a 1 percent increase in property taxes. A year after Sanders left office, the coalition he built successfully pushed the City Council to enact an inclusionary zoning law. Market-rate residential projects were required to set aside 10–25 percent of the units at rents and prices affordable to families with modest incomes and to keep them affordable for 99 years.
The Sanders administration carefully nurtured neighborhood planning assemblies (NPA) in each of the city’s six wards, providing them with modest budgets to deliberate and advise on projects affecting their neighborhoods. The NPAs had a voice over the use of federal Community Development Block Grant funds in their neighborhoods. Today, Burlingtonians credit the NPAs with raising the level of resident participation and discussion in local politics.
Sanders jump-started the city’s participatory energies in other ways as well. Early on he established a Youth Office, an Arts Council, and a Women’s Council, whose first major initiative was an ordinance requiring 10 percent of all city-funded construction jobs to be filled by women.
* * *
Sanders’s track record as mayor was so successful that Burlington voters elected his CEDO director, Peter Clavelle, to succeed him in 1989. (He was voted out in 1993 but re-elected in 1995, and served until 2006.) During his 16 years in the mayor’s office, Clavelle expanded Sanders’s agenda. A Republican held the office from 1993 to 1995, and another independent progressive, Bob Kiss, served from 2006 through 2012. After a controversy erupted over the city-owned Burlington Telecom, Kiss declined to run for re-election.
In 2012, for the first time since Sanders’s first campaign in 1981, Burlington elected a Democrat—Miro Weinberger—to serve as mayor. Although more conservative than Sanders, Clavelle, and Kiss, he has been reluctant to reverse their policies because they’ve been so popular. Burlington’s progressives have not only held on to their main policy achievements but, after the most recent election, have gained seats on the City Council and catapulted Progressive Party member Jane Knodell into the presidency of that body.
In the 1970s and ’80s, Sanders was one of a handful of mayors—including Paul Soglin of Madison, Wisconsin; Gus Newport of Berkeley, California; Ruth Goldway of Santa Monica, California; Chicago’s Harold Washington; and Boston’s Ray Flynn—who sought to use the levers of local government to adopt enlightened progressive policies. More than in any other city, Burlington’s progressives consolidated those reforms over the long haul. The coalition that coalesced around Sanders in 1981 governed Burlington for all but two of the next 31 years.
Burlington is now widely heralded as an environmentally friendly, lively, and livable city with a thriving economy, including one of the lowest jobless rates in the country. Burlingtonians give Sanders credit for steering the city in a new direction that, despite early skepticism, proved to be broadly popular with voters.
A growing number of cities—including Seattle, New York, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Newark, and others—are now led by progressive mayors. They are adopting municipal minimum wage laws, requiring developers to build mixed-income housing, strengthening regulations against corporate polluters, and enacting other policies to address the nation’s growing economic inequality and environmental crises.
What they can learn from Sanders is that good ideas are not sufficient. Creating more livable cities requires nurturing a core of activist organizations that can build long-term support for progressive municipal policies."

","In a round of polling conducted this month, Gallup figured out which of those ideas was the most popular. And the result? It's sort of a three-way tie.
Well over half of Americans want to replace Obamacare with a single-payer system. That figure, amazingly, includes 41 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents — even though the wording of the question specifies that the program would be ""federally funded."" (Mind you, more than half of Republicans oppose the idea.)

The high number of Republicans approving of the idea may be because Republicans are so hostile to the Affordable Care Act. Gallup's polling has consistently shown that Republicans hold strongly negative views of the program. Replacing the ACA with anything probably holds some appeal.
On the Clinton-versus-Sanders question, Democrats are slightly more inclined to back Clinton's theory than Sanders's. Nearly 8 in 10 Democrats want to keep the ACA in place; just under three-quarters want to replace it with single-payer. (Only 16 percent of Republicans want to keep the ACA, which is why single-payer gets the highest support overall.) It's not that simple, though. Fifty-nine percent of Democrats support the idea of both keeping the ACA and replacing it with a single-payer program. Asked to pick between the two, though, that group favors single-payer by a 2-to-1 margin.
What's suggested by these poll results is something of a muddle. Democrats are happy with the ACA but would love single-payer. Republicans hate the ACA and a majority still oppose a federally funded program. The pragmatic result is stasis, which is what Clinton has embraced: making the ACA more palatable and expansive, instead of restarting the fight she lost while her husband was president."

","Here's a brief economic history of the last quarter-century in taxes and growth.
In 1990, President George H. W. Bush raised taxes, and GDP growth increased over the next five years. In 1993, President Bill Clinton raised the top marginal tax rate, and GDP growth increased over the next five years. In 2001 and 2003, President Bush cut taxes, and we faced a disappointing expansion followed by a Great Recession.
Does this story prove that raising taxes helps GDP? No. Does it prove that cutting taxes hurts GDP? No.
But it does suggest that there is a lot more to an economy than taxes, and that slashing taxes is not a guaranteed way to accelerate economic growth.
That was the conclusion from David Leonhardt's new column today for The New York Times, and it was precisely the finding of a new study from the Congressional Research Service, ""Taxes and the Economy: An Economic Analysis of the Top Tax Rates Since 1945.""
Analysis of six decades of data found that top tax rates ""have had little association with saving, investment, or productivity growth."" However, the study found that reductions of capital gains taxes and top marginal rate taxes have led to greater income inequality. Past studies cited in the report have suggested that a broad-based tax rate reduction can have ""a small to modest, positive effect on economic growth"" or ""no effect on economic growth."""

","Employers may argue that professional experience gained via an internship pays for itself - which is hopefully the case, as most of the presidential candidates are not prepared to pay you to work for them.
A new study has revealed that only one presidential hopeful out of a total of 16 candidates pays their interns.
Bernie Sanders, Vermont Senator and Democrat, pays his interns $10.10 per hour, as reported by The Washington Post.
Christina Greer, assistant professor of political science at Fordham University, and Alexis Grenell, a political strategist and columnist, hired a student at $15 per hour to find out how each candidate employs interns.
Despite many candidates discussing how to reduce student debt, which leaves seven out of 10 students down $29,000 on average upon graduation, the vast majority of the politicians use a glut of unpaid interns to propel their White House success.
Unpaid internships are also a political issue - there is a racial divide between the median wealth of white households, which is 10 and 13 times more than Hispanic and black households respectively.
In August, Hillary Clinton tweeted out an internship application, asking for a CV and two letters of reference. A few days later, she was asking students to tweet her about how “student loan debt makes you feel.”

Ms Clinton has also come under fire for accepting $675,000 speaking fees from Goldman Sachs, and has earned $153 million in speaking fees alongside her husband since 2001. Mr Sanders has revealed that he made just over $1,800 for three speeches last year and has given all the money to charity.
Republican Jeb Bush has said the opportunity gap is the “defining issue of our time” and Marco Rubio has protested against “upward-mobility stagnation”. Neither offer interns a salary.
Republican Ben Carson called for public universities to pay student loan interest. Mr Carson advertised for “paid” internships, but only covers food and travel expenses.
The only unanswered question regards real estate tycoon Donald Trump, who has accused federal government of making profit at the expense of students. He does not advertise for interns for his campaign, and did not respond to calls from The Washington Post. However he does pay his Trump Entertainment Resorts interns $10 per hour.
The candidates may not vary much on pay, but they do vary on what they require during the application process.
Former chief executive Carly Fiorina also covers expenses, and requires applications to submit a CV and respond to a series of questions. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie asks for a CV and a cover letter. Marco Rubio, the only one of these three politicians that is ascending the polls, asks for a CV, cover letter, references and answers to a series of questions.
The candidates that only ask for a CV are Republicans John Kasich, Mike Huckabee, Lindsey Graham, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, George Pataki and Jeb Bush, as well as Democrat Martin O’Malley. Mr O’Malley is the only one on this list who supports an increase in the minimum wage."

","NowThis today released unaired footage of Fox News host Tucker Carlson telling Dutch historian Rutger Bregman to go “f-ck yourself.”
The footage, released on Twitter, shows the two men talking about how the rich find ways to avoid paying taxes.
Bregman became a viral sensation late last month after going off-script during an appearance at the World Economic Forum at Davos, telling the billionaires in attendance that they should stop avoiding paying taxes.
The Utopia for Realists author was invited to appear on Carlson’s show for a presumably favorable interview, seeing as the Fox News primetime star has recently rebranded himself as a Trumpian economic populist who praises Bernie Sanders on income inequality issues while also spouting white-nationalist-friendly rants on immigration.
The pair sat down on Feb. 11, with Bregman appearing via satellite from Amsterdam, and while the conversation started out as friendly, it ultimately turned into a full-on meltdown after the historian suggested Fox News is bought and paid for by billionaires.
“I went to Davos to speak truth to power,” Bregman said of his visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “And I’m doing the exact same thing right now. You may not like it. But you’re a billionaire funded by millionaires and that’s the reason why you’re not talking about these issues.”
“But I am talking about these issues,” Carlson replied.
Bregman said that Carlson was only jumping on the bandwagon, adding that he is saying now that he’s against the “globalist elite” and that it’s not “very convincing.”
Eventually Bregman said to the conservative host: “The thing is, you guys have brought into power a president who doesn’t even want to show his own tax returns. Who knows how many billions he has hidden in the Cayman Islands or in Bermuda. So I think the issue really is one of corruption.”
And then he brought up Carlson’s own bosses at Fox: “What the Murdochs basically want you to do is to scapegoat immigrants instead of talking about tax avoidance. So I’m glad you’re now finally raising the issue, but that’s what’s been happening for the past couple of years.”
And then began Carlson’s meltdown.
When Bregman claimed that “all the anchors on Fox, they’re all millionaires,” Carlson began yelling: “Fox doesn’t even play where you are.”
“Well, have you heard of the internet?” Bregman joked, while Carlson continued to yell on the other end. “I can watch things whatever I want.”
Bregman then continued: “You’re probably not going to air this, but I went to Davos to speak truth to power and I’m doing exactly the same thing right now. You might not like it, but you’re a millionaire funded by billionaires. And that’s the reason you’re not talking about these issues.”
“But I am talking about these issues,” Carlson shot back.
“Yeah, only now,” the historian said. “You jumped the bandwagon. You’re all like, oh, I’m against the globalist elite, blah, blah, blah. It’s not very convincing to be honest.”
“I want to say to you, why don’t you go fuck yourself, you tiny brain,” Carlson roared. “And I hope this gets picked up because you’re a moron. I tried to give you a hearing, but you were too fucking annoying.”
You can’t handle the criticism, can you?” Bregman quips at the end of the footage.
The segment did not air.
But you can watch it here:

If Carlson had actually read Bregman’s book none of this would be surprising.
Matching him up against Carlson — who has railed against “gypsies,” decried immigrants for making America “dirtier” and California a “third-world country,” and said that America’s changing racial demographics represent “more change than human beings are designed to digest” — was bound to end in a fight, one for which Carlson apparently wasn’t prepared."

","TOPLINE
Postal workers in Washington State have reinstalled high-speed mail sorting machines—dismantled after controversial orders from the U.S. Postal Service— despite USPS orders not to put machines back in use.
U.S. Postal Service Postmaster General Louis DeJoy is sworn in for a virtual Senate Homeland ... [+] Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on U.S. Postal Service operations during Covid-19 pandemic August 21, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Photo by U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee via Getty Images)
KEY FACTS
After embattled Postmaster General Louis DeJoy announced he would pause recent controversial changes to U.S. Postal Service protocol, the service told workers not to reinstall removed equipment. 40 percent of the high-speed mail sorting machines in the Seattle-Tacoma area were disconnected or dismantled since the changes went into effect, according to KUOW Public Radio in Seattle, with workers in the Tacoma, Washington sorting plant saying eight of their 18 machines that sort and postmark letters were disconnected and pushed into a corner. A sorting machine in Wenatchee, Washington was also reconnected, against the orders of the Postal Service’s head of maintenance, Kevin Couch. Only two facilities, Seattle-Tacoma and one in Dallas, seem to be ignoring the Postal Service’s directive to leave decommissioned sorting machines out of use.
Key Background
Since being appointed postmaster general in May, Louis DeJoy, a prolific GOP fundraiser and Trump donor, has enacted highly controversial changes to U.S. Postal Service protocol that workers say resulted in massive delays in mail delivery, including cutting overtime for postal workers, the nationwide removal of mail collection boxes and decommissioning or dismantling of hundreds of high speed mail sorting machines across the country. The changes have led to widespread fear that the Postal Service won’t be equipped to handle the millions of mail-in ballots expected during the November election. Democrats on the state and national level have filed lawsuits against DeJoy, the USPS, and President Donald Trump arguing that the changes are an effort to curb mail-in voting during the November election. DeJoy testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Friday and is expected to testify before the House Oversight Committee on Monday.

John Horner, a 46-year-old fast-food restaurant worker, lost his eye in a 2000 accident and was prescribed painkillers. Years later, he met and befriended a guy who seemed to be in pain himself. His new friend asked if he could buy some of Horner's pain pills. Naturally, the friend was a police informant. Prosecutors in Central Florida say Horner was ultimately paid $1,800 for pills. ""My public defender told me, 'They got you dead to rights,'"" he said. ""So I thought, 'OK, I guess there's no need taking this to trial.'"" His story is recounted in a BBC News Service story about the problematic use of informants by U.S. law-enforcement agencies.
It's an important subject and the article tackles it well.
But let's focus here on the anecdote about Horner, because it gets at the utter madness of the War on Drugs. For the sake of argument, let's presume he's guilty of selling $1,800 of pain pills prescribed to him for an injury. Forget that he was arguably entrapped. Just look at the crime in isolation.
What sort of punishment should it carry?
You've got a 46-year-old employed father caught selling four bottles of prescription pain pills. ""Under Florida law Horner now faced a minimum sentence of 25 years, if found guilty,"" the BBC reports.
Twenty-five years minimum!
It costs Florida roughly $19,000 to incarcerate an inmate for a year. So I ask you, dear reader, is keeping non-violent first-time drug offender John Horner locked behind bars in a jumpsuit really the best use of $475,000? For the same price, you could pay a year's tuition for 75 students at Florida State University. You could pay the salaries of seven West Palm Beach police officers for a year. Is it accurate to call a system that demands the 25-year prison term mad?
Well. Prosecutors offered to shave years off his sentence if he became an informant himself and successfully helped send five others to prison on 25 year terms. He tried. But ""Horner failed to make cases against drug traffickers,"" says the BBC. ""As a result, he was sentenced to the full 25 years in October last year and is now serving his sentence in Liberty Correctional Institution.""
Naturally.
""He will be 72 by the time he is released.""

","Fake news published in the U.S. was overwhelmingly consumed and shared by right-wing social media users, a new study from the University of Oxford has revealed.
Research from Oxford's ""computational propaganda project"" investigated into the sources of ""junk news"" shared in the three months leading up to President Donald Trump's first State of the Union address last month.
On Facebook, they found that ""extreme hard-right"" conservatives shared more fake news stories than all other political groups combined, while on Twitter, Trump supporters consumed the most fake news.
""On Twitter, a network of Trump supporters consumes the largest volume of junk news, and junk news is the largest proportion of news links they share,"" they said.
Researchers monitored 13,500 politically-active U.S. Twitter users and 48,000 public Facebook pages, investigating the external websites they shared links to.
Researchers said there was ""limited overlap"" of news sources shared between Democrats and Republicans, which they said speaks to the polarization that exists across the U.S. political divide.

They warned that social media algorithms can be used to distribute polarizing political content and misinformation, adding that ""filter bubble effects,"" which select what information to show in news feeds based on user preferences and behavior, have ""polarized public life,"" which could leave consumers vulnerable to propaganda campaigns.
""Given the central role that social media plays in public life, these platforms have become a target for propaganda campaigns and information operations,"" researchers wrote.
They pointed to a recent U.S. elections review by Twitter that found that more than 50,000 automated accounts were linked to Russia.

But, Krugman asserted, Trump's biggest fans don't care.
""A thought about where we are as a nation: We're living in the age of the unsurprising revelation. Is there anyone who doesn't already believe that Trump-Putin-treason is a real thing? Even Trump loyalists surely know it's true, they just think it's an OK price for the racism,"" Krugman tweeted.
He then added, ""The question instead is when and whether the evidence will become so dramatic, so blatant, that Trump's defenders won't feel able to keep pretending they don't know. That is, it's not really about what we learn but about how it plays.""

","Here's the big headline at Vox right now:
By picking Tom Price to lead HHS, Trump shows he’s absolutely serious about dismantling Obamacare
Apparently, up until now the intelligentsia wasn't quite sure that Republicans meant it the eighty thousand times they told us that their most important domestic policy goal was the end of Obamacare. They were just joking! It was an elaborate, sustained bit of performance art!
No, really, guys, Republicans were serious. Trump knew they were serious, and Trump's going for it, just as every other Republican who had a chance to win the party's presidential nomination would have gone for it.
From the Vox story:
Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for health and human services secretary, already has a plan for how to abolish Obamacare.... Price ... is the author of the Empowering Patients First Act, one of the most thorough and detailed proposals to repeal and replace Obamacare. He’s the HHS secretary you’d pick if you were dead serious about dismantling the law. It would replace the law with a plan that does more to benefit the young, healthy, and rich -- and disadvantages the sick, old, and poor.... The biggest cut to the poor in Price’s plan is the full repeal of the Medicaid expansion, a program that currently covers millions of low-income Americans, which Price replaces with, well, nothing.
But even if Price's plan isn't enacted as he wrote it, whatever takes the place of Obamacare will cover fewer people, and will be especially hard on those who need healthcare most. That has Paul Krugman asking,
So here’s the question: how many people just shot themselves in the face? My first pass answer is, between 3.5 and 4 million.
That's Krugman's back-of-the-envelope estimate of how many Trump voters will be thrown off the healthcare rolls.
Greg Sargent writes:
I have obtained new numbers from the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index that suggest that a lot of poor and working-class whites -- who voted for Trump in disproportionate numbers -- have benefited from Obamacare, meaning they likely stand to lose out from its repeal (and even its replacement with something that covers far fewer people). ... Gallup-Healthways tells me that among whites without a college degree who have household incomes of under $36,000, the uninsured rate has dropped from 25 percent in 2013 to 15 percent now -- a drop of 10 percentage points. ... it now looks more likely that we’ll see a substantial rollback of the progress toward universal health coverage we’ve seen in the past few years. News organizations love to venture into Trump’s America to hear voters explain that Trump spoke far more directly to their economic struggles than Democrats did. Maybe now we’ll get more coverage of those inhabitants of Trump’s America who are set to lose their health care, too.
But if you're thinking that those voters will direct their anger at Trump and fellow Republicans when their healthcare is taken away, ask yourself: Were heartland whites angry at Ronald Reagan when he busted the air traffic controllers' union, a signal event in the decline of the American labor movement? No -- a few years later their votes contributed to a 49-state landslide for Reagan. Did heartland whites rail at big banks after the 2008 financial crisis? No -- Tea Party members denounced President Obama and his fellow Democrats for alleged spending excesses and for Obamacare.
The pattern always holds. In Strangers in Their Own Land, Arlie Russell Hochschild writes about Tea Party supporters who refuse to direct their angry at the very people who do harm to them. This is from Nathaniel Rich's review of the book in The New York Review of Books:
The paradox that most baffles Hochschild is the question of environmental pollution. Even the most ideologically driven zealots don’t want to drink poisoned water, inhale toxic gas, or become susceptible to record flooding. Yet southwestern Louisiana combines some of the nation’s most fervently antiregulatory voters with its most toxic environmental conditions.... Hochschild discovers a walking personification of these ironies in a Cajun oil rig engineer named Mike Schaff. In August 2012, Schaff was entering his home in Bayou Corne, about seventy miles west of New Orleans, when he was jolted by a tremor. His concrete living room floor cracked apart. The sound, said a neighbor, was like a “garbage truck had dropped a dumpster.” More than a mile beneath the bayou, a Houston-based drilling company named Texas Brine had drilled into a vast salt dome, ignoring warnings from its own engineer.... Texas Brine drills for salt, which it sells to chlorine manufacturers, but other companies had used sections of the salt dome to store chemicals and oil. Texas Brine drilled too closely to an oil deposit and the structure ruptured, sucking down forest and causing seismic damage to the homes of 350 nearby residents. Officials began referring to Schaff’s neighborhood as the “sacrifice zone.” Texas Brine refused to take responsibility for the accident.... Four years later the sinkhole is 750 feet deep at its center and has grown to thirty-five acres. Methane and other gases bubble up periodically. Residents who defied evacuation orders avoided lighting matches. ... [Schaff] marched on the statehouse, wrote fifty letters to state and federal officials, granted dozens of interviews to local, national, and foreign press. When state officials claimed they had detected no oil in the bayou, he demanded that the EPA check their work. But Schaff continued to vote Tea Party down the line. He voted for the very politicians who had abetted Texas Brine at every turn, who opposed environmental regulation of any kind. He voted to “abolish” the EPA, believing that it “was grabbing authority and tax money to take on a fictive mission…lessening the impact of global warming.” The violent destruction of everything he held dear was not enough to change his mind.
(Emphasis added.)
And among Hochschild's subjects, Schaff isn't alone:
When asked about catastrophic oil spills that result from lax regulation, one woman says, “It’s not in the company’s own interest to have a spill or an accident…. So if there’s a spill, it’s probably the best the company could do.” Madonna Massey says: “Sure, I want clean air and water, but I trust our system to assure it.” Jackie Tabor, whom Hochschild describes as “an obedient Christian wife,” says: “You have to put up with things the way they are…. Pollution is the sacrifice we make for capitalism” ...
After repeal, the Trumpers will get inadequate insurance, or no insurance -- and they won't blame Trump, or the greedy insurance companies that won't cover them adequately. If they blame anyone, they'll blame the usual suspects: Democrats, liberals, ""big government"" (yes, even if the new system is far more privatized). It's what heartland whites always do. Don't expect it to change.

","In the days since Hillary Clinton’s stunning electoral defeat to Donald Trump, the vacuum she left atop the Democratic Party hasn’t gone unfilled.
Elizabeth Warren has moved aggressively to occupy the space, a timely reminder to the party and its most ambitious members that all roads to 2020 — not to mention 2018 — go through her.
More than any other high-profile Democrat, the Massachusetts senator and liberal hero has gone out of her way to appear in Washington headlines nearly every day since Nov. 8. From a series of public appearances across town to letters from her Senate office to private Capitol Hill meetings with fellow elected officials, Warren is making clear that she intends to use her brand of no-holds-barred liberalism to illuminate the party’s path ahead while it embarks on a protracted period of soul-searching.
“This is a moment that cries out for Sen. Warren’s fiery leadership, and she is bringing the fire,” said Ben Wikler, the Washington director of MoveOn.org. ""Progressives are beleaguered, they need a call to action, and she’s delivering it.""
Her message: While Democrats can try to find common ground with Trump on certain issues, it’s more important than ever for the party to assert itself against the president-elect every step of the way, from loudly holding him accountable for his “drain the swamp” rhetoric to vigorously opposing his appointment of “a bigot beloved by white supremacists.""
In Warren’s estimation, the time for mourning is over. Clinton — who Warren endorsed after her primary against Bernie Sanders — and the 2016 election are in the past. The future is now, and it requires that Democrats understand how Trump’s economic message appealed to voters Clinton couldn’t reach.
“Given what's just happened, there really is a question: Who are the leaders of the party? It’s great to see her doing all that. I can tell you from being on the ground here in Ohio, no one electrifies voters like Elizabeth Warren,” said David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. “There is a little bit of a void, and I think her voice coming through loud and clear is great.""
Warren’s forceful ascension lands at a delicate time for Democrats, who are both looking for a new generation of leaders and puzzling through how to work with — or against — a Trump White House. That search is taking place against a backdrop of upheaval within party leadership across the board: Sen. Chuck Schumer will replace longtime Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid; the Democratic National Committee will elect a new chairman; and even Nancy Pelosi, the party’s longtime House leader, is getting a challenge.
But the irreverent first-term senator is one of the few with the stature to break through the muddle, and her move to promote her brand of no-apologies progressive warfare could have longer-term implications for the party’s direction, an emerging dynamic that’s cheered by liberals but far from embraced by the whole of the party.
Warren is hardly alone in seeking to shape the agenda, and Sanders has himself also been active, looking to reawaken his millions of supporters and voter networks across the country as he pushes Rep. Keith Ellison for DNC chair — an endorsement Warren has seconded. The Vermont senator has formally joined the Senate Democratic leadership ranks (like Warren), and is busy delivering a series of addresses promoting his new book and outlining his hopes for the opposition party during the Trump era.
But Sanders’ national profile is already much higher, so the Bostonian’s jolt in activity has been more noticeable in the capital.
It’s not that she’s aiming to give Schumer a run for his money in his formal role as the party’s highest-ranking official, or focused on anointing an acolyte at the DNC. It’s more about providing Democrats with a model for progress and a framework to talk about issues while Trump holds the White House.
“It’s really important for the Democratic Party to be aggressively articulating who we are, what we want, and what we don’t want,” said DNC vice chairman R.T. Rybak, a former Minneapolis mayor. ""The lesson we should’ve learned from the first six months of the Reagan administration is if you’re not ready at the start, you’re going to get run over and spend many years trying to undo a lot of stuff. So I strongly applaud Democrats who want to stand up.""
A large part of Warren’s push has included meeting with important Democratic constituencies to influence their conversations and use their platforms. With labor leaders cheering her on as one of their most prominent advocates, she spoke at the AFL-CIO just two days after Election Day, introduced by union chief Richard Trumka as “uniquely positioned to partner with us.""
“We will stand up to bigotry. No compromises on this one, ever,” she said, in a speech that didn’t mention Clinton once, but which insisted her party must tune into the economic concerns of millions who voted for Trump. ""In all its forms, we will fight back against attacks on Latinos, African-Americans, women, Muslims, immigrants, disabled Americans — on anyone. Whether Donald Trump sits in a glass tower or sits in the White House, we will not give an inch on this.""
Four days later, at a closed-door meeting of the liberal Democracy Alliance donor network, Warren insisted that Democrats need to step up their economic appeal to everyday voters. Two days after that, she privately met with the Congressional Progressive Caucus on the Hill to talk through the election’s results and lessons.
""It is a false choice to say fighting on economic issues means you don't fight on discrimination issues. Those issues were joined together by Martin Luther King in the 1963 March on Washington, and it is as important today — maybe more important — to join those issues together,"" said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""It is about signaling to the country how we actually do big things while being good, and not being racist, and not being discriminatory, and not being xenophobic.""
A pair of formal letters signed by Warren have also drawn notice.
First came a detailed eight-page note on Tuesday, addressed to Trump himself, that ripped into him for appointing Wall Street officials and lobbyists to his transition team despite his promises to cleave such insiders’ influence.
“If you truly stand by your commitment to making government work for all Americans — not just those with armies of lobbyists on payroll — you must remove the lobbyists and financial bigwigs from your transition team and reinstate a group of advisors who will fight for the interests of all Americans,” Warren wrote. “Maintaining a transition team of Washington insiders sends a clear signal to all who are watching you — that you are already breaking your campaign promises to ‘drain the swamp’ and that you are selling out the American public.”
Warren’s team posted the missive on her Facebook page, and it was viewed over 10 million times in the ensuing two days.
Moves like sending that letter go “beyond rhetoric, and point a laser beam at the hypocrisy and potential for promise-breaking, and that’s the kind of merciless, principled opposition that’s going to be called for. And frankly it’s the right model for the rest of the Democratic caucus and for progressives everywhere,” said Wikler. “Before it was, ‘Don’t boo, vote.’ Now it’s, ‘Don’t boo, fight.’ This is how you fight.""
The next day, Warren joined the chorus of Democrats opposing Trump’s choice of chief White House strategist Steve Bannon, writing to a group of banking industry honchos alongside Ellison, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and California Rep. Maxine Waters to ask the recipients to pressure Trump against Bannon — “a bigot beloved by white supremacists and supported by the American Nazi Party and the KKK.""
The flurry of action has not gone unnoticed among her Republican detractors, some of whom say they relish the chance to caricature Democrats as the out-of-touch party of a former Harvard Law School professor.
""If Elizabeth Warren were to become the new leader of the Democratic Party, that would be great news for Republicans. Warren had a terrible election night. After she sat out most of the primary, drawing all those negative headlines, once she finally did endorse Clinton she became one of the lead surrogates for her, and Clinton lost to someone who had a 60 percent disapproval rating,” said Colin Reed, a senior adviser to former Republican Sen. Scott Brown when he ran against Warren, and now the executive director of the America Rising opposition research firm.
“Her message has no appeal in middle America, and certainly red-state America. It is limited to the coasts, the academics and liberal elites,"" Reed said, noting that many of the Senate candidates Warren backed, such as Wisconsin’s Russ Feingold and Pennsylvania’s Katie McGinty, also lost on Election Day.
Meanwhile, centrist Democrats, who uniformly refuse to criticize her on the record — acknowledging in private that she is likely to be the face of the party for at least two years due to the lack of a natural successor to Clinton or Barack Obama, and the need for Schumer to focus on doing the legislative dirty work — are wary of Warren’s enhanced role. Her message of combating a “rigged system"" can only go so far after a billionaire Republican was elected to the White House with a similar theme, they insist.
Still, Warren allies are seeing evidence that her stepped-up presence — and pressure on Trump — is being felt.
“How is Donald Trump going to show that he actually heard that message [of change]?"" Warren said at the Wall Street Journal’s CEO council — hardly her home turf — a week after Election Day. ""That’s the message that he ran on, but right now what he’s doing is putting together a transition team that is full of lobbyists and the kind of people he actually ran against. So part of what we have to assess here is, ‘What is the mandate coming out?’ And I think that the clearest point that comes out of this election is that the American people do not want Wall Street to run their government. They do not want corporate executives to be the ones calling the shots in Washington.”
The next day, Vice President-elect Mike Pence started kicking lobbyists out of the transition operation."

","Only weeks after giving up on his lackluster presidential campaign in the face of national indifference, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin is back to making mischief in his home state. Last Friday, Mr. Walker signed a bill to protect public officials like himself from an effective and well-established tool for rooting out political corruption.
The tool, known as the John Doe law, lets prosecutors conduct secret investigations into possible crimes by executing search warrants and compelling people to testify. It is essentially a grand jury proceeding, with a judge rather than jurors deciding whether there is enough evidence for an indictment.
Mr. Walker has been a target of two John Doe investigations in recent years. The first, which looked into misconduct by his aides or associates while he served as Milwaukee county executive, led to six convictions. The second involved allegations of illegally coordinated fund-raising between Mr. Walker’s campaign for governor and conservative political groups. In July, a deeply split Wisconsin Supreme Court — several of whose justices were backed by the same groups in their election campaigns — shut down the investigation, adopting an unprecedented reading of the state’s campaign-finance laws to find no problem with the activities in question. Mr. Walker was not charged in either case.
Under the new law, which passed on party-line votes in the Republican-controlled Legislature, neither of these investigations would be permitted. Bribery, official misconduct, campaign-finance violations and many other election law offenses — all are now exempt from a law that has served Wisconsin well, and without controversy, since the mid-19th century."

","This post originally appeared at The Nation.
Democracy has taken very hard hits in the first days of the Trump interregnum, as Donald Trump and the mandarins of his “alternative-fact” administration have spun fantasies about “voter fraud” that clearly does not exist; obsessed about the dubious legitimacy of a president who lost the popular vote and drew a disappointing crowd for his inauguration; and attacked the free and skeptical press that provides an essential underpinning for the open discourse that sustains popular sovereignty.
But sometimes democracy wins out — in a way that could transform our politics and our governance.
Nothing has so sustained and advanced Republican dominance of the states (and of the US House of Representatives) as the gerrymandering of legislative and congressional district lines by Republican politicians who have used their overarching control of state-based redistricting processes to warp electoral competition in their favor. And few states have seen such radical gerrymandering as Scott Walker’s Wisconsin, where the governor and his allies skewed district lines so seriously that clearly contested state legislative races have become a rarity in much of a state that national elections suggest is evenly divided.
Wisconsin’s gerrymandering was so extreme that, two months ago, a federal court panel struck down Wisconsin legislative maps as unconstitutional. Walker’s Republican state attorney general appealed immediately, setting up a fight that will eventually be resolved by a US Supreme Court that legal experts say may finally be prepared to rule on behalf of competitive elections.
In our democracy, people have the right to hold their government accountable in fair, competitive elections. — Wisconsin State Sen. Mark Miller
Walker and his Republican allies, desperate to maintain their unfair advantage, asked the three-judge federal panel to delay implementation of its ruling as the appeals process goes forward.
But on Feb. 3 the judges refused to delay democracy any longer.
In a decision that was hailed as a significant victory for democracy in Wisconsin and nationally, the federal panel enjoined Wisconsin officials from using existing maps in “all future elections.” At the same time, the judges ordered Walker and the state legislature to draw new legislative-district maps by Nov. 1, 2017.
The new maps are to be used in November 2018, when Walker, the entire state assembly, and half of the state senate will be up for election.
“The decision by the federal court to require new redistricting maps by Nov. 1, 2017 is great news for Wisconsin. Voters should always pick their elected officials instead of elected officials picking them. I hope that legislative Republicans are more competent with their second chance,” said Democratic State Sen. Mark Miller, the former majority leader of the Wisconsin Senate. “In our democracy, people have the right to hold their government accountable in fair, competitive elections — I am pleased that power should finally be returned to the people of Wisconsin.”
Miller is right. While there will still be plenty of wrangling over the drawing of district lines, and while Walker and his Republican allies will keep trying to delay that process, the notion that voters have a right to cast their ballots in genuinely competitive elections is gaining traction.
This case is an actual game-changer when it comes to undoing GOP gerrymandering nationwide. — Carolyn Fiddler, Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee
That’s a big deal for Wisconsin. But it is also a big deal for the rest of a country where numerous states face legal battles over gerrymandering of legislative and congressional district lines. Walker acknowledges that “lawmakers and governors around the country are interested in this case regardless of party,” while Carolyn Fiddler of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee says that “this order presents a real chance for Wisconsin Democrats’ voices to be fairly represented in their state government. Additionally, this case is an actual game-changer when it comes to undoing GOP gerrymandering nationwide and preventing Republicans from artificially inflating their majorities via redistricting for the decade to come.”
Fiddler’s point gets to the heart of the matter. Discussions about gerrymandering involve a lot more than maps. They are about electoral competition and the makeup of legislative chambers. Fair competition, in Wisconsin and nationally, could produce dramatic change in politics and governing. For instance: In 2012 voting for state assembly seats in Wisconsin, Democrats won 174,000 more votes than Republicans. Yet, because of the gerrymandering of the assembly maps by Walker and his allies, Republicans won a 60-39 majority in the chamber.
Bill Whitford, the veteran University of Wisconsin law professor who was the lead plaintiff in the gerrymandering case brought by the Fair Elections Project, hailed the court ruling as a victory in the struggle for a renewal of representative democracy.
“Today is a good day for Wisconsin voters, and another step in the journey of ensuring that our voices are heard,” explained Whitford. “Now, we will be keeping a watchful eye on the state legislature as they draw the new maps and I ask them, for the sake of our democracy, to put partisan politics aside and the interests of all voters first.”
If the Republicans fail to put aside partisanship, they are all but certain to face another intervention by the courts in what is by any measure a high-stakes struggle.
Republicans in Wisconsin and nationally know that if Democrats were to gain a stronger foothold in the Wisconsin Assembly and Senate following a fair fight in 2018, that could position them to draw more competitive congressional-district lines following the 2020 Census. And if the US Supreme Court were to accept the premise that voters have a right to cast ballots in competitive election — rather than to waste them in districts that are drawn to give one party a permanent advantage — the American political landscape could be radically altered.
As former President Barack Obama, who has pledged to make the battle against gerrymandering a focus of his post-presidential activism, has said: “If we want a better politics, it’s not enough to just change a congressman or a senator or even a president. We have to change the system to reflect our better selves.”
The way to get that better politics is by upending gerrymandering practices that allow politicians to pick their voters, and to give the voters the power that extends from genuinely competitive elections."

","The Cleveland debate was a miniature, 90-minute version of the last 4 years: depressing, exhausting, full of craziness and lies.
Who won? I don’t know. Honestly: I cannot understand how anyone with an IQ over 80 could have watched this disgrace and not come away understanding that the president of the United States is a sociopath.
But I’ll try to put myself in the mind of voters and tell you what I saw.
Donald Trump dominated the debate. Utterly and completely. He was a doughy, orange honey-badger, yelling, shouting, cajoling, needling and—this is the important part—never shutting up. He kept ploughing ahead, no matter what. He bulldozed Chris Wallace. He bulldozed Joe Biden. He turned every question into what he wanted to talk about. He hit all of the notes he wanted: Burisma, stock market, shutdowns, Pocahontas.
If you are a fan of the Trump lifestyle brand—if you have a Trump flag on your boat and wear a MAGA hat because you love pissing off the brown girl with the nose ring at Starbucks—then I suspect that you thought this was the greatest performance by any debater in the history of debates.
So I’m going to guess that people were very happy on Parler.
Podcast · March 05 2021 Philip Rucker on The Future of the 'Very Stable Genius' On today’s Bulwark podcast, Philip Rucker of The Washington Post joins host Charlie Sykes to talk about the updates to ...
On the other hand, it’s not clear to me that Trump’s act was effective with undecided voters.
And I say this because Trump treated the debate like he was trying to win an argument between two baby mamas on a trash daytime show, while Joe Biden made a concerted effort throughout the debate to pretend that Trump wasn’t there, often talking directly to voters.
Examples: When Biden brought up the Woodward tapes and Trump’s lying to America about COVID because he didn’t want to panic the country, here’s what Biden said, as he looked straight into the camera: “You don’t panic. He panicked.”
After Trump blubbered about how great the economy is right now, Biden looked straight into the camera and asked, “You folks at home—how well are you doing?”
On one of Trump’s attempts to beat up on Hunter Biden, the vice president gestured straight into the camera and explained, “This is not about my family or his family, it’s about your family.”
The net effect of this was that Biden had a coherent message throughout: I’m on your side.
I can, however, tell you with complete certainty who lost the debate: America.
If you care at all about this country, then there are four things that should terrify you.
(1) The president of the United States was asked to condemn white nationalists and refused. He hemmed and hawed. He tried to shimmy out of it. And in the end the best he could muster was to tell the Proud Boys to “stand by.” The Proud Boys heard his message and saw it as a call to action.
(2) The president of the United States was asked to pledge to tell his supporters to remain calm following the election and to not preemptively declare victory. He flatly refused.
(3) The president of the United States said that “They came after me trying to do a coup.” And that: “We’ve caught them. We’ve caught them all.” And that one of “them” is his opponent.
(4) More than 60 million Americans are going to vote for the president of the United States.
Regardless of who wins this election, how are we supposed to make this thing—here I am referring euphemistically to our glorious experiment in self-government—work when 40 percent of the country wants this shit—here I am not being euphemistic—from their president?
Because these preferences are not based on policy differences concerning marginal tax rates or trade policy or deregulation.
A serious question: Do we need more debates?
I ask for two reasons. First, because that debate felt like it was 7 hours long. It was emotionally, spiritually, physically exhausting. And for no payoff. Nobody learned anything from this debate. And no one is going to learn anything from more debates.
In fact, I would suggest that having two more of these spectacles can only further demean our country and erode the standards we hold for the conduct of people who serve in government.
But the political reality is that Biden has to endure more of this insanity. Canceling would look weak. Voters always prefer the guy who’s willing to work hard for their votes. And this is trite but true: If you want the job of facing down Xi Jinping, you have to be able to face down a reality-show host.
Will this debate matter?
Probably not. The race is stable for a reason.
Now that in itself is bad for Trump. He’s down large and there’s very little time left on the clock. But even that doesn’t so much matter because—as Trump said at the end—his victory scenario no longer entails winning more votes.
If you take anything from Tuesday’s debate, it should be this: The president of the United States’s re-election strategy is to claw his way to victory after the fact by using the courts to throw out votes that have been cast for his opponent.
The entire affair left me feeling like Dr. Leonid Pavel."

","As the statewide Wisconsin recount continues to get underway, the recount observers representing various presidential candidates have been sharing their first hand experiences online. Observers in some counties have found no issues at all, while others have reported concerns and suspicious incidents. But one recount observer Waukesha County is now making the flat out accusation that county officials are purposely double counting Donald Trump’s votes and pulling other shenanigans during the recount.
The accusation comes from recount observer John West, who has been documenting his experiences on his own publicly visible Facebook page. On Sunday evening he flatly declared that “I’m calling out fraud.” West went on to make the following specific accusations: “Waukesha County Wisconsin is obstructing the recount blatantly. Making up rules to shut out allowed observers. Double counting Republican ballots. Taking machines out and returning machines that break down after midnight hoping to avoid any observers.”
In the comments section of his own post, linked above, he went on to elaborate that “They aren’t invalidating clear duplicate and unsigned ballots that were mailed in,” thus explaining how the double-counting is taking place.
Update: West’s post has since been removed from Facebook (or possibly turned into a private post) for unknown reasons. However, we took a screen capture of it before it disappeared:
We’re reaching out to Mr. West to ascertain whether he took the post down voluntarily, or if he’s made the post private, or if something else transpired. His Facebook page is still visible but without the post in question.
These are serious accusations of improper behavior, which if proven true would represent criminal fraud. We’re reaching out to Mr. West to determine what evidence he has in terms of documenting the behavior in question. But the mere fact that a Wisconsin observer is making these accusations is newsworthy in and of itself, as he claims to have witnessed all of the above with his own eyes. This is particularly notable in that Waukesha is one of just twelve Wisconsin counties (out of seventy-two) which have are refusing to a hand recount, instead relying on a machine recount.
The official Waukesha County vote totals, according to Politico’s tally, have Donald Trump ahead by 66,320 votes. These accusations by the recount observer call into question whether Trump legitimately received as many votes in Waukesha as the official numbers claim. Considering that Trump only leads in Wisconsin by around 20,000 votes statewide, any significant shift in Waukesha’s totals could give the state to Hillary Clinton."

Several senators, but especially Dennis Pyle (KS-SD1), Mary Pilcher-Cook (KS-SD10), Julia Lynn (KS-SD09), Jim Denning (KS-SD08), Jacob LaTurner (KS-SD13), all of whom were seen as champions of the Governor’s tax policy and who now face real challenges should feel especially concerned over the continued bad news for the Kansas economy.
The crisis for the state of Kansas may be worse than we recognize, as the Associated Press reported that the state may have less than 2 days of cash reserves. The story of Kansas revenues seems to write itself every month here in Kansas. Since the governor conducted his economic experiment, the state has seen little job creation, but tons of red ink.
While Kansas elected officials and candidates realize their job come the new year just became much more difficult, the nation has a chance to look at Kansas and take some lessons too.
As Donald Trump criss-crosses the nation, he has marketed the idea that the Kansas tax plan is the right one. Well, America, the results are in.

","Horton’s analysis comes from piecing together information in three Financial Times “deep reports.” One of these focused on Sergei Millian, the head of the Russian American Chamber of Commerce in the US at the time of Trump Jr.’s “money pouring in from Russia” claim.
Mr Millian insists his Russian American Chamber of Commerce (RACC) has nothing to do with the Russian government. He says it is funded by payments from its commercial members alone. Most of the board members are obscure entities and nearly half of their telephone numbers went unanswered when called by the Financial Times. An FT reporter found no trace of the Chamber of Commerce at the Wall Street address listed on its website.
Why was RACC’s background filled with so many holes? The Financial Times quotes former Russian MP Konstantin Borovoi in tagging the chamber as a front for intelligence operations that dates back to Soviet times.
“The chamber of commerce institutions are the visible part of the agent network . . . Russia has spent huge amounts of money on this.”
Millian helped arrange for Trump to visit Moscow in 2007, and had other outings with Trump in the states, including a visit to horse races in Miami. Millian claims that he had the right to market Trump properties in Russia.
“You could say I was their exclusive broker,” he told Ria. “Then, in 2007-2008, dozens of Russians bought apartments in Trump properties in the US.” He later told ABC television that the Trump Organisation had received “hundreds of millions of dollars” through deals with Russian businessmen.
Despite documents and photos showing Trump with Millian, Trump denied their association during the campaign.
Hope Hicks, Mr Trump’s campaign spokeswoman, said Mr Trump had “met and spoke” with Mr Millian only “on one occasion almost a decade ago at a hotel opening”.
The second Financial Times article puts Trump at the middle of a money laundering scheme, in which his real estate deals were used to hide not just an infusion of capital from Russia and former Soviet states, but to launder hundreds of millions looted by oligarchs. All Trump had to do was close his eyes to the source of the money, and suddenly empty apartments were going for top dollar.
Among the dozens of companies the Almaty lawyers say the Khrapunov laundering network used were three called Soho 3310, Soho 3311 and Soho 3203. Each was a limited liability company, meaning their ownership could easily be concealed. The companies were created in April 2013 in New York. A week later, property records show, they paid a total of $3.1m to buy the apartments that corresponded with their names in the Trump Soho, a 46-storey luxury hotel-condominium completed in 2010 in a chic corner of Manhattan.
Why would Trump’s organization make such a good means of laundering funds? Because real estate has an arbitrary value. Is that apartment worth $1 million? Two million? Why not $3 million for a buyer who really wants it? When the whole transaction is just one LLC with undisclosed ownership paying another LLC with undisclosed ownership, it’s even neater than hiding the money in an offshore account. And while some businesses require due diligence in looking at the source of funds, real estate is a bit more … flexible.
The laws regulating US real estate deals are scant, experts say. Provisions against terrorism financing in the Patriot Act, passed in the aftermath of the September 11 2001 attacks, obliged mortgage lenders to conduct “know your customer” research. But money launderers pay in cash. Sales such as those of the Trump Soho apartments have passed through this loophole, which was partially closed only this year.
Converting funds stolen overseas into property in the US and cash in the account of an LLC represented a win for both the oligarchs and Trump. Best of all, Trump’s sole requirement was that he pay scant attention to the deal—something at which he was already a proven master. For example, the actual owners of the Trump Soho were another limited liability company, Bayrock. Trump was a partner in the LLC and Bayrock cut the checks Trump received when those apartments were sold. And yet ...
In a 2011 deposition, given in a dispute over the Fort Lauderdale project, Mr Trump said he had “never really understood who owned Bayrock”. Jody Kriss, a former Bayrock finance director, has claimed in racketeering lawsuits against his former employer that Bayrock’s backers included “hidden interests in Russia and Kazakhstan”. Bayrock has denied Mr Kriss’s allegations but declined to answer questions about the source of its funds and its relationship with the Khrapunovs.
The third article digs more deeply into the origins of Bayrock and its connection with Trump. That connection … was very close.
The Republican presidential nominee and Bayrock were both based in Trump Tower and they joined forces to pursue deals around the world — from New York, Florida, Arizona and Colorado in the US to Turkey, Poland, Russia and Ukraine. Their best-known collaboration — Trump SoHo, a 46-storey hotel-condominium completed in 2010 — was featured in Mr Trump’s NBC television show The Apprentice.
This is the same group about which Trump said he “never really understood” the ownership.
“I don’t know who owns Bayrock,” Mr Trump said. “I never really understood who owned Bayrock. I know they’re a developer that’s done quite a bit of work. But I don’t know how they have their ownership broken down.”
At the very least, Trump confessed to partnering with, taking money from, and acting as a representative for a corporation whose ownership he didn’t know, in deals that totaled hundreds of millions in countries around the world. However, it seems far more likely that Trump knowingly worked with oligarchs, groups associated with the Russian government, and plain old mobsters. Why? Because he was desperate.
By the 2000s, the property developer and casino owner with ready access to the capital markets and the biggest New York banks was no more. A series of corporate bankruptcies had limited his financing options. Mr Trump had become an entertainer who portrayed a tycoon on television and licensed his name to businesses looking for a brand, leading to fee-making opportunities as disparate as Trump University and Trump Vodka.
The Trump Organization was a hollow shell and Trump was bankrupt, but Donald Trump the public figure was a “successful businessman,” a screen behind which criminal activity could be carried out on a massive scale. Throwing his name at every scheme in existence wasn’t a strategy, it was a fire sale on Trump’s respectability. Steaks? Water? Vodka? Fake real estate school? You pony up the cash, and Trump will slap his name on it. Because by the early 2000s, Trump wasn’t just broke, he had nothing left to pawn. He wasn’t a successful businessman, but he still played one on TV. His image had more value than his real estate portfolio.
But the apartments and buildings where Trump held some degree of ownership could be turned into value again. All it took was partnering with foreign crime bosses looking for a place to stash their cash. To inflate the value of his portfolio, Trump had to do nothing other than look away as the dirty money poured in from one LLC to the next. Citizens in Russia, Kazakhstan, and other former Soviet states lost hundreds of millions, but Trump got a cut as looted funds flowed through offices and apartments in buildings that carried those critical gold letters.
Horton’s evaluation of this material in coordination with the declassified DNI report is that Trump actively worked with and for Russian interests.
What these exposes showed, is that Trump pursued the projects hand in glove with Russian mobsters who worked closely with Putin’s Kremlin ...
But based on the information in the Financial Times report, it appears that there are actually two possible answers. Trump may have been actively involved with and working for Russian sources. He might also have simply played the role of useful idiot, displaying his readiness to feign ignorance about any deal … so long as it generated some funds to float his sinking boat.
In the end, there’s not a lot of difference in the outcome. Trump got money. Oligarchs cleaned their cash. Russia got their man."

","My journalism career started in 2013, when I was 20 years old, with the press secretary for a New York City mayoral campaign calling me a “cunt”—on the record—to a national news outlet in response to one of my stories.
If I were easily offended, I would’ve stopped right after reading the resulting headlines. But as it turned out, I have a very high tolerance for the sort of colorful, mangled language critics often apply to reporters—in particular female reporters—they don’t like.
Still, I couldn’t have anticipated how much that episode would set the tone for the ensuing three years and the 2016 election.
On Labor Day morning just before 10 a.m., I posted a story on Facebook written by my colleague, Brandy Zadrozny, about Donald Trump’s second wife, Marla Maples. Zadrozny, I said, was the only person I knew more obsessed with Maples than me. I called it a “great” story.
A few minutes later I received a familiar notification: Mike Krawitz, a Republican candidate for the West Deptford, New Jersey, township committee, had left three comments on the post.
“Bill. Clinton. Cheated. On. Hillary. :). With. Multiple. Women,” he said.
“Fuck. You. Olivia, I. Hope. Somebody. Rapes. You. Today. :)
“Hope. You. Get. Raped. By. A. Syrian. Refugee. :)”
I should stop here to explain that my Facebook page is a cesspool of trolls and similar lifeforms who respond to everything I say with vitriol. I use Facebook as a means to share my stories, and so I keep it public, rarely posting things of a personal nature there.
The total shitshow this has produced has become something of a running joke among my friends, who will often jump into the comments to mock or bicker with the angry old men (it’s always men) sharing their crazy memes in response to my stories or announcements that I’ll be appearing on cable news.
In my two-plus years at The Daily Beast, I’ve mostly been assigned to cover Republican candidates, so the majority of feedback (read: hate mail) I get is from readers who sympathize with those candidates. Supporters of Rand Paul called me a “bimbo troll,” while defenders of a white supremacist running for office labeled me a “plastic surgery addict” and “probable jewess.”
Trump fans like Krawitz have their own vocabulary altogether, as a quick glance at my Twitter mentions will show you. It’s difficult for me to say what kind of reaction I would’ve received if I’d been writing about Democrats. For all the talk about Bernie Bros, I can only remember receiving one message from an aggrieved Sanders fan.
But a lack of decorum and blatant misogyny do appear to be pervasive on the far right. And the nomination of Trump, a candidate who mocked his female primary opponent’s face and suggested Megyn Kelly asked him hard questions because she had her period, suggests an institutionalization of the sentiment. At Trump rallies, after all, it’s not uncommon to see people hawking or wearing T-shirts that read “Trump That Bitch!”
Still, Krawitz was different.
In Democratic West Deptford, he’s a perennial candidate of little consequence. The local Republican Party describes him as a longtime resident and member of the community who “offer[s] a different perspective in [the] campaign.” What he does for a living, if anything, is unclear. In 2008, he made news when he impersonated Democratic Party boss George Norcross on the phone in order to get put through to then-governor Jon Corzine.
Now in his early forties, he’s pictured on Facebook appearing chubby in an ill-fitting suit, with a receding hairline that emphasizes his sweaty forehead. On his personal page (although I never accepted his friend request) he mostly posted photos of his hero, Donald J. Trump. But on my page, since December 2014, he diligently commented on the majority of posts with a curiously distinct grammar to convey increasingly angry sentiments.
“Olivia. You. Call. Yourself. A. Journalist. ?” he asked on Dec. 9, 2014, in response to my story about the impending collapse of the Trump Taj Mahal. “I. Invite. Olivia. To. Contact. Me. So. I. Can. Show. You. Around. The. Taj. Mahal. I’ll. Pay. For. Everything. Mike.” He left his phone number.
A year later, he was still at it. “Stupid Olivia. go back up Obamas. Ass. :)” he said on Dec. 11, 2015.
And on Aug. 10, 2016, he said, “How’s. The. Gun. Crime. In. Democrat. Chicago. Olivia. You. Ugly. Stupid. Cunt. :)”
Krawitz’s long history of posting grammatically unsound comments of this nature on my Facebook page makes it difficult to believe his claim, and the claim of the West Deptford Republican Party, that he was hacked on Monday.
Gloucester County Republican Executive Committee chair Jim Philbin distanced himself from Krawitz, whom he claimed he doesn’t know “personally” and called for his resignation in a press release on Tuesday. West Deptford’s voters, of course, were already unlikely to elect him before he added supporting the rape of female journalists to his campaign platform.
In an additional statement to The Daily Beast, the West Deptford Executive Board said, “We have been informed he is resigning.”
But the fate of political discourse in America is less certain.
News publications (including this one) have made a big show of eliminating comments sections in recent years, arguing, correctly, that they are little more than safe spaces for bullies. But increasingly, every other public forum is becoming like that, too.
And in the age of Trump, bullying has been rebranded as telling it like it is.
Using obscene or threatening language is a point of pride, proof that you’re beholden to nothing but the truth. And anyone who can’t handle that? Well, they’re just a politically correct loser.
When a former reality TV star can become the Republican nominee while offending and belittling entire genders, races, and religions, why wouldn’t a man seeking local office think that encouraging the rape of a woman he hates is OK?
Among people who exist publicly, like reporters do, “Don’t read the comments!” is a common refrain. It’s a suggestion that by ignoring the segment of the population who hide behind their computer screens and spout off, you can render them powerless.
At one point, that might’ve been true.
But it’s no longer a question of what the journalist—who chose a career that invites public criticism—can handle.
We are now existing in the post-shame era of American politics, where the comments have come alive—and they’re running for office."

","Shocking Study Released of Georgia State Republicans’ Years-Long Voter Disenfranchisement Scheme
The state of Georgia appears to have been quietly purging hundreds of thousands of valid registered voters from the state rolls for years, according to a study which began in 2013 and was conducted by the Los Angeles-based non-partisan Palast Investigative Fund.
“Given our findings of what appears to be large-scale disenfranchisement of legitimate voters, our foundation has chosen, in the public interest, to make our findings available to the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia for review in preparation for making our findings public. We have also created a website where Georgians may look up their names to check if they have been wrongly disenfranchised,” Greg Palast, the firm’s principal investigator, wrote to the ACLU on Monday.
“The report outlined three ways the state of Georgia verifies a person’s address: a form of the National Change of Address registry of the US Postal Service, returned mail, or failure to vote in two federal election cycles combined with a failure to return a postcard that is used to confirm an address,” CNN explained.
Georgia ACLU Executive Director Andrea Young spoke to CNN following the report’s release.
“On the one hand, I was deeply saddened and on the other side, not entirely surprised,” Young told CNN, adding that Georgia’s voter roll management system is still “prone to tremendous error.”
Young added that “the real takeaway from this is the state of Georgia is using a methodology for maintaining its voter rolls that is both more expensive and less accurate than what industry would use to maintain a high-quality mailing list.” The results, published on Monday, are astonishing. Of the more than 300,000 names that were purged from the rolls – nearly four percent of the total number of registered voters in the state – the study discovered that “198,351 Georgia voters who supposedly moved from their registration addresses who, in fact, have not moved at all, and therefore were wrongly purged, a 63.3% error rate.” This is a conservative estimate, however, because the report “left out of this list those voters whose addresses we were unable to confirm,” the The Palast Fund explains. Moreover, “the state provided many unreadable or unverified files,” the The Palast Fund points out. “As a result, we can only confirm that 65,411, or about one in three citizens, moved from their county of registration. Looking at the data another way: two out of three – 2/3 or 66% — of the state’s list remained at the address where they are registered.”
The findings were based on “over 240 data sources, in addition to our Postal Service licensee who accessed the deep history files of the Postal Service, a process required by the Post Office for commercial enterprises such as Amazon and Ebay.”
“This is the Palast team’s second review of the Georgia voter registration cancellation lists,” the report notes. “In 2018, we obtained a list of over half a million Georgians removed from the voter rolls by order of the Secretary of State in 2017. Again, we hired address list hygiene experts to analyze the list. We found and named 340,134 voters who had not moved from their registration address but, whom the Secretary of State nevertheless had canceled their voter registration based on erroneous information these citizens had moved their residence.”
More recent efforts by Kemp and state Republicans to disenfranchise voters – especially in communities of color and working class economic status in large cities – were no doubt amelioriated by the Supreme Court’s gutting of the Voting Rights Act in 2018.
“Under the recent June 2018 Husted decision, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed for using failure to vote as one piece of evidence that a voter has moved,” the report explains.
After Kemp was inaugurated in 2019, the new Georgia Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, “published a list of 313,243 citizens purged from the state’s voter rolls on grounds they had moved from their registration address,” the report states. Raffensberger claimed at the time that the names were removed because the voters were “inactive,” meaning they had not voted in recent elections.
“The ‘confirmation’ card [was] mailed to ‘inactive’ voters. However, this combination of non-voting and failure to return a postcard cannot be used if it is not ‘reasonable’ information,” Palast found in its investigation. “As the Georgia confirmation-by-postcard purge captures voters who did not move, Georgia’s method is, on its face, unreasonable.”
But because voting is not compulsory anywhere in the United States, citizens can abstain from voting without risking losing their rights. “The ‘Failure to Vote’ clause of the National Voter Registration Act explicitly prohibits using non-voting as a reason to cancel a citizen’s voter registration,” the report notes.
Put more simply, stripping people of their right to vote because they chose not to is unconstitutional.
These purges garnered national attention amid the ratf*ckery in Georgia’s 2018 gubernatorial race between then-Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp and former Democratic State Representative Stacey Abrams. As secretary of state, Kemp had unilateral power over how elections in the state were conducted.
Kemp’s narrow victory over Abrams is considered by many politicos as sketchy at best and and worst, illegitimate, and has prompted a litany of lawsuits.
Abrams did not challenge the results of the election and has become a leading voice in the national voting rights movement.
Georgia has since become a hotly contested swing state in the 2020 presidential election. In 2016, Republican Donald Trump carried Georgia’s 16 Electoral College votes by less than six points over Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Recent polling shows Trump in a virtual dead-heat with former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, with some surveys giving Biden an edge. The last Democratic presidential candidate to win Georgia was Bill Clinton in 1992.

","Five Washington, D.C., religious leaders and two retired or inactive D.C.-based judges have launched an effort designed to force President Trump to fully disengage from the Trump family business while serving in office.
And unlike other challenges, this one has a very narrow, precise, and attainable target: The Trump International Hotel D.C.’s liquor license, which Trump continues to hold personally, despite having purportedly stepped back from Trump Organization business dealings.
According to Joan Goldfrank, a retired magistrate judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia; Henry H. Kennedy, Jr., an inactive senior U.S. District Court judge for the District of Columbia; Rev. William Lamar IV, the senior pastor at the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C.; Rev. Jennifer Butler, the founding executive director of Faith in Public Life and the former chair of the White House Council on Faith and Neighborhood Partnerships; Rev. Dr. Timothy Tee Boddie, a Baptist preacher; Rabbi Jack Moline, a Conservative Jewish rabbi; and Rabbi Aaron Potek, an Orthodox Jewish rabbi, all residents of D.C., the Trump hotel’s liquor license should be revoked.
That is because Trump remains the owner of the licensee—the Trump International—and D.C. law requires an owner to be ""of good character.” The complainants argue that Trump having been accused of sexual assault by at least 16 women, his foundation continuing to be dogged by allegations of impropriety, his failure to pay contractors money owed, his maintenance of relationships with alleged criminals, and his attitudes toward minority groups and regarding race relations collectively mean he falls short of the legal “good character” standard.
“ But if the complaint does result in Trump’s license being yanked, the complainants expect to see it replicated elsewhere—and Trump should probably prepare for that. ”
If you think this sounds crazy, get this: The District of Columbia Alcohol Beverage Control Board just might wind up agreeing.
Former board member Mafara Hobson is siding with the complainants and urging “an immediate investigation and subsequent hearing to determine if the hotel is in compliance and worthy of the privilege to hold a liquor license in the nation’s capital.” That requested investigation is currently ongoing, meaning this isn’t just a random request filed and sitting in an inbox somewhere, gathering dust. Trump’s license could indeed be pulled, something that would no doubt irk him greatly, and cause major financial issues for the hotel.
Observers of the ongoing war between the president and his detractors might regard the complaint as the ultimate in clever trolling designed to mess with the president’s head—and the latter part of that statement may be true. Trump is famously boastful of his wealth and business success, despite four bankruptcies; alcohol sales form a solid financial foundation for hotels and restaurants. It’s easy to imagine that the loss of the liquor license could seriously damage the financial health of the Trump International, despite the hotel’s popularity with lobbyists, insiders and foreign governments trying to curry favor with the Trump administration. In turn, the hotel performing badly could further undermine perceptions of Trump as a successful businessman, which were to some degree already knocked back during the 2016 primary.
Joshua A. Levy, counsel to the complainants, says Trump need not jeopardize the financial well-being of the property, however, by allowing the complaint and investigation to proceed further. “Mr. Trump put his character at issue when he certified that he is the owner of the licensee,” says Levy. “If he doesn’t want to adjudicate his own character, he can transfer his ownership to someone who, as opposed to Mr. Trump, can meet the statutory requirements. Otherwise, he should have to show cause why his hotel should keep the license. Being president does not excuse Mr. Trump from compliance with the law.” In other words, to avoid the entire problem, Trump could simply make someone else—perhaps a less ethically encumbered family member or business associate—owner.
But if Trump is to retain his license, not only will he need to show evidence of “good character”—something Trump critics might wryly suggest he could do by leveraging his evangelical backers to try to make his case. Mr. Levy says the board itself will need to show cause why the Trump International’s liquor license should not be revoked, having regard to the “good character” requirement pertaining to the licensee’s owner. Otherwise put, the board will have to go to bat for Trump. That may be a tough sell in D.C., where Trump is wildly unpopular, having managed to win a mere 4 percent of the vote in 2016. Adding to the potential complexity facing Trump is the fact that members of the board are appointed by D.C.’s mayor and confirmed by D.C.’s council—all of whom can be lobbied. But lobbying the board itself is, according to a backer of the effort, not typically done.
Will the scheme work? Despite the fact that Trump is hardly a beloved figure in D.C., and it’s an arm of the D.C. local government that needs to make the decision, the board could of course decide to let him keep his license; that would signal business-friendliness that some have seen as waning in the district lately with voters having passed an initiative to raise the hourly wage of tipped workers.
But if the complaint does result in Trump’s license being yanked, the complainants expect to see it replicated elsewhere—and Trump should probably prepare for that. In the initial application filed to obtain the liquor license, Trump said he owned, controlled or “was associated” with 19 further businesses that held liquor licenses nationwide, including a bevy associated with his golf courses. Some of those are said to be in locations where standards meet or exceed those of D.C.’s “good character” requirement, potentially putting them at risk for the same sort of license-jeopardizing complaints.
While the D.C. complainants are not pursuing action with respect to these other liquor licenses, they believe their complaint may be replicated elsewhere, by other local community and judicial leaders who take issue with Trump’s apparent continued involvement in his family business, his character and ethics.
Of course, that is assuming the complaint actually succeeds in costing Trump his liquor license in D.C., or that he does not take note of the complaint and preemptively transfer the license to someone of more obviously “good character” in order to avoid the hassle.
The latter of those end results would of course be a good outcome in the view of the complainants. Per Mr. Levy, “The rule of law still matters. Character still matters.” #nevertrumpers and the #resistance may argue that’s a quaint notion that fell by the wayside with Trump’s inauguration as president. However, the D.C. liquor board might end up proving them wrong—at least in this single, very narrow, specific legal area."

","While he has been met with justifiable derision for the comparison (Christopher Ingraham walked through the math for us, pointing out that a year’s worth of health care would equal 23 iPhone 7 Pluses in price), Chaffetz was articulating a commonly held belief that poverty in the United States is, by and large, the result of laziness, immorality and irresponsibility. If only people made better choices — if they worked harder, stayed in school, got married, didn’t have children they couldn’t afford, spent what money they had more wisely and saved more — then they wouldn’t be poor, or so the reasoning goes.
Brian Fung explains why Jason Chaffetz said Americans should skip the new iPhone and ""invest in their own health care,"" and why the comparison is flawed. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)
This insistence that people would not be poor if only they would try harder defines the thinking behind the signature welfare restructuring law of the Clinton era, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. It’s the logic at the heart of efforts to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients, to drug-test people collecting unemployment insurance or to prevent food stamp recipients from buying steak and lobster.
Since the invention of the mythic welfare queen in the 1960s, this has been the story we most reliably tell about why people are poor. Never mind that research from across the social sciences shows us, over and again, that it’s a lie. Never mind low wages or lack of jobs, the poor quality of too many schools, the dearth of marriageable men in poor black communities (thanks to a racialized criminal justice system and ongoing discrimination in the labor market) or the high cost of birth control and day care. Never mind the fact that the largest group of poor people in the United States are children. Never mind the grim reality that most American adults who are poor are not poor from lack of effort but despite it.

This deep denial serves a few functions, however.
First, it’s founded on the assumption that the United States is a land of opportunity, where upward mobility is readily available and hard work gets you ahead. We’ve recently taken to calling it grit. While grit may have ushered you up the socioeconomic ladder in the late 19th century, it’s no longer up to the task today. Rates of intergenerational income mobility are, in fact, higher in France, Spain, Germany, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and other countries in the world than they are here in the United States. And that mobility is in further decline here, an indicator of the falling fortunes not just of poor and low-income Americans, but of middle-class ones, too.
After House Republicans release a proposal to alter the Affordable Care Act, members of their party offer a mixture of support and suggestions for the plan (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)
To accept this as reality is to confront the unpleasant fact that myths of American exceptionalism are just that — myths — and many of us would fare better economically (and live longer, healthier lives, too) had we been born elsewhere. That cognitive dissonance is too much for too many of us, so we believe instead that people can overcome any obstacle if they would simply work hard enough.
Second, to believe that poverty is a result of immorality or irresponsibility helps people believe it can’t happen to them. But it can happen to them (and to me and to you). Poverty in the United States is common, and according to the Census Bureau, over a three-year period, about one-third of all U.S. residents slip below the poverty line at least once for two months or more.

Third — and conveniently, perhaps, for people like Chaffetz or House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) — this stubborn insistence that people could have more money or more health care if only they wanted them more absolves the government of having to intervene and use its power on their behalf. In this way of thinking, reducing access to subsidized health insurance isn’t cruel; it’s responsible, a form of tough love in which people are forced to make good choices instead of bad ones. This is both patronizing and, of course, a gross misreading of the actual outcome of laws like these.
There’s one final problem with these kinds of arguments, and that is the implication that we should be worried by the possibility of poor people buying the occasional steak, lottery ticket or, yes, even an iPhone. Set aside the fact that a better cut of meat may be more nutritious than a meal Chaffetz would approve of, or the fact that a smartphone may be your only access to email, job notices, benefit applications, school work and so on. Why do we begrudge people struggling to get by the occasional indulgence? Why do we so little value pleasure and joy? Why do we insist that if you are poor, you should also be miserable? Why do we require penitence?"

He’s a damn Bush, people. What the hell did you expect?
If you didn’t want someone acting like a damn Bush, why the fool tarnation did you elect a damn Bush?
Personnel records show that Bush has directed at least 40 external hires between November 2014 and July 2015 but listed only four of those with the Workforce Commission. The average salary for those four jobs was about $65,000. The average salary for the 36 jobs that were not posted was about $90,000. Ten jobs went to campaign aides, including temporary transition director, Trey Newton, who made $17,500 per month, and the five regional outreach coordinators, who are making annual salaries of $55,000. Newton, the campaign engineer Bush once called “our Karl Rove,” left in January. He did not return a call seeking comment.
And it gets worse. His college friends and GOP donors with no management experience get triple digit salaries. Because he’s a Bush.
Last week I complained that he’s never at work because he’s out campaigning for his Dad. I guess I should have kept my mouth shut.

","In the two weeks since George Floyd died after a Minneapolis police officer put his knee on his neck for almost nine minutes, many of the people protesting systemic racial injustice and police brutality across the country have called to “defund the police” as a possible solution.
While both President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden argued against defunding the police on Monday, some lawmakers and political leaders are considering the controversial measure. Minneapolis City Council members vowed to “dismantle” the local police department on Saturday, in order to “recreate systems that actually keep us safe.” New York City mayor Bill de Blasio pledged on Sunday to cut some money from the NYPD’s $6 billion budget, and redistribute funds to youth services and social services. Details will be hammered out over the next three weeks ahead of the city’s July 1 budget deadline.
But critics such as Fox News host Tucker Carlson have reacted with alarm, saying that cutting police department budgets across the country would mean “thugs are in charge.” White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that “the President is appalled by the ‘defund the police’ movement.” And his presumptive Democratic rival for the Oval Office also “does not believe that police should be defunded,” according to a statement released by Biden’s communications director. The president also tweeted against the idea on Monday, adding, “The Radical Left Democrats have gone crazy!”
And there appears to be a lot of confusion over what purpose taking funds away from local law enforcement agencies serves. “Defund the police. No more cops. That’s what they’re fighting for,” Carlson also said on his show recently.
So John Oliver devoted his entire Sunday night episode of “Last Week Tonight” on HBO T, +2.42% to talking about the police, noting that the disturbing images of police brutality, and incidents of peaceful protests devolving into violence, are just “the tip of a very large iceberg.”
He continued, “It didn’t start this week, or with this president, and always disproportionately falls on black communities.” And Oliver addressed three key questions: How things got to this point; what the obstacles to reform have been; and what to do going forward.
“ “All the while, as we were continuing to boost funding for police and give them more authority, we were simultaneously slashing spending on key social services.” ”
He outlined law enforcement’s history of enforcing laws “explicitly designed to subjugate black people,” beginning with capturing escaped slaves, as well as the Jim Crow laws that enforced segregation after Emancipation, leading up to the War on Drugs, “broken windows” policing and “stop-and-frisk” policies that disproportionately targeted people of color. Oliver also noted that Democrats including former President Bill Clinton — whose 1993 new cops plan used federal money to pay for 100,000 new police officers — were involved in this.
“All the while, as we were continuing to boost funding for police and give them more authority, we were simultaneously slashing spending on key social services,” Oliver said. “That meant that in many communities, the police were the only ones left to handle almost any issue that people had, which is a real problem … we are asking police to do far too much.”
Oliver argued that taking some money from a police department’s budget, and using it to create more affordable housing, or to fund mental health services, would create a community safety net better suited to respond to situations such as someone having a mental health crisis in public, rather than an armed officer. The police could then focus on more serious crimes.
“The concept is that the role of the police can then significantly shrink because they are not responding to the homeless, or to mental health calls, or arresting children in schools, or really any other situation where the best solution is not someone showing up with a gun,” Oliver said. “That is the idea behind ‘defund the police,’ if you actually listen to it.”
“ “Defunding the police absolutely does not mean that we eliminate all cops and just succumb to ‘The Purge.’ Instead, it’s about moving away from a narrow conception of public safety that relies on policing and punishment, and investing in a community’s actual safety net. Things like stable housing, mental health services and community organizations.” ”
It’s a distinction that Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) made on “The View” on Monday, after co-host Meghan McCain repeatedly asked Harris whether “you support defunding and removing the police from American communities, and if not, why do you think there is such a hard time being differentiated right now between defunding and reforming police departments?”
Harris avoided giving a “yes or no” answer. “We have confused the idea that to achieve safety, you put more cops on the street,” she said, “instead of understanding to achieve safe and healthy communities, you put more resources into the public education system of those communities, into affordable housing, into home ownership, into access to capital for small businesses, access to health care regardless of how much money people have. That’s how you achieve safe and healthy communities.”
When McCain pressed again, saying she wanted a “yes or no” response, Harris asked her to explain what she thought “defunding the police” means. “I assume it’s removing police,” McCain said — to which her cohost Sunny Hostin countered, “Defunding the police doesn’t mean abolishing the police. It means taking some of those funds that are typically one-third of the budget of a city and giving some of those funds to services like education and mental health resources.”
Oliver also dispelled the idea these episodes of police brutality are an issue of “a few bad actors,” stating, “This clearly isn’t about individual officers. It’s about a structure built on systemic racism that this country created intentionally, and now needs to be dismantled intentionally and replaced with one that takes into account the needs of the people that it actually serves.”
His argument went viral on Twitter TWTR, +0.30% overnight Sunday into Monday.
“Black communities have had to be perpetual activists while also routinely being disenfranchised, and it is long past time that the rest of us joined to make sure that their voices are heard and acted upon,” he added. “Because it’s gonna be far too easy for nothing to meaningfully change here. That is what has always happened before.”
Watch it here. The segment on defunding police begins roughly 25 minutes in.
As for the presidential candidates’ responses to the issue, the White House press secretary said that Trump is ""talking through a number of proposals; no announcements on that. But he definitely, as he’s noted, recognizes the horrid injustice done to George Floyd, and is taking a look at various proposals.”
Biden’s spokesperson Andrew Bates released a statement explaining that while Biden “hears and shares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change,” he does not believe police should be defunded. He supports reform such as “funding for public schools, summer programs, mental health and substance abuse treatment separate from funding for policing — so that officers can focus on the job of policing.”

","I'm running in the third congressional district in Utah in the seat that has been occupied by Jason Chaffetz. I think that the value of a family physician in government is not only do we have the science background to analyze and we're able to take complex data and explain it in simple terms, but my 30 years as a primary care physician gives me the perspective of compassion because I've worked with people as patients who had no insurance, no resources, who had to make tough decisions about whether to seek healthcare or feed their families.
I'm running because I think those kinds of issues need to be addressed in a scientific and compassionate manner. Chaffetz announced he would not run at 2018 and throughout this training, I have to admit I became distracted during the afternoon because rumors were flying that he was not only not going to run but he was going to resign soon. This all happened really as I was being dropped off at the curb for this trip to Washington, DC. So at this point in the week, I have a lot of questions. But I will say my message to our constituents has not changed. The desire to bring ethics and integrity back to Washington and to apply the skills.

","Rather than building new homes to help satisfy housing markets, this fascinating new study says that taxing empty homes in developed cities could increase housing affordability for local residents while simultaneously generating income for municipal governments.
Over the course of the last 20 years, housing affordability has decreased substantially in the UK due to a rapid increase in prices relative to earnings. This may be partially due to foreign investors buying out properties in cities such as London, or from British citizens in rural areas buying out second homes in the city, which reduces the availability of affordable housing for local residents.
This means that local citizens who actually live in the city are forced to pay more money for housing in neighborhoods that are filled with homes that are unoccupied for more than half of the year.
In a study that was published last week in the journal Palgrave Communications, researcher Jonathan Bourne at University College London investigated the relationship between the amount of properties which do not have permanent residents (low-use properties), and housing affordability in different parts of England and Wales.

Upon researching the data, which represents about 40% of the population, the researcher was stunned to find that there were over 340,000 low-use properties across the regions.
Analysis revealed that low-use properties were worth £363,000 on average, which is 18.5% more expensive than the average home (£306,000). This was the case for the majority of properties included in the dataset.
“One of the goals of this research was to get an idea of the fraction of the population of England and Wales living in areas where low-use properties are more expensive than homes occupied by full-time residents, which suggests that the most desirable properties are being bought for purposes other than use as a home, for example as investment opportunities or holiday homes,” Bourne explained.
“Some of the most surprising findings were the sheer value and quantity of low-use properties in some areas, amounting to £21 billion in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea alone, and £123 billion in the entire dataset. We estimate that in England and Wales, 39-47% of the population lives in areas where low-use properties are more expensive than permanently-occupied homes.”

Though some municipalities are trying to meet housing demands by building more housing, Bourne suggests that local governments implement an empty homes tax of 1% instead.
“The data shows that low-use properties are very concentrated in small numbers of desirable areas. In such cases simply building more homes is not going to solve the problem, as the issue is intense competition for property, not a lack of places to live,” says Bourne.
“An empty homes tax may be more effective, with the potential to generate a not inconsiderable income for local authorities, whilst taxing people who are typically not eligible to vote in local elections, or encouraging them to rent out their properties.”
Based on these findings and the current council tax base, the author suggests that an empty homes tax of 1% would raise an additional £1.2 billion in taxes, which is equivalent to 11% of the council tax currently collected in the areas included in the dataset.

Vancouver implemented a similar empty home tax in 2017, which was the first of its kind in North America. One year after it went into effect, the city reported a 15% decrease in unoccupied homes, which amounted to 163 properties being rented out to local tenants.
Furthermore, the tax raised more than $38 million in city revenue, all of which was spent on affordable housing programs.
Bourne cautions that the UK empty homes tax would not be evenly distributed due to varying concentrations of low-use properties, but his findings could help to make housing more affordable in cities around the world.

","Yesterday, there was a brief internet kerfuffle when it was revealed that Elon Musk donated nearly $40,000 to the Protect the House PAC, a Republican organization meant to keep Republican butts in Congressional seats come this fall’s midterm elections. While Musk defended himself on Twitter by pointing out that he donates much more than $40,000 to the Sierra Club and claiming the purpose of the donation was to maintain “open dialogue,” it doesn’t seem unreasonable to point out that Musk has an economic incentive to cozy up to the G.O.P. — after all, the Republican party would much rather outsource the work of NASA to private space companies, and, well, Elon Musk owns a private space company.
But to focus solely on Musk’s political contributions is to ignore the greater reality of the situation, which is that no matter how you slice it, tech companies are businesses, and Republican politicians are unashamedly pro-business (unlike Democratic politicians, who are more prone to being ashamedly pro-business). It goes to reason, then, that lots of people in tech, not just Elon Musk, are probably donating to Republicans.
Take, oh, say... Facebook.
Below, you can see a list of contributions above $5,000 given by Facebook Inc.’s Political Action Committee during this current election cycle. While Facebook’s largest donation was $25,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as well as another $10,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, it gave $10,000 each to those committees’ analogues on the Republican side of the aisle."

","When a president visits a disaster zone, three things normally happen: He thanks emergency responders for their work, offers words of comfort to victims, and promises to commit all federal resources available.
When Trump visited Puerto Rico Tuesday, two weeks after Hurricane Maria devastated the island, he had few words of support for the 3.4 million Americans who live on the island.
Instead, Trump spent a lot of time downplaying the severity of the storm and complained about how much money the US government is spending to help.
""I hate to say it, Puerto Rico, you've thrown our budget out of whack,"" he said during a briefing with local and federal responders. ""We've spent a lot of money in Puerto Rico.""
A spokesperson for FEMA told me Tuesday that the agency had approved $35 million in public and individual assistance grants for the island. Meanwhile, FEMA has approved $691 million in grants to Irma victims in Florida and has sent $323 million to Texas communities recovering from Harvey.
Public and individual assistance figures don't capture all the federal money spent responding to a disaster, but they do give a good picture of recovery costs to date.
In hounding Puerto Rico about money, President Trump was trying to make a larger point. He was telling Puerto Ricans that they should be grateful for whatever help they end up getting from Washington, DC. Trump is framing the US response in Puerto Rico as an act of charity and goodwill.
What the president may not realize is that Puerto Rico funds the US government. Puerto Ricans who live on the island aren’t just American citizens — they’re American taxpayers. They pay payroll taxes, business taxes, and estate taxes. They helped pay for disaster relief in Texas after Hurricane Harvey and in Florida after Hurricane Irma.
Now they are entitled to the same response and financial help that the federal government extended to those states. This is not a matter of charity or goodwill. It’s how the federal government is supposed to work.
Puerto Rico pays billions of federal taxes each year
Puerto Rico is a US territory and not a state, so its residents don’t pay federal income tax unless they work for the US government. Even so, workers there pay the majority of federal taxes that Americans on the mainland pay — payroll taxes, social security taxes, business taxes, gift taxes, estate taxes and so on.
The recent economic crisis on the island has put a huge dent in the federal tax revenue collected from Puerto Rico, but it still added up to $3.6 billion in fiscal year 2016. That’s not much less than some states where residents do pay income tax: Vermont and Wyoming paid $4.5 billion in federal taxes that year.
Even during the island's worst financial crisis, Puerto Rico is still directly funding the US government, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is spending millions of dollars to rebuild damaged infrastructure in Houston after Hurricane Harvey.
In Texas, FEMA has provided $323 million worth of public assistance grants and has authorized both short-term emergency help and long-term rebuilding costs. It only took one week for Trump to ask Congress for extra relief money to help Texas rebuild critical infrastructure and to provide residents and businesses with low-interest recovery loans.
So far, Trump has only authorized the basic response for short-term emergency help in Puerto Rico, even though the island needs extensive work on infrastructure.
Meanwhile, the White House is in no hurry to ask Congress to draft a relief package for Puerto Rico. Instead, the president keeps implying that he doesn't know how the massive rebuilding effort will be funded. Instead of assuring Puerto Rico that the government will pay for the same type of rebuilding efforts happening in Texas, though, President Trump is essentially telling the island not to expect too much.
...The fact is that Puerto Rico has been destroyed by two hurricanes. Big decisions will have to be made as to the cost of its rebuilding! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 29, 2017
Disaster relief isn’t based on a state’s financial health
There are no official estimates out yet on the cost of the hurricane damage to Puerto Rico, but just fixing the electrical system will cost billions of dollars, a Department of Energy responder told me. Then there's the cost of rebuilding hospitals, water pumping stations, and other critical infrastructure.
It's true that the government of Puerto Rico is bankrupt, and, as President Trump likes to point out, partially to blame for its own fiscal mess. And measured on a per capita basis, Puerto Ricans pay fewer taxes per capita than residents of any of the 50 states.
But that is irrelevant. The federal government doesn't operate business transactions with each state, giving the best services to the states that pay the most taxes. That's not how the government works.
The Stafford Act, which governs federal response to major disasters, says the government must provide help to Puerto Rico like it would to any other state. It doesn’t say that help should be based on the state’s financial health. If it did, that would mean the government should give less help to Illinois after a disaster because the state is nearly bankrupt.
Nor does it say disaster relief depends on how much it puts the budget “out of whack,” in Trump’s words. After all, the majority of states get more back from the federal government than they pay in taxes. One of them is Louisiana, where the federal government spent $9.9 billion rebuilding after Katrina. Nobody complained about the cost. In fact, President George W. Bush was criticized for not doing more for Katrina victims."

","Monday, the Congressional Budget Office released an estimate of a prescription drug bill proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders that said it would save Americans $7 billion over 10 years. File Photo by Mike Theiler/UPI | License Photo
Aug. 1 (UPI) -- A Congressional Budget Office analysis estimates that a bill proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders that would allow Americans to buy prescription drugs from Canada and other countries would save taxpayers nearly $7 billion over the next 10 years.
The Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act was introduced by Sanders, I-Vt., Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., in February. According to the CBO estimate, the bill would gradually result in $6.8 billion in savings by 2027 through ""expanding the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory authority surrounding importation of prescription drugs"" and allowing ""pharmacies, wholesalers and individuals (for personal use) to import prescription drugs into the United States under certain new conditions from selected countries.""

In a statement announcing the bill's introduction, Sanders said that prescription drugs made by the same companies in the same factories are available in other countries for less than the price they're sold for in the United States.
""In 2014, Americans spent $1,112 per person on prescription drugs while Canadians spent $772 and Danes spent $325,"" Sanders said.
The bill currently has 21 co-sponsors, including 20 Democrats and Sen. Angus King, an Independent from Maine.
Despite potential cost savings, the International Business Times points out that the bill could face opposition from pharmaceutical industry lobbyists, who have ramped up efforts to stymie efforts by lawmakers to reduce drug costs.
During the first quarter of 2017, the pharmaceutical and health industry spent $78 million to lobby lawmakers in Washington, D.C., a 14 percent increase from the previous year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. So far this year, the pharmaceutical and health industry has spent $144,400,614 in lobbying, according to the latest figures from the CRP, which is about on pace with 2016, a presidential election year.
The biggest spender in the pharmaceutical industry has been the Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America, a trade group representing drug companies. The group has already spent more than $14 million in 2017, compared to $19.7 million during the entirety of 2016.
To make sure it had enough for its lobbying campaign this year, PRMA increased membership dues by 50 percent, generating an extra $100 million for advertising and lobbying purposes, reported The New York Times."

","President Donald Trump's controversial nomination for a lifetime seat on the United States Supreme Court could end the political career of Maine's Republican senator, Susan Collins.
Collins, who has branded herself as pro-choice, has been heavily criticized for backing the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the high court.
Bestselling author Stephen King, who lives in Maine, slammed the conservative lawmaker for supporting President Donald Trump's nominee.
""If Susan Collins votes to confirm Kavanaugh, and if she runs for re-election -- two bigs ifs -- she will be defeated,"" King tweeted on Saturday.
""It would be unwise for anyone to mistake how angry most Americans are at the way this is being railroaded through,"" he added.

Why is anyone surprised?
Donald Trump finished one last bit of work as he left for a Mar-a-Lago Thanksgiving, effectively endorsing disgraced former judge Roy Moore, the Alabama GOP Senate nominee, because “we don’t need a liberal person in there, a Democrat.” Trump continued attacking Democrat Doug Jones: “I’ve looked at his record. It’s terrible on crime. It’s terrible on the border. It’s terrible on the military.”
But Jones isn’t “terrible on crime.” The former US Attorney successfully prosecuted two of the men accused of the Birmingham church bombing that killed four little black girls in September 1963. It must also be observed: Moore himself is credibly accused of committing a crime, when he brought 14-year-old Leigh Corfman to his home and sexually molested her. It seems as though Corfman refused to consent to Moore’s pushing the boundaries, but it doesn’t matter: She was 14, too young to consent. Roy Moore is an accused child molester. Trump endorsed him nonetheless.
There had been some drama over whether Trump would do that. But in some ways, it’s like dog biting man, predictable. Trump, accused of sexual abuse by 16 women and elected president anyway, endorsed a far-right Republican who’s been accused by nine women. Of course he did. Both men deny the charges against them. Trump never accepted the increasingly common belief that we need to at least listen to these women. He depicted his accusers as crazy, or too ugly for him to have assaulted; he threatened to sue them (and of course he did not). If he came out and said he “believed” Moore’s nine accusers, he’d be opening himself to questions about how all 16 of his own accusers could be lying. Related Article The Best Way for Democrats to Show Their Disgust With Roy Moore Is by Going All-In for Doug Jones John Nichols
Also, he has no conscience.
In a typically herky-jerky joust with the media, Trump said he does not believe the women who’ve come forward to say Moore preyed on them as teenagers (or the police and retail and security workers who said Moore was banned at the local mall for hitting on high-school girls). “If you look at what is really going on, and you look at all the things that have happened over the last 48 hours, he totally denies it,” Trump said. “He says it didn’t happen. You have to listen to him also.”
There’s a new GOP slogan: “Listen to the predators.” Current Issue View our current issue
He continued: “I do have to say, 40 years is a long time,” Trump said of charges that go back to the ’70s. “He has run eight races, and this has never come up.”
Trump then wandered off message. “Women are very special,” he said. “I think it’s a very special time, a lot of things are coming out, and I think that’s good for our society and I think it’s very very good for women, and I’m very happy these things are coming out.”
So Trump is “very happy these things are coming out,” but doesn’t believe them? He’s not just a serial sexual offender, he’s a moron.
Trump’s endorsement of Moore was foreshadowed by his aide Kellyanne Conway’s comments on Monday to Fox and Friends. Conway seemed to shock the Fox hosts when she said, “Doug Jones in Alabama—folks, don’t be fooled. He will be a vote against tax cuts.”
Brian Kilmeade asked whether that represented a White House endorsement of Moore, Conway replied, “I’m telling you that we want the votes in the Senate to get this tax bill through.” Conway’s not-so-subtle message was: Yes, we’ll elect an accused child molester to get our tax bill. When your crass partisanship shocks Fox hosts, you know you’ve gone off the rails.
Trump’s Moore endorsement puts him at odds with major figures in his own party, from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to Alabama’s senior senator, Republican Richard Shelby, who says he “absolutely will not vote for Roy Moore.” Shelby’s comments are featured in a new Doug Jones ad, along with criticism by the president’s daughter Ivanka. Trump has made sure that the Moore election is a referendum on his control of the party. Having been cajoled into endorsing McConnell’s choice in the primary, appointed incumbent Luther Strange, an angry Trump followed former strategist Steve Bannon into the Moore camp, not wanting to be on the losing side again.
Will he wind up on the losing side anyway? Nobody knows. There are some polls showing Jones with a slight edge; there are Republicans like former Jeb Bush adviser Tim Miller endorsing Jones, and urging other Republicans to join him in raising money for the Democrat. Formerly mainstream Republicans seem to be seeing Moore as the existential threat they feared Donald Trump was, but that most convinced themselves he was not. Had these folks urged GOP votes for Hillary Clinton last year, his party might not be staring down the threat of a child-molesting white supremacist grabbing a seat in the Senate.
But hindsight is always easier. We’ll see whether in the coming days more Republicans join Miller and endorse Jones outright, or decide that tax cuts for the rich are more important than keeping a sexual abuser out of the Senate."

","President-elect Donald Trump has got his Twitter back. After meeting with President Obama at the White House yesterday, Trump fired off a couple of tweets, including one complaining about ""professional protestors"" who he claims have been ""incited by the media."" ""Very unfair!"" was the initial verdict, although a later tweet praised the protestors' ""passion for our great country.""
Trump's judgement on the protests (which are set to continue tonight) seems typically hypocritical considering his reaction to Obama's reelection in 2012. On November 7th that year, Trump tweeted that US citizens should ""march on Washington and stop this travesty,"" and that the country needed to ""fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice.""
Here's Trump in 2012:
We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2012
And here he is in 2016:
Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016
In one tweet that was recently deleted (but can be seen here and here), Trump even called for revolution, saying of Obama: ""He lost the popular vote by a lot and won the election. We should have a revolution in this country!"" He blamed America's ""phoney"" electoral college system for the result, despite the fact Obama did not actually lose the popular vote — he beat Republican candidate Mitt Romney by 5 million votes.
Of course, the (imaginary) state of affairs Trump railed against as undemocratic in 2012, has won him the presidency in 2016. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a relatively small margin — some 400,000 votes — but lost the election thanks to the electoral college.
Watch: It’s on America’s institutions to check Trump"
progressive,"http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/27/nicholas-kristof/more-americans-killed-guns-1968-all-wars-says-colu/
","In a column published shortly after the on-air slayings of two TV journalists in southwestern Virginia, the New York Times’ Nicholas Kristof offered some ""data points"" about the pervasiveness of gun violence in the United States.
One of them was: ""More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in American history.""
That sounded familiar. Really familiar. As it turns out, the web version of Kristof’s column sourced a PolitiFact article from Jan. 18, 2013, that fact-checked commentator Mark Shields’ claim that since 1968, ""more Americans have died from gunfire than died in … all the wars of this country's history."" (Shields used the year 1968 because it was the year presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated by gunman Sirhan Sirhan.)
We rated the claim True.
Two and a half years later, we wondered whether the statistic still held up, so we took a new look at the data.
Deaths from warfare
We found a comprehensive study of war-related deaths published by the Congressional Research Service on Feb. 26, 2010, and we supplemented that with data for up-to-date deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan using the website icasualties.org. Where possible, we’ve used the broadest definition of ""death"" — that is, all war-related deaths, not just those that occurred in combat.
The one change we’ve made since our initial fact-check is to revise upward the number of Civil War deaths. As several readers pointed out after we published our earlier fact-check, the CRS report cited 525,000 Union and Confederate dead, but a subsequent study revised that estimate upward to 750,000. The study’s author acknowledged a great deal of uncertainty about the proper figure, and some experts later questioned whether it’s wise to include so many deaths from disease — perhaps two-thirds of the 750,000 figure — since disease in an era of relatively primitive medicine was so widespread that it’s unclear what share of fatal disease during that period was really a result of the war.
Still, we’ll err on the side of the higher estimate and use the 750,000 figure this time.
Here’s a summary of deaths by major conflict:
War Deaths Revolutionary War 4,435 War of 1812 2,260 Mexican War 13,283 Civil War (Union and Confederate, estimate) 750,000 Spanish-American War 2,446 World War I 116,516 World War II 405,399 Korean War 36,574 Vietnam War 58,220 Persian Gulf War 383 Featured Fact-check “Only one person died on that day” during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot. Afghanistan War 2,363 Iraq War 4,492 Other wars (includes Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, Somalia and Haiti) 362 TOTAL 1,396,733
Gunfire deaths
As we did in our previous fact-check, we used a conservative estimate of data from a 1994 paper published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to count gun-related deaths from 1968 to 1980. For 1981 through 2013, we used annual data sets from CDC. Finally, for 2014 and the first eight months of 2015, we estimated that the number of gun-related deaths were equal to the rate during the previous three full years for which we have data — 2011 to 2013.
Here is a summary. The figures below refer to total deaths caused by firearms:
So the statistic still holds up: There have been 1,516,863 gun-related deaths since 1968, compared to 1,396,733 cumulative war deaths since the American Revolution. That’s 120,130 more gun deaths than war deaths -- about 9 percent more, or nearly four typical years worth of gun deaths. And that’s using the most generous scholarly estimate of Civil War deaths, the biggest component of American war deaths.
We’ll offer some added thoughts for context.
These figures refer to all gunfire-related deaths, not just homicides. In fact, homicides represent a minority of gun deaths, with suicides comprising the biggest share. In 2013, according to CDC data, 63 percent of gun-related deaths were from suicides, 33 percent were from homicides, and roughly 1 percent each were from accidents, legal interventions and undetermined causes.
There’s a risk in using a statistic like this to decry mass homicides carried out with guns. Using total firearm-related deaths makes the case against guns more dramatic than just using homicides alone.
However, in our view, Kristof framed this comparison with care. He mentioned suicides not once but three times in his column, and he referred broadly to the ""unrelenting toll of gun violence,"" not specifically to the toll of gun homicides. Indeed, at one point, Kristof specifically referenced the impact that stricter gun laws can have on gun suicides, writing that in 1996, after a mass shooting in Australia, lawmakers tightened gun laws. ""The firearm suicide rate dropped by half in Australia over the next seven years, and the firearm homicide rate was almost halved,"" according to data published in the Journal of Public Health Policy, Kristof wrote.
Finally, we’ll note that Kristof’s wording differed ever so slightly from the claim by Shields that we checked previously. While Shields said that ""more Americans have died from gunfire,"" Kristof wrote that ""more Americans have died from guns."" Some may argue that guns don’t kill people, people do. However, that’s a philosophical judgment and beyond our ability to fact-check. Here, we’ll stick to the numbers, and we find they’re on Kristof’s side.
Our ruling
Kristof wrote, ""More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in American history.""
Even using a significantly higher estimate for Civil War deaths than we did the last time we fact-checked this claim, the comparison still holds up. The number of gun deaths since 1968 — including, as Kristof was careful to note, both homicides and suicides — was higher than war fatalities by roughly 120,000 deaths, or almost four years’ worth of gun deaths in the United States. We rate the claim True."

","By now, the whole country knows what a godawful mess Governor Sam Brownback has made out of the state of Kansas in his doomed experiment to prove that modern conservative economics make sense. (Pro tip: They don’t.) Brownback, of course, would rather that not have gotten out to the world at large, and he and his government have done their level best to make sure it didn’t, as The Kansas City Star tells us.
A Kansas spokesperson was acknowledging that the state highway department didn’t have the money to rebuild a dangerous stretch of Interstate 70 that had been the scene of multiple wrecks and a grisly motorcycle fatality caught on video. “KDOT has lost a lot of money over the last few years,” the spokesperson said. “There’s just no funding at this point.” Simple, yes. But in Gov. Sam Brownback’s cash-strapped administration, those were fighting words. Days later, the spokesperson was fired. “Your article was the nail in my coffin for being the face of KDOT,” the spokesperson said in an email to The Kansas City Star.
One might conclude from this that Brownback would rather have people die on his state’s highways than admit, in the words of Marshall McLuhan in Annie Hall, that his entire fallacy is wrong. One might do that, indeed.
The Star’s investigation was six-months long, and it touches upon every aspect of the state government. You can decide for yourselves what findings are the most grotesque.
▪ Children known to the state’s Department for Children and Families suffer horrific abuse, while the agency cloaks its involvement with their cases, even shredding notes after meetings where children’s deaths are discussed, according to a former high-ranking DCF official. One grieving father told The Star he was pressured to sign a “gag order” days after his son was killed that would prevent him from discussing DCF’s role in the case. Even lawmakers trying to fix the troubled system say they cannot trust information coming from agency officials
▪ In the past decade, more than 90 percent of the laws passed by the Kansas Legislature have come from anonymous authors. Kansans often had no way of knowing who was pushing which legislation and why, and the topics have included abortion, concealed weapons and school funding. Kansas is one of only a few states that allow the practice.
▪ When Kansas police shoot and kill someone, law enforcement agencies often escape scrutiny because they are allowed to provide scant details to the public. The release of body-cam video has become common practice around the country after several high-profile, police-involved shootings. But in Kansas, a new state law is one of the most restrictive in the nation, allowing agencies to shelve footage that could shed more light on controversial cases.
▪ Kansas became the first state to fully privatize Medicaid services in 2013, and now some caregivers for people with disabilities say they have been asked to sign off on blank treatment plans — without knowing what’s being provided. In some of those cases, caregivers later discovered their services had been dramatically cut.
Me? I’ll go for forcing a non-disclosure agreement on a grieving parent and/or caregivers being asked to sign blank treatment plans.
The series in the Star is worth reading in full, because what happened in Kansas is precisely what the Republican Party has in mind for the country. This will necessarily including burying the evidence the way Brownback and his government have in Kansas. What happened there was a pure experiment in the supply-side, laissez-faire economics that are the primary foundation of respectable conservative crazy. They don’t work. They never will work. Their impact on the lives of ordinary people is inevitably and profoundly destructive.
Sam Brownback is a devout Catholic, you know. The president has nominated him to be some sort of half-assed ambassador for religious liberty. The Democrats in the Congress have slow-walked this nomination, and various wingnut word mills are getting antsy about it.
Even Brownback's fans should think twice about taking a midnight drive down that stretch of I-70.

","Tea Party leader and former Trump campaign chair Tim Nolan has pleaded guilty and received 20 years in prison for human trafficking, reports Cincinnati.com.
According to the report, Nolan, 71, a former judge, used drugs and threats of arrest to force women and girls under the age of 18 into sex acts.
Pleading guilty to 21 of the counts filed against him -- for crimes committed dating back to 2004 -- Nolan accepted a plea deal where he will serve 20 years in prison and pay a $100,000 fine, becoming eligible for parole in four years, his attorney stated.
Some of the incidents occurred in the summer of 2016 while Judge Nolan was serving as the chair of the Donald Trump campaign in Campbell County, KY.
Nolan served as a district judge in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and had just been elected to the Campbell County School Board in 2016 prior to being indicted.
According to a report read by Judge Kathleen Lape, Nolan paid some victims with heroin and painkillers in exchange for sex and threatened at least one victim, who lived on his property in southern Campbell County, with eviction unless she performed sex acts on him. Additionally Nolan told some of his victims -- some under the age of 18 -- that he would turn them into to the FBI if they didn't comply with his demands.
Nolan faced more than 100 years in prison on 28 felony charges, including four counts of human trafficking of a minor."

","One thing that sets Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders apart from opponent Hillary Clinton is that he opposed a 1996 law known widely as welfare reform.
The Vermont senator said the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which both Democratic President Bill Clinton and a bipartisan Congress supported, contributed to poverty today.
""What welfare reform did, in my view, was go after some of the weakest and most vulnerable people in this country,"" Sanders said at a Feb. 24 press conference in South Carolina. ""During that time, I spoke out against so-called welfare reform because I thought it was scapegoating people who were helpless, people who were very, very vulnerable. Secretary Clinton at that time had a very different position on welfare reform. ... Now what happened as a result of that so-called welfare reform bill? Since legislation was signed into law, the number of families living in extreme poverty has more than doubled from 636,000 to 1.6 million.""
We wondered if the number of families living in extreme poverty — defined as households living on less than $2 in cash per person per day — has more than doubled, and we also wanted to know if the 1996 legislation caused that trend.
We found that the best estimates show Sanders’ numbers are right on, and there is some well-regarded research that ties welfare reform to the rise in extreme poverty.
The numbers
Sanders’ campaign pointed us to figures from the Census’ Survey of Income and Program Participation, which researchers Kathryn Edin and Luke Shaefer examined in their 2015 book, $2.00 a Day: Living on Almost Nothing in America.
When welfare reform passed in 1996, there were about 636,000 American households living on $2 per person per day or less. As of mid 2013, that figure has more than doubled, to about 1.5 million such households, with about 3 million children living in these circumstances.
That’s a 130 percent growth in families in extreme poverty, compared to just about 20 percent growth in the population as a whole.
This data has some shortcomings, acknowledged by Edin and Shaefer, professors at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Michigan, respectively. For example, there are concerns that survey respondents misreport how much cash assistance they receive from the government, which could mean that some of these households actually have cash income higher than $2 a day.
Additionally, SIPP only counts cash income, so it doesn’t capture whether these families receive in-kind government benefits like food stamps, Medicaid, child day care or subsidized housing.
Even if the SIPP data isn’t perfect, Edin and Shaefer found that the general trend was consistent with corresponding data, such as an increase in those reporting zero income among people receiving benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known colloquially as SNAP or food stamps.
In any case, by a reasonable measure, Sanders’ figures are correct.
The causes
What was welfare reform? The bipartisan legislation sought to encourage the poor to join the workforce and stay there. It responded to a sense that welfare recipients were choosing government cash over getting a job.
The law put a five-year lifetime limit on receiving welfare cash, established as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and it established workforce participation requirements. The previous program had no such requirements. Welfare reform, combined with earned income tax credit expansions and a booming economy, benefited the working poor, experts told us.
But the instability of the low-wage market revealed the program to be an ineffective safety net for people who weren't able to find and keep work, Edin and Shaefer found. They aren’t able to maintain a stable earned income, and as a result they cannot reap the benefits of a work-based safety net and the earned income tax credit.
""We believe a lot of families are better off as a result of the package of changes made during the 1990s, in particular the EITC,"" Shaefer told PolitiFact. ""Those who are able to maintain employment, buffer against the instability, receive more assistance than ever before. It’s those at the very bottom that we argue are doing worse.""
Just 23 out of every 100 people living in poverty receive welfare cash, as of 2014, and that ratio has dropped nearly every year since 1996 when it was 68 out of 100, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. People living in extreme poverty might not be taking advantage of welfare cash benefits because of the stigma, lack of confidence in the program, or the work requirements and time limits, contributing to some families’ extremely low cash income.
Welfare reform put TANF administration into the hands of the states in the form of block grants. This means that states can use the funding for cash benefits or for administering programs intended to increase employment, like childcare or job training. But there is wide variation between the states as a result. For example, in 2013, 78 out of 100 impoverished families in Vermont received cash benefits, but just 4 out of 100 did in Louisiana.
Shaefer said some states use these block grants to pay for programs they would have paid for absent the federal funds, leading to less cash in the hands of individuals.
Certain states and the 1996 legislation for structuring welfare in such a way are both responsible for these state-level shortcomings, said Ron Haskins, who was involved in crafting welfare reform and is now codirector of the Brookings Center on Children and Families.
There are other factors affecting this upward trend in extreme poverty, including broader economic trends affecting low-wage employment and housing stability, Edin and Schaefer note. But there’s no doubt that welfare reform played a role.
""I think welfare reform was one major factor driving the increase in extreme poverty and probably the biggest single factor, although it’s harder to be sure about the second claim,"" said Christopher Jencks, professor of social policy at Harvard University.
Though acknowledging extremely poor people who are unable to maintain a job would have been better off under the pre-reform system, Haskins said Sanders is ignoring all the positive benefits of welfare reform. For example, poverty among single-mother households, which were most affected by by welfare reform, is lower than what it was prior to welfare reform, even during the Great Recession.
""Sanders is onto something, but he only told half the story,"" Haskins said.
Our ruling
Sanders said, ""Since (welfare reform) was signed into law, the number of families living in extreme poverty has more than doubled.""
Sanders is talking about a very specific and small percentage of American households living on less than $2 cash income per person per day. That figure has more than doubled from 636,000 to 1.5 million since 1996 when Bill Clinton signed welfare reform.
The data isn’t a perfect capture of how much these people receive in government benefits, and only so much blame can be placed on welfare reform legislation. But experts told us the law did play a significant role in this trend.
We rate Sanders’ claim Mostly True."

","What do witches have to do with your favorite beer?
When I pose this question to students in my American literature and culture classes, I receive stunned silence or nervous laughs. The Sanderson sisters didn't chug down bottles of Sam Adams in “Hocus Pocus."" But the history of beer points to a not-so-magical legacy of transatlantic slander and gender roles.
Up until the 1500s, brewing was primarily women's work – that is, until a smear campaign accused women brewers of being witches. Much of the iconography we associate with witches today, from the pointy hat to the broom, emerged from their connection to female brewers. A routine household taskHumans have been drinking beer for almost 7,000 years, and the original brewers were women. From the Vikings to the Egyptians, women brewed beer both for religious ceremonies and to make a practical, calorie-rich beverage for the home. In fact, the nun Hildegard von Bingen, who lived in modern-day Germany, famously wrote about hops in the 12th century and added the ingredient to her beer recipe.From the Stone Age to the 1700s, ale – and, later, beer – was a household staple for most families in England and other parts of Europe. The drink was an inexpensive way to consume and preserve grains. For the working class, beer provided an important source of nutrients, full of carbohydrates and proteins. Because the beverage was such a common part of the average person's diet, fermenting was, for many women, one of their normal household tasks. Some enterprising women took this household skill to the marketplace and began selling beer. Widows or unmarried women used their fermentation prowess to earn some extra money, while married women partnered with their husbands to run their beer business. Exiling women from the industrySo if you traveled back in time to the Middle Ages or the Renaissance and went to a market in England, you'd probably see an oddly familiar sight: women wearing tall, pointy hats. In many instances, they'd be standing in front of big cauldrons.But these women were no witches; they were brewers.They wore the tall, pointy hats so that their customers could see them in the crowded marketplace. They transported their brew in cauldrons. And those who sold their beer out of stores had cats not as demon familiars, but to keep mice away from the grain. Just as women were establishing their foothold in the beer markets of England, Ireland and the rest of Europe, the Inquisition began. The fundamentalist religious movement, which originated in the early 16th century, preached stricter gender norms and condemned witchcraft. Male brewers saw an opportunity. To reduce their competition in the beer trade, these men accused female brewers of being witches and using their cauldrons to brew up magic potions instead of booze. Unfortunately, the rumors took hold.Over time, it became more dangerous for women to practice brewing and sell beer because they could be misidentified as witches. At the time, being accused of witchcraft wasn't just a social faux pas; it could result in prosecution or a death sentence. Women accused of witchcraft were often ostracized in their communities, imprisoned or even killed. Some men didn't really believe that the women brewers were witches. However, many did believe that women shouldn't be spending their time making beer. The process took time and dedication: hours to prepare the ale, sweep the floors clean and lift heavy bundles of rye and grain. If women couldn't brew ale, they would have significantly more time at home to raise their children. In the 1500s some towns, such as Chester, England, actually made it illegal for most women to sell beer, worried that young alewives would grow up into old spinsters.[Get the best of The Conversation, every weekend. Sign up for our weekly newsletter.]Men still run the showThe iconography of witches with their pointy hats and cauldrons has endured, as has men's domination of the beer industry: The top 10 beer companies in the world are headed by male CEOs and have mostly male board members.Major beer companies have tended to portray beer as a drink for men. Some scholars have even gone as far as calling beer ads “manuals on masculinity.""This gender bias seems to persist in smaller craft breweries as well. A study at Stanford University found that while 17% of craft beer breweries have one female CEO, only 4% of these businesses employ a female brewmaster – the expert supervisor who oversees the brewing process.It doesn't have to be this way.

","In a wide-ranging interview published on Truthout, the legendary political activist and social critic Noam Chomsky explains the multi-fold factors that propelled Donald Trump to victory in 2016 and what progressives can do to beat the fascistic elements that fuel his popularity.
Chomsky refuses to offer up easy answers or let Democrats off the hook. In fact, he starts with a critique of President Barack Obama, who failed to deliver on policy on many issues despite the lofty rhetoric of his campaign.
""Many were seduced by the rhetoric of “hope” and “change,” and deeply disillusioned by the very early discovery that the words had little substance,"" Chomsky observes. ""I don’t usually agree with Sarah Palin, but she had a point when she ridiculed this hopey-changey stuff. A fair number of Obama voters, mostly working people, switched to Trump.""
But Chomsky also acknowledges the visceral rage of racist whites triggered by Obama's election.
""Quite apart from Obama’s disappointing policies, he and the [Democratic] Party were victims of the intense racism that is deeply rooted in large parts of American society. The visceral hatred of Obama cannot be explained in other terms.""
On the Republican end, Chomsky notes that the party establishment tried to suppress—or exploit—the fringe candidates on the right as they pursued their pro-corporate agenda. But they could only do that for so long.
""The establishment was able to suppress them and gain their own candidate, but that didn’t change the basis for their support,"" he says. Furthermore, the GOP establishment's policy platform is so antithetical to what most Americans want that they made themselves largely irrelevant.
""For years, both parties have drifted to the right — the Republicans off the spectrum of normal parliamentary politics. Their dedication to wealth and corporate power is so extreme that they cannot get votes on their actual policies — which are now being revealed to us daily — and so have had to mobilize a voting base on issues unrelated to their service to their actual constituency.""
Chomsky fears that Donald Trump's high approval rating among Republicans, while not totally surprising at this stage of his presidency, shows America is in a very dangerous place.
""Trump’s roughly 90 percent support among Republicans is actually not unusual for an incumbent party at this stage in office — about the same as Obama among Democrats, though the fervor and passion are different, presumably reflecting the general atmosphere of anger, hatred and fear. And frightening. Recognizing the great differences, I still can’t repress childhood memories of hearing Hitler’s Nuremberg rallies on the radio, not understanding the words, though the mood was unmistakable.""
Chomsky points out that Trump regularly delivers to his base, so liberals shouldn't assume they're in the clear. He also seems to be having ""the time of his life"" in the limelight.
Lastly, Chomsky cautions Democrats to avoid smugness, and just presume there's a blue wave on the horizon just because Trump is loathed by their base
""The barriers are not insuperable, but to overcome them will require large-scale and effective organization based on popular mass movements."""

","Fox News’ Tucker Carlson is under fire this week for racist, sexist, and homophobic comments he made while chatting on “Bubba the Love Sponge” a shock jock radio show between 2006-2011. Groups are scrutinizing Fox’s advertisers and demanding that they drop the show.
But Carlson also publishes The Daily Caller, a controversial online media outlet with ties to white nationalists that has infamously peddled everything from climate denial and anti-Islamic tropes to false prostitution charges and violence against protesters.
Carlson’s moonlighting as an extremist at The Daily Caller is heavily bankrolled by — you guessed it — the Koch brothers. An investigation by the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) finds that the Charles Koch Foundation has poured more than $2.7 million into the Daily Caller’s non-profit “charity” since 2012, which generates the lion’s share of the “news” that the Caller publishes.
Indeed, in 2016, Koch cash accounted for 83 percent of the The Daily Caller News Foundation’s $1.1 million in revenues.
Carlson Under Fire
As if catering to white supremacists was not bad enough, Media Matters published an inventory of hateful comments made by Carlson as a guest on the show between 2006-2011.
The radio host discusses Warren Jeffs, the religious leader who was investigated in 2007 for marrying off underage girls to older men and was eventually jailed for sexual assault of minors in 2011. When the radio host condemned Jeffs for being an “accessory to the rape of children,” Carlson said “whatever the hell that means,” and going on to suggest that forcible underage marriage is not as serious as forcible child rape. Listen to the tape here.
In other interviews, Carlson called Iraqis “semi-literate primitive monkeys,” who “don’t use toilet paper or forks.” They should just “shut the fuck up and obey.” Carlson spoke about his desire for a presidential candidate to blame the “lunatic Muslims who are behaving like animals.” That candidate would be “elected king” if they vowed to “kill as many of them as [they] can.” Carlson also said Afghanistan is “never going to be a civilized country because the people aren’t civilized.” Listen to the tape here.
The release of the older audio tapes gives “context and insight” on his nightly programming today, said Media Matters President Angelo Carusone on MSNBC.
So far, Carlson has failed to apologize. As Fox News scrambles to control the damage, at least three advertisers — Allergan, letgo, and GreatCall — have had enough.
But with the focus on advertisers, it’s important to remember who else bankrolls Carlson’s mini media empire.
The Koch Caller?
The Kochs have long underwritten The Daily Caller. Previously, CMD reported that the Kochs gave $805,512 to The Daily Caller News Foundation between 2012 and 2015, predominantly from the Charles G. Koch Foundation. Since then, the numbers have continued to grow.
The Koch foundation gave another $946,000 in 2016 and $960,000 in 2017, the last year publicly available — for a total of $2.7 million.
In 2017, CMD analyzed emails sent by the Trump campaign to The Daily Caller subscribers and estimated that the outlet also received at least $150,000 from the Trump campaign in the months right before the November election, based on the fee charged for mailings to its list. The funding was never disclosed by Carlson or The Daily Caller as they reported on the Trump campaign.
In addition, CMD also examined the relationship between the non-profit and for-profit arms of Tucker Carlson’s operation. The mechanics of how they operate together raise serious concerns about whether Carlson’s tax-free nonprofit is operating primarily for the private benefit of his for-profit media outlet, which would be a violation of tax law.
CMD’s story was picked up by numerous media outlets including the Washington Post, which interviewed tax experts on the legality of the scheme.
“It really does look like the reason for the existence of this 501(c)(3) organization is to provide benefits to the for-profit company, and that should be a private benefit that is not acceptable,” Linda Sugin, a law professor at Fordham University, told the Post and other media outlets. “You can’t have money going into the foundation being used for purposes that are really to support the for-profit organization.”"

","Equally important to the future of progressives in the Democratic Party is Mr. Sanders’s strength in the white working-class areas where Mr. Bradley, Mr. Obama, and both Mr. Brown and Mr. Tsongas faltered. It was Mr. Sanders’s strength among these voters that let him stay fairly competitive, even though he lost half of the traditional left-liberal coalition.
Mr. Sanders won white voters without a college degree by a double-digit margin in Connecticut, as he did in Maryland, Wisconsin, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Illinois, Oklahoma, Indiana, Vermont and Michigan. He probably did so in Rhode Island as well (no exit polls were conducted there).
Outside the South, Mrs. Clinton probably won white voters without a college degree only in Ohio (the exit polls there show she prevailed with that group by one point).
One possible explanation, again, is policy. Income inequality has become a vastly more important issue to Democrats since the Great Recession, and it’s reasonable to assume that white working-class Democrats might be especially drawn to the issue. This is the best case for the progressive left; it would mean that a future progressive populist could count on similar levels of support with a strong, class-oriented message.
The evidence for this view is somewhat mixed. According a compilation of exit polls, around 40 percent of white voters without a college degree wanted more liberal policies than those of Mr. Obama, and Mr. Sanders won these voters handily. The highest number was in Vermont, where 46 percent of white voters without a degree wanted more liberal policies than Mr. Obama’s.
That’s a big bloc that progressives can count on in the future, but it’s not a majority and it’s less than Mr. Sanders’s share of white voters without a degree. That’s in part because Mr. Sanders also won among those white working-class voters who wanted less liberal policies than those of Mr. Obama, a fact that makes Mr. Sanders look as much like a protest vote against Mrs. Clinton as the harbinger of a new Democratic socialism.
But it is nonetheless striking that so many white Democrats without a degree wanted more liberal policies than Mr. Obama’s. In fact, white voters without a college degree were often more likely than either college-educated white voters or minorities to support more liberal policies."

Vice President John Nance Garner once said that being the vice president was “not worth a bucket of warm piss.” (Many know this quote as “bucket of warm spit.” It’s “piss.”) The current holder of that office, Mike Pence, showed on Sunday that Garner, if alive, would owe an apology to piss buckets everywhere.
Pence used the NFL to star in a cheap, transparent political stunt. The narrative Pence tried—and failed—to sell was that he showed up at the Colts-49ers game in Indianapolis and then supposedly left in a huff after being shocked—shocked!—to see the San Francisco 49ers kneel. After assumedly taking a whiff of his personal smelling salts, he immediately released a statement that magically was already prepared, which read in part, “I left today’s Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.”
Forget for a moment that this is a vice president who fronts for a commander in chief who mocked a POW and insulted the family of a slain solider, yet blathers about “disrespect.” Forget that he just used “soldiers, Flag, and National Anthem” for his own form of protest (irony!). Forget even his bizarre capitalization of “Flag.”
It’s not what happened. It’s how it happened. This was staged: a taxpayer-subsidized stunt aimed at attacking dissenting black athletes. It was revealed in record time to be yet another toxic effort by this administration to divide people along racial lines and distract us from a train wreck of an administration, described by Senator Bob Corker as “an adult day care center” that looks after a big orange baby.
The first sign that Pence’s scurrying-off was staged: These were the San Francisco 49ers that the Colts were playing. The 49ers have been protesting racism during the anthem for over a year. Led by safety Eric Reid, the first player to kneel with Colin Kaepernick over a year ago, the 49ers are the team you’d pick if you wanted to fake outrage about someone’s peacefully protesting police brutality. Peter Alexander of NBC News tweeted almost immediately, “Reporters [accompanying Pence] were told to stay in van bc ‘there may be an early departure from the game.’” In other words, in advance of the anthem, Pence was planning to show up and then leave.
Then the veep’s own publicly available schedule tripped him up. That morning, his team let it be known that Pence would be at a California fundraiser by 6:30 pm. The plane was gassed up and ready to go. Pence actually flew from Nevada to Indianapolis to go to a game for five minutes only to fly back to the West Coast. As Sports Illustrated’s Peter King tweeted, “@VP took a taxpayer-funded airplane knowing he’d be walking out right after the anthem to protest. Swell use of our tax dollars.”
When you factor in the Secret Service, the diverting of law enforcement, as well as the clearing of air and road traffic to get him in and out, this was at least a six-figure authoritarian stunt. Current Issue View our current issue
Just to add an even thicker lacquer of incompetence, Pence tweeted out a photo of himself from the game; yet, as The Indianapolis Star quickly noted, the photo was from 2014.
Then, like a baby who wants to show a room of adults what’s in his diaper, Trump tweeted out that this was all his doing, hanging Pence out to dry. He wrote, “I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country.”
This was amateur-hour fraud. It was Gulf of Tonkin for idiots: a ham-handed effort to isolate people brave enough to dissent in the face of the most powerful people in the world and raise issues of racism that this administration is too craven to discuss. It’s also very disturbing. The very week Sarah Huckabee Sanders spoke about Trump’s “respect for the First Amendment,” we had a staged spectacle with the highest levels of government attempting to intimidate and coerce people to not exercise those rights. It’s disgusting, and another example of Pence’s degradation, his Faustian bargain with this administration. If Mike Pence thinks he can deodorize Trump with a fraudulent photo op, he should know that even the contents of John Nance Garner’s bucket gives off less of a stench."

","Like it or not, Alex Jones is getting a seat at the White House press table, so what he says actually does matter, especially when you consider his expertise at spreading fake news such as the notion that Lady Gaga uttered some kind of Satanic incantation during her Super Bowl performance last night.
Today's fare is slightly less insane, but only slightly. Jones, you see, wants everyone to know he would lay down his life for his brother Donald Trump. Not only that, but people who leak things are worthy of execution.
You read that right. Execution.
""Trump is so fire-breathing, so energetic, so cunning, so real, and he’s having results so amazing that it just makes me endeared to Trump,"" Jones gushed. ""I’m ready to die for Trump, at this point. And I’m already ready to die for America, it’s the same feeling I have for America, because he is America, you’re America.""
But you liberals, not so much. You're not America.
He kept going. ""It’s the same way I get endeared to people I know that have fought hard and lost legs or arms for this country and just how hard working and good they are and how compared to the average person who’s lazy and doesn’t care, I just feel humble to be around those type of people.""
Someone is going to have to explain the leap Jones makes from ""energetic, so cunning, so real"" to veterans who actually had arms and legs blown off in war. Also, could someone ask him if he feels humble to be around people like Senator Tammy Duckworth. I'm pretty sure he'd make a distinction.
In addition to being a diviner of Satanic incantations, Jones is also a ""policy wonk,"" by his own proclamation. ""I know that Trump and [Stephen] Bannon really know what are happening... they’re really trying to cut taxes, they’re really trying to get loans to small businesses, they’re really trying to get us out of carbon taxes and Obamacare, and they’re doing it, they’re delivering.""
Not so much. BUT IT'S JUST LIKE 1776.
""This is bigger than 1776 if Trump can deliver!""
Apparently, though, he's a little bummed about bureaucrats leaking things.
""And then I see all the news -- I’ve got articles today, 'Ha ha, there’s tens of thousands of bureaucrats that are going to leak everything you’re doing militarily and sabotage you.' That’s called treason. That’s executionable.”
Actually, it's just batsh*t crazy. And that crazy is being blasted out on the Internet to hundreds of thousands of Alex Jones listeners, who would be more than willing to pick up a gun and shoot those bastards leaking. That's called incitement, Alex.
By the way, if Alex Jones is so anxious to die for His Messiah, perhaps he should be first in line to enlist for military service. That's the quickest way for him to realize his dream, and I guarantee Trump will have plenty of opportunities for martyrdom.

","But amid all the expected Viking imagery and nods to the Crusaders has been another dormant “medievalism"" that has yet to be fully acknowledged in reporting on both the far right and conspiracy theorist movements: the Byzantine Empire.Byzantium – or more properly, the medieval Roman Empire – controlled much of the Mediterranean at the height of its territorial rule in the mid-sixth century. Centered in modern-day Istanbul from A.D. 330 to 1453, its capital of Constantinople was a thriving intellectual, political and military power. One of its crowning achievements, the church of Hagia Sophia, is a testament to the empire's architectural and artistic prowess.But in the Western world, the Byzantine Empire has been largely overlooked and forgotten. High school students in the United States are likely to know little about the empire. And nowadays, the word “byzantine"" has simply come to mean complicated, secret and bureaucratic. This lowering of its status isn't entirely a new process. As far back as 1776, English historian Edward Gibbon was disparagingly referring to the empire's inhabitants as “the servile and effeminate Greeks of Byzantium."" A 'New Byzantium'Despite this modern disdain for Byzantium in the West, it has recently served as an inspiration to various factions of the far right.In September 2017, Jason Kessler, an American neo-Nazi who helped organize the “Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, inaugurated a new supremacist group called “The New Byzantium"" project.Described by Kessler as “a premier organization for pro-white advocacy in the 21st century,"" The New Byzantium is based on the white supremacist leader's misrepresentation of history.His premise is that when Rome fell, the Byzantine Empire went on to preserve a white-European civilization. This isn't true. In reality the empire was made up of diverse peoples who walked the streets of its capital, coming from as far away as Nubia, Ethiopia, Syria and North Africa. Contemporaneous sources noted – at times with disdain – the racial and ethnic diversity of both Constantinople and the empire's emperors.But Kessler's “New Byzantium"" is intended to preserve white dominance after what he calls “the inevitable collapse of the American Empire."" The organization has been operating under the radar since 2017 with little online footprint. The original 'deep state'Kessler isn't alone in appropriating the empire. Through my research, I have monitored references of Byzantium in online forums. Mentions of Byzantium are scattered across message boards frequented by both white supremacists and QAnon enthusiasts – who spout conspiracy theories about a deep-state cabal of Satan-worshipping, blood-drinking pedophiles running the world.Across 8kun and other online platforms I have reviewed, the Byzantine Empire is discussed as either continuing the legacy of Rome after it was, in their understanding, “destroyed by the Jews"" or being the only true empire, with Rome being merely a historical myth created to degrade Byzantium's power and importance. This latter story emerges in a QAnon thread on “Baking"" – that is, the connecting and weaving together of drops (messages) by the enigmatic Q. One post states: “It all makes sense when you learn that the books of the bible are plagiarized copies of the chronology of Byzantium, and so is the mythical Roman Empire, that never existed in Italy but was in fact centered in Constantinople."" Other QAnon commentators across message boards and Twitter speak of the “exiled throne of Byzantium,"" noting, “the Empire never went away, it just went occult."" They exclaim “Long live Byzantium"" and call for a “return to Byzantium"" to save people from the satanists.Oddly, while some hold up the Byzantine Empire as the vanguard of white supremacy, a smaller group of white supremacists and conspiracy theorists sees it as “the original Deep State.""In some renditions, Byzantium is, by way of some hazy illuminati connections, the origins of the “deep state"" – the myth of an underground cabal of elites who run the world in secret. It has persisted in secrecy since Constantinople's fall, either trading in eunuchs on the clandestine market or preserving whiteness and Christianity, depending on the thread's negative or positive outlook on the empire.Reconquest of Hagia SophiaFor many on the far right, talk of Byzantium is cloaked in Islamophobia – both online and in tragic real-life events.A white supremacist who killed more than 50 worshippers at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019 railed against the Turks and the conquest of Constantinople in a 74-page manifesto.“We are coming for Constantinople, and we will destroy every mosque and minaret in the city. The Hagia Sophia will be free of minarets and Constantinople will be rightfully Christian owned once more,"" the shooter wrote. Throughout QAnon message boards, the reconquest of Hagia Sophia is emblematic of the destruction of Islam and the restoration of a mythic white Byzantium. One post stated: “When we free Constantinople and the Hagia Sophia, maybe we can talk.""'Third Rome'This “reconquest"" of Constantinople had even been tied in some online posts to the presidency of Donald Trump, with images circulated online seemingly prophesying that it would happen under his tenure. In one image, Trump is seen congratulating Russian President Vladimir Putin “on the retaking of Constantinople"" and shaking hands in front of what is presumably meant to be the Hagia Sophia, though is actually the Sultan Ahmed Mosque, also known as the Blue Mosque.Putin himself is not averse to drawing on the symbolism of Byzantium. The Russian state has long tried to position itself as the rightful successor to the Byzantine Empire, with Moscow as the “Third Rome."" This forms part of a religious and political doctrine tied to Russian territorial expansion that can be traced back as far as the late 15th century.The far-right appropriation of Byzantium in the U.S. appears to be influenced by this Russian interpretation. Indeed, Russian proponents of the “Third Rome"" doctrine have been cited as influences by prominent figures on the American right.No matter the provenance of the recent interest in Byzantium from America's white supremacists and conspiracy theorists, one thing is clear: It is based on a very warped idea of the Byzantine Empire that has emerged out of the empire's fraught place in our histories, caught between ancient and medieval, spirituality and bureaucracy.

","President Donald Trump is expected to lift the ban on overseas CIA “black site” prisons, reversing an executive action signed by Barack Obama to shut down such sites.
Mr Trump will revoke the restrictions put into place by the Obama administration, which had been celebrated by human rights advocates, as he asserts a more openly aggressive approach to dealing with suspected terrorism abroad.
The draft order, titled “Detention and Interrogation of Enemy Combatants”, would also revoke the International Committee of the Red Cross’ access to wartime detainees.
The document orders top national security officials to ""recommend to the president whether to reinitiate a program of interrogation of high-value alien terrorists to be operated outside the United States and whether such program should include the use of detention facilities operated by the Central Intelligence Agency"".
Mr Trump made it clear that he hopes to bring back waterboarding and a “hell of a lot worse”. But the President claimed that Defence Secretary James Mattis convinced him to tone down his position on torture.
""Give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers,"" Mr Trump claimed Mr Mattis said during their November meeting, ""and I do better with that than I do with torture.""

Mr Bush's directive defined prisoner abuses that counted as war crimes under international law. It still allowed interrogators to use tactics that were not included in the list.

President Obama issued an overhaul in the US detention policy that undid much of what the second Bush administration allowed, limiting interrogation techniques to what was listed in the Army Field Manual. Congress approved an action to make that directive a law.

""The president can sign whatever executive orders he likes. But the law is the law,"" said Republican Sen John McCain. The Arizona senator was held captive during the Vietnam War – for which Mr Trump ridiculed him during the campaign.
""We are not bringing back torture in the United States of America.""

","WASHINGTON ― Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) is calling on Republicans to delay a vote on their tax reform legislation until after newly elected Alabama Sen. Doug Jones is officially seated.
“It would be wrong for Senate Republicans to jam through this tax bill without giving the duly elected senator from Alabama a chance to cast his vote,” Schumer said Wednesday at a press conference.
Jones, a Democrat, accomplished a stunning victory in Tuesday night’s special election in Alabama by defeating Roy Moore, who had been accused of sexual misconduct by several women.
With Jones in the Senate, Republicans will only have a 51-member majority.
Republican lawmakers in the House and the Senate are hashing out the differences between their two tax bills behind closed doors this week, and final vote is expected sometime next week.
“Our hope is that [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell will do the right thing,” Schumer said.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) also called on McConnell (R-Ky.) to seat Jones “without any delay.”"

","Comedian Michelle Wolf was specifically called out for the comments she made about press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who attended the dinner. | Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images for Netflix Michelle Wolf: ‘I wouldn’t change a single word that I said’
Comedian Michelle Wolf on Monday stood by her performance at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner after drawing criticism from journalists and President Donald Trump.
“I mean, I’m honestly — I wouldn’t change a single word that I said,” Wolf told NPR in her first interview since the dinner on Saturday. The interview is scheduled to air Tuesday. “I’m very happy with what I said, and I’m glad I stuck to my guns.”
Wolf’s performance drew criticism from a number of journalists, with the president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, Margaret Talev issuing a statement on Sunday saying the comedian’s monologue was “not in the spirit” of the dinner.
Trump, who did not attend the dinner, criticized Wolf and the dinner over the weekend and on Monday.
“The so-called comedian really ‘bombed,’” Trump said of Wolf on Twitter on Sunday.
The president tweeted on Monday that the dinner was “dead” and “was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great Country and all that it stands for.”
But Wolf, best known as a correspondent on “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah,” said she believed that people expected her to be nice because she is a woman.
“I think — I don’t know, maybe I’m projecting this — but I think sometimes they look at a woman and they think, ‘Oh, she’ll be nice,’” she said, “and if you’ve seen any of my comedy you know that I don’t … pull punches. I’m not afraid to talk about things. And I don’t think they expected that from me.”
Wolf was specifically called out for the comments she made about press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who attended the dinner. Wolf compared Sanders to Aunt Lydia, a character on the dystopian TV series “The Handmaid’s Tale,” and also called her an “Uncle Tom” for white women.
In the NPR interview, the comedian said that people should have the ability to laugh at themselves.
“There’s plenty where you could look back and the camera was on Obama when people were making pretty aggressive jokes about Obama, and he was laughing,” Wolf said. “And I think having the ability to laugh at yourself is important.”
Wolf went on to say she believed that Sanders attended the dinner as a protest and was not there to celebrate the news media. For example, Wolf said, Sanders did not stand up and congratulate reporters who got awards, specifically those from CNN.
“I would say if this is about celebrating the media,” Wolf said of Sanders, “she wasn’t there to celebrate the media.”"

","Summary
Since the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, business interests and conservative politicians have warned that raising the minimum wage would be ruinous. Even modest increases, they’ve asserted, will cause the U.S. economy to hemorrhage jobs, shutter businesses, reduce labor hours, and disproportionately cast young people, so-called low-skilled workers, and workers of color to the bread lines. As recently as this year, the same claims have been repeated, nearly verbatim.
Raise wages, lose jobs, the refrain seems to go.
If the claims of minimum-wage opponents are akin to saying “the sky is falling,” this report is an effort to check whether the sky did indeed fall. In this report, we examine the historical data relating to the 22 increases in the federal minimum wage between 1938 and 2009 to determine whether or not these claims—that if you raise wages, you will lose jobs—can be substantiated. We examine employment trends before and after minimum-wage increases, looking both at the overall labor market and at key indicator sectors that are most affected by minimum-wage increases. Rather than an academic study that seeks to measure causal effects using techniques such as regression analysis, this report assesses opponents’ claims about raising the minimum wage on their own terms by examining simple indicators and job trends.
The results were clear: these basic economic indicators show no correlation between federal minimum-wage increases and lower employment levels, even in the industries that are most impacted by higher minimum wages. To the contrary, in the substantial majority of instances (68 percent) overall employment increased after a federal minimum-wage increase. In the most substantially affected industries, the rates were even higher: in the leisure and hospitality sector employment rose 82 percent of the time following a federal wage increase, and in the retail sector it was 73 percent of the time. Moreover, the small minority of instances in which employment—either overall or in the indicator sectors—declined following a federal minimum-wage increase all occurred during periods of recession or near recession. That pattern strongly suggests that the few instances of such declines in employment are better explained by the overall national business cycle than by the minimum wage.
These employment trends after federal minimum-wage increases are not surprising, as they are in line with the findings of the substantial majority of modern minimum-wage research. As Goldman Sachs analysts recently noted, citing a state-of-the-art 2010 study by University of California economists that examined job-growth patterns across every border in the U.S. where one county had a higher wage than a neighboring county, “the economic literature has typically found no effect on employment” from recent U.S. minimum-wage increases.[1] This report’s findings mirror decades of more sophisticated academic research, providing simple confirmation that opponents’ perennial predictions of job losses when minimum-wage increases are proposed are rooted in ideology, not evidence.

Gone are the days when a job applicant could make a good first impression with a smart suit and firm handshake. Now your first impression might get boiled down to three digits on a botched credit rap sheet, leading a boss to reject you, sight unseen.
But the city where first impressions count for everything is about to make the job market a little less judgmental. New York’s City Council just voted overwhelmingly to outlaw the common practice of letting employers prejudge people based on their credit history—passing an unprecedented ban against employers use of workers’ credit background data.
The legislation, which passed last Thursday following an extensive grassroots campaign by local and national labor and community groups, restricts a boss, prospective employer or agency from “us[ing] an individual’s consumer credit history in making employment decisions.”
The final version incorporates some compromises pushed by the business lobby, such as carve-outs for positions that could involve handling “financial agreements valued at $10,000 or more,” police and national-security related jobs, or workers with access to “trade secrets.” While business groups cited these provisions as wins in a bill they otherwise chafed at, economic justice advocates have nonetheless hailed the law as a promising boost for an emerging nationwide movement.
Sarah Ludwig of the New Economy Project says, “It’s a strong law…and it’s going to cover most New Yorkers [and] most jobs by far and away. It’s a real civil rights victory.”
Enforcement of the law will be driven by a complaint process, which makes it a tricky game for the city authorities relying on workers to come forward. But Ludwig adds, advocates hope the system provides a platform for the city’s Human Rights Commission to gain new prominence under the de Blasio administration’s leadership, since the city has “this unbelievably strong human rights law” on paper but not necessarily in practice.
Similar legislation has passed in other areas, building on weak federal transparency regulations, but has been criticized for being diluted with corporate-friendly exemptions.
The rationale behind the ban is simple: it’s unfair and useless to use a person’s credit history, which is often inaccurate or misleading, when assessing their job qualifications. When corporations use massive data screenings to hire and fire en masse, credit checks can drastically narrow an applicant pool and subsequently be held as a cudgel over desperate job seekers and compel them to expose private background information.
There’s nothing meritocratic about this practice. But it is racially biased, and very cruel to the poor.
According to the think tank Demos, a negative credit record is associated with many of the disadvantages of being poor, jobless, not white, or in poor health—and not with how trustworthy you are or how well you write computer code or repair a car. But since employers can generally pull up credit data (which has historically been used for actuarial determinations of financial risk, not intended for employment-related decisions), this information can easily be misinterpreted or manipulated. By providing convenient proxies for race and class, data can become a tool to simultaneously affirm and perpetuate negative stereotypes of workers based on arbitrary factors.
As Gustavo, a Queens worker, testified, recalling being rejected repeatedly after co-signing a bad loan for his sister years ago: “It’s unfair not to hire someone because they have a stain on their credit report [out] of no fault of their own.”
As Demos explained in a report on credit checks, basing hiring on credit history may be tantamount to disqualifying people for having too many kids or being too sick to work. A survey of those who reported poor credit found that “having unpaid medical bills or medical debt is cited as one of the leading causes of bad credit…with more than half citing medical bills as a factor.”
Racial stratification also tracks “creditworthiness”: “Most white households (59 percent) report scores of 700 or above, displaying strong credit, while less than one quarter of African-Americans (24 percent) are able to attain the same high credit rating status.”
Such patterns feed underlying inequities intertwined with employment discrimination: bad credit histories hurt future access to credit, tracking people into more structural hardship. And to mine the ruins of this social devastation, Demos notes, “predatory lending schemes in the last decade targeted communities of color, compounding historic disparities in wealth and assets, and leaving African-Americans, Latinos, and other people of color at greater risk of foreclosure and default on loans. Employment credit checks can perpetuate and amplify this injustice.”
Played out on a mass scale, this folds into trends of neighborhoods cratering under collapsing mortgages and disinvestment—a wholesale erosion of community economic resilience driven by big finance—particularly in already racially stratified regions.
In New York especially, where local housing and job opportunity remains severely segregated, an ever-deepening credit hole becomes a pretext for employers to discriminate, and to keep them from getting the job they need to climb out of said hole…and you get the picture.
New York City is now set to break the cycle. Ludwig suspects Wall Street is now on alert for a potential ripple effect in other cities and states and even for the advancement of a national law, since protecting people from invasive credit snooping fits well with basic constitutional precepts. “It’s a huge civil rights issue along racial lines, but it’s also a huge privacy issue,” she says. “Because if you are applying for a job, why should your prospective employer know that you lost your house…or that you broke up with your spouse and that created financial distress.”
Nationally, Ludwig says, “There’s nothing that would stop Congress from passing such a law except Congress itself.”
The financial sector is currently the top political campaign donor to federal candidates and parties, so a restriction on the data mine that serves as the industry’s bread-and-butter isn’t likely to get much traction in Washington. Then again, New York is home to Wall Street, and if such a ban can make it here, maybe a failure to stop the monstrous cycle of bad credit will soon be counted as a taint on politicians’ records too."

","A former hedge fund manager turned pharmaceutical businessman has purchased the rights to a 62-year-old drug used for treating life-threatening parasitic infections and raised the price overnight from $13.50 per tablet to $750.
WATCH: Ex-hedge funder who hiked AIDS pill cost by 5,500 percent says drug ‘still underpriced’
According to the New York Times, Martin Shkreli, 32, the founder and chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, purchased the rights to Daraprim for $55 million on the same day that Turing announced it had raised $90 million from Shkreli and other investors in its first round of financing.
RELATED: These 37 tweets show how the pharma CEO gouging AIDS patients is even worse than you think
Daraprim is used for treating toxoplasmosis -- an opportunistic parasitic infection that can cause serious or even life-threatening problems in babies and for people with compromised immune systems like AIDS patients and certain cancer patients -- that sold for slightly over $1 a tablet several years ago. Prices have increased as the rights to the drug have been passed from one pharmaceutical company to the next, but nothing like the almost 5,500 percent increase since Shkreli acquired it.
Worrying that the cost of treatment could devastate some patients, Dr. Judith Aberg, the chief of the division of infectious diseases at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai asked, ""What is it that they are doing differently that has led to this dramatic increase?”
According to Shkreli, Turing will use the money it earns to develop better treatments for toxoplasmosis, with fewer side effects.
“This isn’t the greedy drug company trying to gouge patients, it is us trying to stay in business,” Shkreli explained, saying that many patients use the drug for far less than a year and that the new price is similar to other drugs used for rare diseases.
Shrkeli also defended his small pharmaceutical company saying, “It really doesn’t make sense to get any criticism for this.”
This is not the first time the fledgling pharmaceutical executive has come under scrutiny.
He started the hedge fund MSMB Capital while in his 20's and was accused of urging the FDA to not approve certain drugs made by companies whose stock he was shorting.
In 2011, Shkreli helped form Retrophin, which also acquired old drugs and immediately raised their prices. Retrophin’s board fired Shkreli a year ago and has filed a complaint in Federal District Court, accusing him of using Retrophin as a personal fund to pay back angry investors in his hedge fund.
As for Shrkeli's claim that he will put the excess profits back into research, doctors say that isn't needed in this case.
“I certainly don’t think this is one of those diseases where we have been clamoring for better therapies,” said Dr. Wendy Armstrong, professor of infectious diseases at Emory University in Atlanta.

Update: Case dismissed! On Monday, October 17, District Judge John Grinsteiner rejected the “riot” charge that had been leveled against Amy Goodman for her coverage of a September 3 Dakota Access Pipeline protest. Standing before the Morton County courthouse, surrounded by supporters, Goodman said: “It is a great honor to be here today. The judge’s decision to reject the State’s Attorney Ladd Erickson’s attempt to prosecute a journalist—in this case, me—is a great vindication of the First Amendment.” And she added: “[W]e encourage all of the media to come here. We certainly will continue to cover this struggle.” Related Article The Arrest of Journalists and Filmmakers Covering the Dakota Pipeline Is a Threat to Democracy—and the Planet Josh Fox
This Monday morning, shortly after the sun rises over the small city of Mandan, North Dakota, the award-winning journalist, and host of Democracy Now!, Amy Goodman will walk into the Morton County–Mandan Combined Law Enforcement and Corrections Center and turn herself in to the local authorities. Her crime: good, unflinching journalism.
Goodman had the audacity to commit this journalism on September 3, when she was in North Dakota covering what she calls “the standoff at Standing Rock”: the months-long protests by thousands of Native Americans against the Dakota Access Pipeline. The $3.8 billion oil pipeline is slated to carry barrel after barrel of Bakken crude through sacred sites and burial grounds of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, and tribe members fear it could pollute the Missouri River, the source not only of their water but of millions of others’, should the pipe ever rupture. Their protests, which began in April and ballooned through the summer months, represent the largest mobilization of Native American activists in more than 40 years—and one of the most vital campaigns for environmental justice in perhaps as long. Goodman captured the scene as protesters were confronted by private security contractors wielding attack dogs and pepper spray.
Goodman’s arrival at the main protest site was significant. At the time, not a single one of the major American broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) had sent a reporter to cover the Standing Rock mobilization; none had even bothered to mention it on the air. But there was Goodman, standing at the edge of a grassy plain that was in the process of being churned into gullies of dirt, reporting on one of the most significant stories of the day. Clutching a large microphone, she captured the scene as hundreds of protesters tried desperately to stop a crew of bulldozers from tearing up the earth—the earth, they said, that belongs to nobody—only to be confronted by a force of private security contractors wielding attack dogs and pepper spray.
“People have gone through the fence, men, women, and children,” Goodman reported, her voice taut, then rising, louder and more intense. “The bulldozers are still going, and they’re yelling at the men in hard hats. One man in a hard hat threw one of the protesters down…!”
As Goodman narrated, a security contractor, burly in a deep blue shirt, could be seen belly-flopping a man onto the ground. Protesters streamed in to help him, stumbled over mounds of newly churned dirt, faced off with contractors whose faces were hidden behind oversized sunglasses. The scene was full of movement. Overhead, a helicopter hovered, circled, while back on the ground, protesters began to report burning eyes, and dogs—dogs lurching at protesters, dogs straining against their leashes, dogs with mouths open, mouths biting.
“Why are you letting the dog go after the protesters?” Goodman could be heard shouting at a security contractor as a woman screamed in the background. “It’s covered in blood!”
Within hours of the attack, Democracy Now! had turned its footage into a seven-minute video that it released as a web exclusive. Three days later, Goodman followed up with an extensive report—“Dakota Access Pipeline Co. Attacks Native Americans with Dogs and Pepper Spray”—that she broadcast live on her show. The video quickly went viral, pinging across Twitter and Facebook (where it was viewed more than 14 million times) and landing, ultimately, on the same big news stations that, until that moment, hadn’t bothered to cover the protests: CNN, CBS, NBC, NPR.
Goodman’s report created a rare crack in the consensus of silence. And, as Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi writes, the outrage it generated may well have influenced the Obama administration’s decision to halt work on the pipeline several days later. This was journalism that mattered.
Yet, on September 8, Goodman received the news that Morton County, North Dakota, had issued a warrant for her arrest. The charge: riot, a misdemeanor punishable by jail time and a fine.
It should be noted that this was not the original charge leveled against Goodman; initially, she was tagged with criminal trespassing, also a misdemeanor. But in what would seem to be a clear sign of charge-shopping, the prosecutor, Ladd Erickson, switched up the crimes she had allegedly committed just days before she was set to appear in court, because, he admitted in an e-mail to Goodman’s lawyer, there were “legal issues with proving the notice of trespassing requirements in the statute.”
When asked to explain the grounds for arresting a working journalist, Erickson told the Grand Forks Herald that he did not, in fact, consider Goodman a journalist. “She’s a protester, basically,” Erickson told the newspaper. “Everything she reported on was from the position of justifying the protest actions.” And in The Bismarck Tribune he later added, “I think she put together a piece to influence the world on her agenda, basically. That’s fine, but it doesn’t immunize her from the laws of her state.”
It’s worth pausing here for a moment to contemplate the full and chilling absurdity of this statement: According to Erickson, a woman who appeared at a protest carrying a microphone emblazoned with the name Democracy Now! and trailing a video crew; who can be heard in the resulting video report identifying herself to a security guard as a reporter; and who then broadcast the video on the daily news program she has hosted for 20 years is not actually a journalist. She is not a journalist, because she harbors a strong perspective, and that perspective clashes with his own. By the same distorted logic, every muckraking news gatherer from Ida Tarbell and Upton Sinclair on through I.F. Stone, and, yes, today’s Matt Taibbi (whose work Erickson apparently admires) was not a journalist but an activist flirting with arrest. Goodman’s report on the attack on the pipeline protesters created a rare crack in the consensus of silence.
This notion should disturb anyone who labors in the journalism trenches, particularly those who dedicate their days, and often nights, to covering stories that challenge the mighty and prick at the powerful. Engaging in serious journalism—journalism that captures a society’s forbidden, or simply hidden, stories—is hard and scary, and it requires bravery, conviction, and determination, along with an abiding faith in the protective power of the First Amendment. When that faith is compromised, the possibility of serious journalism collapses—a reason, no doubt, the Committee to Protect Journalists came out forcefully on Goodman’s behalf.
“This arrest warrant is a transparent attempt to intimidate reporters from covering protests of significant public interest,” Carlos Lauría, senior program coordinator for the Americas at CPJ, said in a statement. “Authorities in North Dakota should stop embarrassing themselves, drop the charges against Amy Goodman, and ensure that all reporters are free to do their jobs.”
Thus far, the North Dakota authorities remain committed to their own embarrassment; the charges have not been dropped, which is why Goodman is going back to North Dakota to turn herself in—and then fight the charges.
A few weeks back, as I drove with Goodman to and from a memorial service (full disclosure: Goodman is a family friend whom I have known for a long time and once worked for), I overheard an admirer of hers ask what the public could do to support her as she faced arrest. Goodman was quick to respond: keep paying attention to the protesters in North Dakota, keep caring about their fight. She, in other words, was not the story.
Goodman was right, of course. The long struggle of the Standing Rock Sioux, which is a struggle against broken treaties, environmental injustice, and government-sanctioned kleptomania, is older than this country and as essential to its future as it is to its past. Yet, without someone to hold a microphone to the activists’ lips or train a camera on their protests, the story often gets lost. We risk missing the message, uttered by a man with a raw voice and pained face, toward the end of Democracy Now!’s viral video: “No one owns this land. This land belongs to the earth. We are only caretakers. We’re caretakers of the earth.”
Note: This article has been updated to reflect the news that the charges against Goodman were switched from criminal trespassing to riot."

","GOP campaigners have called on senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley to resign through billboards that condemn them for supporting claims the 2020 election was “stolen”.
The billboard campaign, which launched on Thursday, targets 10 other Republicans who also rejected Joe Biden’s presidential election win when Congress voted on 6 January – hours after they came under attack by Donald Trump’s supporters with claims the election was “rigged”.
About $1 million (£729,000) has been spent on the billboard campaign, Politico reported, which has been set-up by the Republican Accountability Project (RAP), a group of former GOP officials who formed together in the days after the Capitol riot.
RAP has already committed to spend $50 million (£36 million) supporting GOP members of Congress who voted to impeach Mr Trump on 13 January, as well as senators who vote to convict him for “incitement of insurrection”.
That vote will follow a second impeachment trial in the Senate, which is set to begin on 8 February despite recent calls by Mr Cruz to “move on”.
One billboard by RAP says that Mr Cruz ""lied about the election. The Capitol was attacked. Sen. Cruz: Resign.” It is due to appear in his Texas constituency, with billboards also planned in major US cities.
Other Republicans targeted by the campaign include the House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, who met with Mr Trump in recent days, as well as a number of House Republicans who voted against the election results and Mr Trump’s impeachment.

Sarah Longwell, executive director of the Republican Accountability Project, told Politico that those targeted by the billboards are “people who are the most enthusiastic about lying to their constituencies about the election being stolen”.
“The goal is to not allow these officials to memory-hole the fact that they pushed this lie, which incited the attack on the Capitol,” said Ms Longwell.
“It took a lot of players within the Republican party to convince the vast majority of their voters that the election was fraudulent,” she added."

","A man who once claimed that the air in America was ""a little too clean for optimum health"", has been appointed to an advisory board of America's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Robert Phalen once claimed that children’s lungs need to breathe irritants so their bodies can learn to fight them.
The former director of the Air Pollution Health Effects Laboratory at the University of California Irvine was appointed to the agency’s critical Scientific Advisory Board by ​EPA Director Scott Pruitt.
Mr Pruitt has recently removed all the scientists who receive grant money from the agency.
Speaking to the the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2012, Mr Phalen told the audience: “Modern air is a little too clean for optimum health.”
Mr Phalen has also argued that the risks associated with modern particulate matter are “very small and confounded by many factors”.
In a 2004 study, he wrote that, “neither toxicology studies nor human clinical investigations have identified the components and/or characteristics of [particulate matter] that might be causing the health-effect associations”.

The appointment is part of Mr Pruitt’s plan to promote advisers who are “financially independent” from the agency.
He has barred scientists who receive grant money from the EPA from serving on its advisory boards, saying he will instead focus on “fresh perspectives” and “geographical representation”.
As a result, Mr Pruitt has placed 66 new experts on three different EPA scientific committees, according to the Washington Post. Several of these experts come from industries that the agency regulates. New advisers hail from companies such as Dow Chemical, Procter & Gamble, and the French petroleum company Total.
The committees also include current and former members of the American Chemistry Council – the primary trade and lobbying group for the chemical industry. Mr Pruitt is scheduled to give a speech the Council’s annual board meeting next week.

While Mr Pruitt says his new policy is meant to prevent conflicts of interest, others claim it will only promote them.
“Pruitt is turning the idea of ‘conflict of interest’ on its head,” Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Centre for Science and Democracy at the Union for Concerned Scientists, said in a statement. “He claims federal research grants should exclude a scientist from an EPA advisory board but industry funding shouldn’t.”"

progressive,"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/29/ted-cruz/ted-cruzs-pants-fire-claim-health-care-law-nations/
","To a man, the seven candidates on the stage at the Republican debate in Des Moines, Iowa, oppose Obamacare. When Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was asked what he would do for the millions of people who have gained health insurance thanks to the program, Cruz was quick to describe his take on the health care law’s failings.
""First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster,"" Cruz said. ""It is the biggest job-killer in this country. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.""
Virtually from the moment the Affordable Care Act was first debated, its critics have warned that it would wreck the economy. Those predictions, we found at least five times, were based on faulty evidence .
Now Cruz is claiming that the critics were right, and it all has come to pass.
Only that’s not true, either. At least in any way that the national data picks up.
The government’s labor surveys give us a pretty good window into the number of people working in any given month. They also count the number of people who are working part-time but would rather have full-time work . We looked at those tallies at several points in the life of Obamacare: When it passed, when its earliest changes took effect, when people first got insured under the law, and today.
The numbers run against Cruz’s statement.
Not only has the number of jobs gone up, but the number of unwilling part-timers has gone down. We used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to build this table:
April 2010 September 2010 January 2014 December 2015 Unemployment rate 9.9 9.5 6.6 5 Number of jobs (thousands) 139,297 139,396 Featured Fact-check Donald Trump's second impeachment ""cost $33 million."" 145,092 149,929 Unwilling part-timers (thousands) 9,178 9,246 7,250 6,022
All of the job numbers have moved in a positive direction since April 2010, the first full month after President Barack Obama signed the bill into law. The unemployment rate has moved steadily from 9.9 percent to 5 percent. The economy has added about 10.7 million jobs. And the number of working people who have part-time work but would rather have full-time work has fallen by nearly 3 million. There was a brief rise in that number between April and September 2010, but the longer term trend is clearly one of decline.
That’s not to say the Affordable Care Act deserves all the credit. The fact is many factors drive the labor market and the overall recovery from the Great Recession is the dominant player in this regard.
Still, economist Gary Burtless at the Brookings Institution said job growth has been steady and nearly all of it has been in full-time positions. The pattern, he said contradicts ""the prediction that the law would push employers to reduce the hours of their employees in order to avoid the law's penalties on employers who do not provide insurance to the full-time employees.""
""In the face of this evidence, critics of the Affordable Care Act keep telling us their predictions of the ‘job killing’ impacts of Obamacare have been borne out by experience,"" Burtless said. ""So far as I can see, this is flatly untrue.""
Maxim Pinkovskiy , an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, compared states that had very different starting points when Obamacare was passed. Pinkovskiy looked at Minnesota, a state with a low uninsurance rate, and Texas, where the uninsurance rate was relatively high. In his study, Texas was considered more exposed to the impacts of the Affordable Care Act because the law’s primary effect was to increase the number of insured people (despite Texas’ decision against expanding Medicaid).
Pinkovskiy found that in terms of jobs, Texas grew at a faster clip than Minnesota.
""More exposed states and counties have, if anything, experienced a rise in employment, salaries and output relative to less exposed areas with the implementation or the enactment of the ACA,"" Pinkovskiy wrote.
Bowen Garrett, an economist at the Urban Institute, co-authored a study with colleagues at the University of Illinois at Chicago that compared states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare and those that didn’t. The researchers found no predictable effect on labor market trends. Garrett told us that based on some economic models, it’s possible that the Affordable Care Act could have increased the number of part-time jobs by about 250,000.
""But that’s far from the millions some have claimed, and it’s not clear that the ACA is responsible,"" Garrett said.
A study in Health Affairs found no evidence that the law has led to more part-time work overall, but within certain groups -- people with little education and those 60-64 years old -- there might be a modest rise.
We reached out to the Cruz campaign and did not hear back.
Our ruling
Cruz said that Obamacare cost the country millions of jobs and had forced millions into working part-time.
The government’s employment surveys show no sign of that occurring. By every measure, millions more people are working and millions fewer are stuck unwillingly in part-time work since the time the Affordable Care Act became law. The law might have affected part-time work for certain kinds of people, but that didn’t change the improvement in the overall numbers.
Many of these numbers, especially the well-reported unemployment rate, are readily available and independent economic studies uncovered no sign that job growth has suffered at all under the new health care law.
Cruz turned familiar data upside down. We rate this claim Pants on Fire."
progressive,"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/6/18052374/florida-amendment-4-felon-voting-rights-results
","Florida voters during Tuesday’s midterm elections approved Amendment 4, automatically restoring voting rights in the state for people previously convicted of felonies.
Florida’s Amendment 4 restores voting rights for people in the state convicted of felonies as long as they have completed their sentences, although anyone convicted of murder or felony sex offenses would be excluded.
Based on the Sentencing Project’s 2016 estimates, this benefits more than a million people. The organization estimated in 2016 that nearly 1.5 million people in Florida have completed felony sentences but can’t vote — about 9.2 percent of the voting-age population in Florida. The total, though, includes some people convicted of murder and felony sex offenses, so not every one of those people benefits under Amendment 4.
Related 4 winners and 2 losers from the 2018 midterm elections
Black people, who are disproportionately arrested and incarcerated, will benefit the most. In 2016, more than 418,000 black people out of a black voting-age population of more than 2.3 million, or 17.9 percent of potential black voters in Florida, had finished sentences but couldn’t vote due to a felony record, according to the Sentencing Project. (Again, this includes some people convicted of murders and felony sex offenses.)
The amendment was officially supported by Floridians for a Fair Democracy, which gathered more than 1.1 million petitions to put it on the ballot. It received bipartisan endorsements from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Koch brothers–backed Freedom Partners.
Most states have at least some voting restrictions for people convicted of felonies. Most often, the law bars people who are currently in prison from voting. Some prohibit voting until a person finishes parole or probation, too.
Florida, however, barred people from voting even after they’ve completed their sentences. Only two other states — Kentucky and Iowa — currently do this. Virginia technically does under its Constitution, but former Gov. Terry McAuliffe and current Gov. Ralph Northam, both Democrats, have used their executive powers to restore voting rights to those convicted of felonies.
Only Maine and Vermont let people vote regardless of their criminal record, which means that people in the two states can even vote from prison.
Courts, including the US Supreme Court, have generally upheld such voting restrictions under the US Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which indicates that the government may abridge the right to vote due to “participation in rebellion, or other crime.”
In Florida, there was a process in place for getting voting rights restored. But the process, set up by Gov. Rick Scott (R), was very arduous. It required people to wait as long as seven years to apply, and the application review itself could take several additional years. Even after someone applied, restoration of voting rights was far from guaranteed: According to the Florida Commission on Offender Review, only 3,005 of more than 30,000 applicants had their voting rights restored through the system since Scott implemented it.
As a result, Florida had disenfranchised more potential voters than any other state, with more than 10 percent of all potential voters and more than 21 percent of potential black voters in Florida unable to vote due to felony records.
With Amendment 4’s win on Tuesday, that will now change — and more than 1 million people will get back the right to vote."

","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has condemned Republican leadership in the House of Representatives for assigning Marjorie Taylor Greene to an education committee despite her comments and social media posts appearing to believe school shootings were staged or “false flag” events.
“Assigning her to the education committee when she has mocked the killing of little children,” she said. ""When she has mocked the killing of teenagers … What could they be thinking? Or is thinking too generous of a word for what they might be doing.""
Recently uncovered Facebook posts from 2018 appear to show the newly elected Republican congresswoman from Georgia endorsing a conspiracy theory that the deadly mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida was a “false flag” event.
She also appeared to support posts from other users sharing conspiracies that the 9-11 attacks were “done by our own"" government and that ""none of the school shootings were real or done by the ones who were supposedly arrested for them"".
Ms Greene frequently has amplified far-right conspiracy theories and violence against elected officials on her social media page, including liking a comment in 2019 that said ""a bullet to the head would be quicker"" to remove Speaker Pelosi. (Following her primary election victory in 2020, Ms Green said she would “kick that b**** out of Congress).
In another comment from 2018, a user asked: ""Now do we get to hang them ?? Meaning H & O ???,"" in reference to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. She replied: ""Stage is being set. Players are being put in place. We must be patient. This must be done perfectly or liberal judges would let them off.""
A video from January 2020 shows Ms Greene following Parkland survivor and gun control advocate David Hogg in Washington DC.

School shooting survivors, their families and several lawmakers and gun control advocacy groups have demanded she resign.
On Wednesday, California House Rep Jimmy Gomez announced a resolution to expel her from Congress.
Her placement on education committees despite her comments is “absolutely appalling”, Speaker Pelosi told reporters on Thursday.
“What I’m concerned about is the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives, who is willing to overlook, ignore those statements,” she said."

","In case you missed it, Britain has a new leader of the opposition. The news media doesn’t know quite what to make of him, even though the major political story in the UK seems to reflect a resurgence from the left. Consider this: when Jeremy Corbyn threw his hat into the ring for the leadership of the Labour Party, the British media and even the liberal news outlets initially wrote him off as a fringe anti-establishment leftist candidate, out of touch with the political mainstream. He then proved all the experts wrong and won on the first ballot. In the US, another candidate largely dismissed by the media for being too liberal, Bernie Sanders, continues to draw huge crowds to his rallies. Meanwhile media outlets seem transfixed by the shiny empty object that is the Donald Trump campaign, not to mention the never-ending saga of Hillary Clinton’s email. The populist trend also consumes European countries like Greece and Spain, where leftist anti-corporate movements that have plenty in common with Corbyn and Sanders have burst onto the scene, not because of, but despite their treatment by mainstream news media.
One cannot blame the British news media for failing to predict Jeremy Corbyn’s victory. Even Corbyn himself, the slightly rumpled, unabashedly leftist candidate in a party that has grown more centrist in recent years, said that he did not expect to become the leader of Britain’s official opposition. In the immediate aftermath of his victory, Corbyn said that much of the media — and even the MPs — were out of touch with most voters’ daily lives.
“MPs are a bit cut off. But if I may say so, some of the editorial rooms in some of our broadsheet newspapers are even more cut off. They simply do not understand what’s going on out there. They just don’t get it.”
Jeremy Corbyn has a strong hand and has won a massive mandate, yet he is actually in a weak position when it comes to political capital, because he now finds himself surrounded in Parliament by the Labour Party, most of whom are quite despondent about the fact that he is their leader. He is also being scrutinized by the journalistic culture of Westminster, which will hold him to the same standards as other senior politicians who are more seasoned in the rules of the media game and the British political establishment. To say the least, he has a small margin for error in the realm in which he operates.
Corbyn’s success however comes about in part because of his slightly antagonistic relationship with the media. It appears that Corbyn has no media strategy at all; he simply appears to be disinterested in the press, and does not feel obliged to talk to them. By treating them so carelessly, he manages to expose their irrelevance to substantive reporting. The people who support Jeremy Corbyn are the same people who are distrustful of both the media agenda and the prevailing political culture in the UK. The fact that he did not try to placate the media right from the start built a certain level of respect for his platform, establishing his credibility in the eyes of the many people who are forming a new powerful voting bloc that fundamentally distrusts these institutions. British news consumers are left to wonder how much of Corbyn’s meager press coverage so far comes down to his lack of conventional media savvy in a country that has produced polished soundbite machines like David Cameron and Tony Blair. And how much of it comes down to plain old political ideology? Approximately forty percent of the British newspaper market is still controlled by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation. Seventy percent of all newspapers sold in the UK are considered right wing, and their influence goes well beyond newsstands.
Many young voters are saying that the media is obsessed with delivering the news in the old way: focusing only on the binary opposition between left and right without any consideration for the larger scope of issues they really care about. This attitude is rendering the old-fashioned media out of their list of news options. News media is molded to reward the confrontational candidate, and Corbyn or Sanders in their seemingly disarming approach are forcing the media to rethink the way it reports. It is through its traditional formality that media seeks to preserve its credibility. But in the larger picture of journalistic ethics, candidates like Corbyn and Sanders are stripping the credibility from mainstream news organizations by ridiculing the robotic formalities that serve their shallow analyses of the issues. They are forcing journalists to accept that some of the rules they assumed were an indispensable part of the game are no longer applicable in an anti-establishment political environment. Some of the conventional practices about polish, soundbite preparedness or political correctness need to be thrown out, at least when dealing with these candidates.
Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator trying to win the Democratic Party’s nomination for the White House, has a hill to climb, media-wise. His speeches are laden with socialist policies designed to bridge the expanding gap between the rich and poor in America. From the outset, despite attracting the largest crowds of all the other candidates, Sanders could not attract a proportionate amount of media attention. He is not just running against Hillary Clinton’s grandiose brand, he is also competing for media coverage against the Donald Trump campaign on the Republican side. Sanders constantly complains of the media obsession with, and addiction to, conflict and entertainment instead of the real policy issues that the country faces.
How does Sanders compare? He has only gotten a shocking total of 8 minutes on network news (about 1.5 percent). This is equivalent to the amount of time the news has devoted to Gov. Chris Christie (who is polling below 4 percent) and far less than the 43 minutes of coverage devoted to Jeb Bush, who is polling less than 10 percent.
The US media is infatuated with Donald Trump. The always-quotable billionaire is all over American airwaves and he is showing well in the polls, which might not be a coincidence given the overwhelmingly disproportionate coverage he has received. Trump is a polarizing figure, but he is just one of thirteen Republicans in a race for the White House, not to mention the Democrats and their candidates. There is no journalistic justification for the amount of attention the US media is giving The Donald other than, well, reality TV entertainment. I must admit I find it hard to stop watching the circus myself. Donald Trump is the poster boy for the relationship between the mainstream media and the entertainment culture, which rewards intellectual laziness and erodes political awareness. The one positive aspect about Donald Trump’s candidacy is that with his outrageous language and views (and his over-proportionate coverage because of both), he has made clear how much the culture of journalism has lost its engagement, journalistic integrity and ability to meaningfully dissect the monumental issues and policy challenges confronting the United States. As Bernie Sanders points out,
“The media is giving up to a large degree any pretense at serious journalism, and you’re moving into the trend of the USA Today — simple, and stupid, and color pictures,”
Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn have much in common. Both are old-school socialists whose policies are being reflected through the lenses of media outlets looking for a neo-liberalist approach to economics and more accustomed — even addicted — to the bombastic, theatrical brand of politics that a candidate like Donald Trump delivers. The members of the media find themselves explaining why these candidates are so popular and then dismissing their ideas as “fringe,” which is not an easy thing to do. It is in our nature to gravitate towards confirmation bias and sensationalism. It takes a certain force of will to consume information that might be boring, even if it is critical for making intelligent and informed political choices. We know why news works like this. Balance ratings, viewership and profit margins dictate that priority be given to topics that generate more buzz. Controversial candidates get more attention simply because they are damn good entertainment, but I’m afraid it is only just that. This is also why alternative sources of news media and other platforms are becoming much more important to an electorate that is looking not just to be entertained, but to be informed."

","A Republican candidate for the Maine State House who disparaged two teenage survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., dropped out of the race after drawing heavy criticism and challengers from both political parties.
The candidate, Leslie Gibson, had been running to represent District 57 in central Maine unopposed, according to The Sun Journal, which first reported the comments he made on Twitter. Mr. Gibson called one Florida student, Emma González, a “skinhead lesbian,” and another, David Hogg, a “moron” and a “baldfaced liar.”
Some state lawmakers, including at least two Republicans, were quick to condemn Mr. Gibson after his comments surfaced. Mr. Hogg issued a call on Twitter for someone to run against Mr. Gibson. By Thursday, two challengers who had been dismayed by the remarks were scrambling to complete the paperwork needed to run for the seat before the filing deadline that night.
By Friday, at least one Democrat, Eryn Gilchrist, and one Republican, Thomas H. Martin Jr., had entered the race and Mr. Gibson had withdrawn."

","That’s the appropriate use of the word “meddling.” It is not, however, an appropriate word to use when referring to the ongoing Russian attacks on American democracy that gained prominence in the 2016 presidential election and will accelerate as we head into the November midterms. This isn’t “Scooby-Doo.” The stakes couldn’t be higher, and the monsters we face are real.
President Trump’s news conference in Helsinki — in which he sided with a foreign despot who is continuing to use cyberweapons against the United States — makes this even more urgent.
AD
AD
Yes, I’ll admit — I, too, have used the phrase “election meddling” many times. My bad. Somehow, it became the default terminology for the deliberately destabilizing actions launched by the Kremlin to help Trump win and to sow chaos and division within the United States.
But that phrase is woefully inadequate. These continuing attacks are neither meddling nor “interference,” another euphemism. They’re a part of gibridnaya voyna — Russian for “hybrid warfare.” The best term for what we’re talking about would be “information warfare.”
One of the jarring realizations of the 21st century is that democratic governments are only as good as the quality of information that their voters receive. Influence the information flow voters receive, and you’ll eventually influence the government.
AD
In the past, the problem was uninformed voters. Today, the vortex of polarizing cable news (particularly Fox News) and the elevation of fringe nutcases into the mainstream on social media have caused millions to flip from uninformed to misinformed voters — who are far more dangerous. And in the 21st century, it’s pretty easy to use active disinformation operations to exploit these existing problems of misinformed voters and hyper-polarized politics. Russia has mastered that technique, bolstered further by hacking operations.
AD
The latest indictment from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III against agents of the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence unit, makes clear that these cyber-strategies are a military operation.
As Ofer Fridman points out in his book “Russian ‘Hybrid Warfare’: Resurgence and Politicization,” the concepts behind Russia’s digital attacks are not new. They trace their origins to long-forgotten Russian military theorists, such as Evgeny Messner, who understood that conventional military operations had limitations that could be overcome if complemented by unconventional tactics that don’t involve bullets or bombs.
AD
Destroying a tank has limited impact; you can always make another tank. But getting an enemy country to tear itself apart? Or getting its leaders to reorient the nation’s foreign policy virtually overnight? That does far more lasting damage.
It’s like the movie “Mean Girls,” except it’s in the White House. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)
In the Putin era, the Kremlin has certainly appreciated that insight. Contemporary scholars such as Igor Panarin have channeled Messner’s ideas, arguing that it is easier to weaken the United States by dividing Americans against themselves or by manipulating American political dynamics than it is to beat the United States on the battlefield. And while the direct political influence of such scholars is often overstated, their theoretical propositions have dovetailed with Russian cyber-operations abroad, which weaponize information flows to advance Kremlin goals.
AD
As Fridman explains, Panarin’s theory of information warfare refers to attempts to influence public opinion “in order to gain certain political benefits.” That influence can “be achieved by information manipulation, disinformation, fabrication of information, lobbying, blackmail,” all with the aim of changing the “decision-making processes of the adversary.”
AD
In other words, it’s not just about “divide and conquer”; it’s also about shifting government policy — sometimes by shifting who is in charge of the government.
The perfectly timed release of damaging, hacked information against Hillary Clinton likely contributed to Trump’s victory in the 2016 election. Trump himself understood how important those hacked documents were, which is why he mentioned WikiLeaks 164 times during the final month of the campaign.
AD
Others have suggested that Trump is compromised by the Kremlin directly or, at a minimum, highly vulnerable to Russian blackmail.
Whether that’s true or not, since being elected, Trump has actively divided Americans against one another while delivering key foreign policy victories to the Kremlin. Trump’s attacks and threats about NATO and his tariffs against Canada and the European Union have done more to advance Russian foreign policy goals than any other actions by a president in post-World War II history. And by continuing to suggest that Russia is not behind these information warfare attacks despite considerable evidence to the contrary, Trump is providing key political cover to Vladimir Putin. In doing so, he is facilitating the Kremlin’s ongoing information war against the United States.
AD
As Panarin put it, the aims of that military strategy include “a significant alteration of the direction of its internal or foreign policy” and “a replacement of the state’s leadership” with a regime loyal to Russia."

","Every single day across America, women seeking abortion and other forms of reproductive health care have to run a gauntlet of intimidation just to enter health clinics. Protesters, self-anointed street “counselors,” and religious fundamentalists bring gory signs and scream, often using high-decibel amplification equipment. They harangue and harass patients and staff, calling them “baby-killers” and promising them damnation. Clinic protesters feel righteous in their actions because they believe they are morally superior to the people seeking care, and they believe they have a right to impose their will on others. These and other tactics of intimidation are an integral part of the misogynistic, patriarchal arsenal of the “pro-life” movement, which every year in January hosts a “March for Life.” And every year, the march organizers bus students in from parochial schools across the country to ensure someone actually shows up. This year, they brought students from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky.
The students’ visit to D.C. did not end well.
In a now widely republished video, students from Covington Catholic, an all-male, virtually all-white, elite private school, taunted and mocked Nathan Phillips, a Native elder from the Omaha Nation and former U.S. Marine. Phillips was in D.C.—which like much of the United States is land from which indigenous peoples were forcibly removed—to attend the first Indigenous People’s March, a gathering of prayers, songs, dances, and speeches, calling attention to the global injustices perpetuated against indigenous peoples. While trying to intercede in what he believed to be an escalating situation between a large and increasingly rowdy group of at least 60 white teen boys and five Black men, he walked between the two groups, drumming in an effort to defuse the rising tension. Phillips then came face to face with Nick Sandmann, the young man who became an instant and iconic image of white entitlement exhibited by him and his classmates.
What happened next is telling: In short, Phillips’ testimony about an incident in which a very large group of raucous boys surrounded him and acted with extreme disrespect is being ignored in favor of an after-the-fact narrative created by white teens from a virtually all-white school with a history of blatant and public racism. The boys’ narrative also is being amplified by white journalists, further disrespecting the Native elder and discounting the accounts of eyewitnesses at the scene. This discounting of experience is familiar to many of us: the women who seek reproductive health care who are effectively told we should endure abuse, the Native elder on sacred ground being made the “aggressor” as the only adult who tries to intervene in a situation, the people of color who constantly have largely male, majority-white media telling them “there’s more to the story” of their abuse than what they say. It’s the same story, different characters that we saw played out just recently in the U.S. Supreme Court hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, who also attended an elite Catholic school and whose alleged actions many defended as an example of “boys being boys.” White boys, of course.
The entire incident reads like the script of a remake we’ve seen too many times before. The initial video showing a large group of boys being aggressive and disrespectful to Phillips exploded across the internet and drew outrage. Then, new videos purporting to show “other perspectives” (including helpful offers by #MAGA followers on Twitter to send me their “spliced videos” showing the “true picture”) were circulated. This was followed by a letter ascribed to Sandmann that effectively blamed Phillips for the entire incident, stating: “He waded into the crowd, which parted for him. I [Sandmann] did not see anyone try to block his path. He locked eyes with me and approached me, coming within inches of my face. He played his drum the entire time he was in my face.”
The letter was disseminated by RunSwitch, a Kentucky-based PR firm. One of the three founding partners of RunSwitch is Scott Jennings, a conservative commentator, and a former political operative who worked for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, George W. Bush, and other Republican politicians.
I watched at least five of the initial short videos shot by different people (several posted below), and there was no question as to what I saw: a large unsupervised group of boys, acting entitled and out of control. They had come from an event that is focused on controlling women’s lives, choices, and bodies. Indeed, a group of them harassed a young woman before the incident with Phillips. And another suggested that rape “is not rape if you enjoy it.” The young men who’d just come from the “March for Life” were directly mimicking their movement’s views on the agency of women by harassing young women and discounting rape. In other words, in their eyes women deserve no agency.
The boys were wearing #MAGA hats, “March for Life” sweatshirts, and toting bottles of “Trump water,” which in several videos they can be seen proudly exhibiting to others around them. Though they were high school students, they appeared to have no adult supervision, but for one lone adult who stood at the back of this large pack of boys and did … nothing. Indeed, in a nearly two hour video, Phillips was the only adult I saw who tried to intervene in what clearly appeared to be an escalating and potentially dangerous situation. If I had been there, I would have done the same.
In the videos, it is clear the boys surrounded and hemmed in a Native elder, laughing, chanting, “war whooping,” and at various times doing “tomahawk chops” right in Phillips face. Hunter Hooligan, who attended the Indigenous People’s March to honor her Mvskoke family, wrote in The Cut: “Nathan stopped walking, but he kept singing and playing his drum — staring right into the smirking boy’s eyes. We all huddled around him as the other boys began to push, prod, and bump us into a tighter and tighter cluster. They were mocking Nathan’s sacred music with purposefully disrespectful dancing and a perverted imitation of his singing. Their imitations were the racist tropes of ‘Indian chants’ — the stereotypical grunting and ‘hiyahiyahiyas’ of representations past.” Her personal testimony appears not to have been read by many of the Covington Catholic boys’ apologists.
But all it took was the mournful letter written by a right-wing PR firm to change the situation. Almost immediately after “the other side” letter was released, the white-washing began. White journalists across the internet paused for a collective white sympathy moment, writing mea culpas at having “misread the situation.”
Robby Soave of Reason claimed that the media had “wildly mischaracterized” what happened. Jake Tapper tweeted his piece, without indicating whether he’d personally looked into whether Soave’s position had merit.

Phillips did not ""march straight into the middle of the group of young people,"" and the boys did not ""tentatively join in his chanting."" Dozens of boys were taunting five Black Hebrew Israelites, Phillips walked in between, and the students enveloped him. https://t.co/W7QxZ180uf — Max Kennerly (@MaxKennerly) January 20, 2019
John Harwood and S.E. Cupp tweeted mournfully that they’d wished they’d waited for more information. Michael Cohen of the Boston Globe complained on Twitter about lost nuances, and Sam Stein of the Daily Beast asserted “it was a tricky story to unpack.” In other words, those of us who saw this scene for what it was, a pack of entitled, racist boys taunting a Native elder were engaged in “motivated reasoning.” In the Atlantic, Julie Irwin Zimmerman wrote about how she “failed the Covington Catholic Test.""
I hated the MAGA hats some of the kids were wearing, their listless tomahawk chops, the way some of their chanting mocked Phillips’s. But I also saw someone with Phillips yelling at a few of the kids that his people had been here first, that Europeans had stolen their land. While I wouldn’t disagree, the scene was at odds with the reports that Phillips and those with him were attempting to calm a tense situation. As I watched the longer videos, I began to see the smirking kid in a different light. It seemed to me that a wave of emotions rolled over his face as Phillips approached him: confusion, fear, resolve. He finally, I thought, settled on an expression designed to mimic respect while signaling to his friends that he had this under control. Observing it, I wondered what different reaction I could have reasonably hoped a high-school junior to have in such an unfamiliar and bewildering situation. I came up empty.
“Listless tomahawk chops?” Of course Zimmerman “began to see the smirking kid in a different light.” That was the point of the PR effort in the first place. Poor young white boy trying to stave off 60 of his best friends yelling and chanting disrespectfully by staring down a Native elder and—really—just praying for peace. It’s as though the PR firm had cast a spell.
In an effort to figure out what had actually happened, I watched the nearly two hour video taken by a member of the Black Hebrew Israelites three separate times. And here is what I saw.
In the first hour of the video, four members of the fringe Black Hewbrew Israelites sect are standing well in front of (not on, as Sandmann claimed) the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on the patio that leads to the reflecting pool. They were facing the Washington Monument, away from the memorial steps. They never moved from this spot. Black Hebrew Israelites, which the Southern Poverty Law Center says includes a small extremist element, believe that African Americans, not Jews, are the real descendants of Israel. They often engage in street preaching in places like New York City and D.C. They are homophobic, racist, and misogynistic. They can be verbally abusive but, as police in New York attest, they are not generally physically dangerous. Most people ignore them.
In the long video, hundreds of people do just that… either walk right by them, or mill around listening for a while and then walk away. At one point in the first hour, two women engage them in an argument for a few minutes and then walk away. In that first hour, the Hebrew Israelites appear to get agitated by a skateboarder who circles them purposefully over and over, clearly there to taunt them, and indeed the skateboarder is the only one with whom they engage directly. One of the Hebrew Israelites suggests getting a “MAGA hat for this Republican,” referring to the skateboarder.
At 59:09, the video pans to the steps of the memorial, well behind the Hebrew Israelites and it’s clear that sometime in the prior 15 minutes or so, a large group of the Covington Catholic High School teens has assembled there. The Hebrew Israelites still have their back to the steps. The man making the video says, “Take a look at these Make America Great Again crackers,” apparently referring to the large group.
While the Hebrew Israelites face the Washington monument, the teens jeer from behind them. At 1:04:00, a homeless man wanders past and exchanges words with the Black Hebrew Israelites. At 1:05:00, it is clear that the group of teens behind the Hebrew Israelites has grown much larger and they begin to further engage the Black Hebrew Israelites by yelling from behind them, catcalling them; one of the Hebrew Israelites turns around at 1:06:00 to engage the boys briefly and turns back. The students continue to talk to the Hebrew Israelites from the steps. At about 1:08:00 the Covington Catholic students start chanting and jeering, though it is hard to hear what they are saying. At 1:09:51, a student runs down the stairs to face the others. He throws off his jacket, sweatshirt, and t-shirt, and naked from the waist up, starts jumping up and down and leading some sort of loud and grunting chant. The Black Hebrew Israelites never leave the spot they have been at this entire time.
Then the crowd of teens gets even rowdier. They are clearly taunting the Black men. Some of the teens move onto the patio and closer to the men, who still for the most part face away from them, talking to others. The teens are dancing and chanting. Then suddenly they huddle. At around 1:12:20 you can hear faint drumming of Phillips walking slowly into the picture, a distance away from the stairs.
Sandmann claims in his letter that “The protestor everyone has seen in the video began playing his drum as he waded into the crowd, which parted for him.” First of all, Phillips was not a “protestor.” Second, this is clearly not what happens in the video. Instead as Hooligan wrote, the teens surround Phillips and start hopping, chanting, chopping hands, laughing. By 1:13:00 there is a very large crowd of teens surrounding Phillips; they are openly mocking him. There’s nothing respectful about it. If there is a chaperone or teacher around the vicinity, it is not obvious, and if as Sandmann asserts, they asked for and received permission from a teacher to do what they in fact did…well then, as a parent, I am aghast.
The Hebrew Israelites video focuses back on the teens who move closer to the Hebrew Israelites, some clearly taunting them again. Finally at 1:17:17 someone yells for the students to back up, but instead they quickly re-converge around and engage the Hebrew Israelites at which point the Hebrew Israelites themselves ask the teens several times to step back. From there until the end of the video, the Black Hebrew Israelites and teens are talking back and forth until it appears they leave.
Sandmann’s letter states: “I never felt like I was blocking the Native American protestor. He did not make any attempt to go around me. It was clear to me that he had singled me out for a confrontation, although I am not sure why.”
But as this video shared on Twitter by Waleed Shahid shows, Phillips was surrounded by jumping, whooping, mocking teens. As you can see in the frame below, Sandmann is in the background (red cap, gray jacket) smiling. It does not appear to me that Phillips “singled him out” for confrontation. That assertion also appears to be a lie.

Hunter Hooligan’s video shows the same. A very large crowd of very rude boys surrounding a sole Native elder.
There are so many levels of racism here, I am not sure where to start. First, note that in staring down an elder, Sandmann suggests that Phillips should go around him, rather than making way for the elder to pass. Second, contrary to what Zimmerman claims, the tomahawk chops are not listless or innocent. They are directly insulting to indigenous people. In the 2012 Massachusetts senate race, staffers for then-Sen. Scott Brown were caught on video using the tomahawk chop and war whoops to mock Elizabeth Warren, who later defeated Brown. The principal chief of the Cherokee Nation called Brown’s staffers’ use of the gesture “offensive and racist.” The incident almost certainly played a role in Brown’s defeat.
As L.V. Anderson wrote in Salon, “[T]he tomahawk chop and the war chant have little basis in Native American history. There is no indication that Native Americans ever made the gesture known today as the tomahawk chop. Tomahawks were historically not only used as weapons by Native Americans but also revered as sacred objects.”
Professional sports teams throughout the country have been under fire for almost two decades to abandon their use of Native imagery and caricature for their own gain. David Waldstein, writing in the New York Times about the Cleveland Indians “Chief Wahoo” symbol, that “The logo has long been the source of anguish and frustration for those who consider it offensive, outdated and racist, but for many of the team’s fans it is a cherished insignia — a divide that has played out at all levels of sports in recent years with teams featuring such nicknames and insignias. Most universities have stopped using Native American nicknames, while other teams, like the Washington Redskins in the N.F.L., have resisted growing pressure to do so.”
For journalists and others who consider themselves “informed,” to not tie this incident and the treatment of Phillips to the broader effort by indigenous people to reclaim dignity stolen from them in a culture laden with white supremacy is some “motivated reasoning” indeed.
Then there’s the blaming of the Hebrew Israelites for the boys’ behavior. The letter from RunSwitch states:
When we arrived, we noticed four African American protestors who were also on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. I am not sure what they were protesting, and I did not interact with them. I did hear them direct derogatory insults at our school group. The protestors said hateful things. They called us “racists,” “bigots,” “white crackers,” “faggots,” and “incest kids.” They also taunted an African American student from my school by telling him that we would “harvest his organs.” I have no idea what that insult means, but it was startling to hear.
The Hebrew Israelites were not, as I have noted above, on the steps. Wherever they were, however, is immaterial, because it does not excuse the behavior of this large pack of boys, nor the absence of any adult supervision. In effect, they are blaming five Black men for the behavior of 60-odd male teens who were free to and should have left the scene. Ironically, “racist” and “bigot” fit the actions of Covington Catholic students in other public venues. How else, for example to explain this video of boys at a high school basketball game, in full view of parents and coaches, wearing blackface and body paint, caricaturing Black students on the opposing team? (The original has now been deleted by Covington Catholic but has been uploaded by others.) Or this photo:
I am not sure I see the nuance here. The notion that this was OK at a formal school function tells us all we need to know about the lessons these kids learn from their parents, “teachers,” coaches, and community. The same lessons Kavanaugh got: Act with impunity because we will protect you.
That impunity is what the country saw during the Kavanaugh hearings. It is what we see every time a white police officer or other agent of the state goes uncharged or is acquitted for killing an unarmed person of color. It is what we see and hear in the rush to show sympathy and find “nuance” in the actions of entitled white boys and men, and in the dismissal of the experience of a Native elder. It is what women see every day in trying to access health care. Intimidate with impunity, and we will protect you.
The only “motivated reasoning” that’s been deployed is by those who find a need to excuse male white behavior, no matter what.
As Zerlina Maxwell, a political analyst and director of political programming as Sirius.XM, said on Twitter, we know what that smirk all too well.
I can’t get the maga kid’s face out of my head bc it’s so familiar. That smug look is my childhood and I’m not the only one.
White journos spending today doing detailed tick tocs might want to interview a Black or Brown person about why it resonated. That’s part of the story. — Zerlina Maxwell (@ZerlinaMaxwell) January 21, 2019

Joe Biden's attack on fossil fuel goes faster, further than anyone expected It has left the oil industry stunned Photo by Reuters/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo
Article content Oil and gas companies knew they would face a fight with President Joe Biden, who had campaigned on tackling climate change. Nobody expected fossil fuel to come under such an immediate attack. Biden didn’t quietly sidetrack the Keystone XL pipeline with legal manoeuvres. The new president yanked the permit on his very first day in office, blocking a project that would have delivered crude from Alberta’s oilsands before even speaking to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Joe Biden's attack on fossil fuel goes faster, further than anyone expected Back to video He didn’t simply rejoin the Paris climate pact, as he promised during the campaign, but had his climate adviser, Gina McCarthy, commit Wednesday to “the most aggressive” carbon cut the U.S. can make. That came just before Biden signed a climate-related executive order suspending new oil and gas leases on public lands, directing federal agencies to purchase electric cars by the thousands and seeking to end fossil-fuel subsidies.

Article content It all left the oil industry stunned on what the Biden team had pitched as Climate Day. Fossil fuel stocks have plunged on his actions, and banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have warned of a drop in U.S. crude supplies. “The industry is aghast at these changes,” Dan Eberhart, chief executive of oil-field services company Canary Drilling Services, said in an interview. “They are more direct, more fierce and quicker than what folks expected.” More On This Topic How Joe Biden's anti-oil policies may be good for Canada's energy sector after all Joe Oliver: Trudeau paved the way for Biden’s rejection of Keystone Jack M. Mintz: Canada should retaliate against Biden's wrong-headed decision to cancel Keystone. Here's how Taken together, Biden has moved faster on climate and clean energy than his former boss, President Barack Obama, who took office in 2009 under the strain of a similarly severe economic crisis. More orders will likely follow, along with legislation. Biden’s actions to date, and his far-reaching goals, reflect how much has changed in the past four years. While the Obama era ended with a fracking boom that transformed the U.S. as a top energy exporter, the Biden era has started with sharp moves against fossil fuel. Next Biden wants to eliminate net greenhouse gas emissions from power plants by 2035, a timetable some utility executives consider too difficult and expensive to meet. Climate activists are now waging a ” war on gas,” fighting pipelines and pushing cities to ban the fuel’s use in new buildings — and Biden’s early moves align with these goals.

Article content “In my view we’ve already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis,” Biden said in his speech Wednesday that elevated global heating to an “existential threat” with national security consequences. His immediate actions will make easier the job of his climate envoy, former Secretary of State John Kerry, as the U.S. seeks to regain the respect and trust of world and re-establish itself as a climate leader. On Wednesday, Kerry expounded on the new administration’s policies in a video address to members the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, warning that gas pipelines risk becoming “stranded assets” in three decades or less. While some executives may balk at Biden’s timeline, large utility companies have been making their own public plans to neutralize their carbon emissions by mid-century. This group includes Duke Energy Corp. and Dominion Energy Inc., giant companies with much at stake under Biden’s climate agenda. Biden is also weaving climate considerations into decision-making across the federal government, not just a handful of departments, under an order signed Wednesday that makes global warming a pillar of U.S. policy in both foreign and national affairs. His directives established a National Climate Task Force, with members drawn from 21 federal departments and agencies. The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions nonprofit group, said Biden’s order demonstrate a “whole-of-government approach to tackling the climate challenge.”

Article content Many clean-energy companies prospered during President Donald Trump’s tenure, despite his oil-friendly policies and his promised to exalt America’s fossil fuel “energy dominance.” In less than a month under the Biden administration, the speed and range of policy moves appear to be a huge potential boost, both for their industry and the jobs it can provide. Wielding the federal government’s vast purchasing power to buy carbon-free electricity and zero-emission vehicles made in the U.S. now promise additional inputs for surging growth. Americans bought or leased 172,000 electric cars in the first three quarters of 2020, compared to 235,000 for all of the previous year, according to data from BloombergNEF. “I’ve always said that clean energy growth is inevitable, but the speed, scale and equity of that growth is driven by policy investment,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association lobbying group. The U.S. installed more than 14.5 gigawatts of solar power in 2020, according to BloombergNEF, up from 25 per cent from the year before. Clean-energy firms that went relatively unknown for years have soared since Biden’s election, with many now selling more shares than ever to capitalize on the moment. Oil and gas companies warn their own industry’s jobs will be sacrificed in the process, at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has already crippled the U.S. economy. Biden’s speech on Wednesday sought to address those anxieties. “They helped build this country,” he said of fossil-fuel workers. “We’re never going to forget the men and women who dug the coal and built the nation. We’re going to do right by them, make sure they have opportunities to keep building the nation in their own communities and getting paid well for it.”

Article content But those promises won’t mask the risks facing large parts of the economy. “A federal leasing moratorium is effectively a blockade around New Mexico’s economy,” said Ryan Flynn, president of the New Mexico Oil & Gas Association, in statement predicting a rise in unemployment coupled with falling state revenue. To climate advocates, however, the lease moratorium comes as a needed correction after the Trump administration tried to open up more of the country and its coastal waters to drilling. Biden on his first day signed an order suspending oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge–a move that followed on the heels of the Trump administration finalizing nine leases there. “After years of giving away oil and gas leases at fire-sale prices, tapping the brakes is a sensible and necessary step,” said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund nonprofit group. “With industry already sitting on more than 13 million acres of idle oil and gas leases, claims that a pause on leasing will cause economic harm stretch all credulity.” Bloomberg.com

Americans are blessed to live in a nation where cable companies can't charge consumers extra money to access Netflix or block them from reading the New York Times online just for the heck of it. But telecom companies sure seem like they want that power, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is now chaired by a former Verizon lawyer and internet-service-provider lackey. This week, Ajit Pai openly said he wants to end so-called net neutrality rules enacted under the Obama administration, which guarantee that telecoms can't lump websites into ""packages"" and charge customers to access various tiers, as is done with cable TV — which everyone, including most working-class Republicans, hates.
Thus, information-loving Americans must now hope their federal legislators fight Pai's FCC and pass laws defending net neutrality. This battle requires the help of lawmakers who are not monsters and shills for telecom companies — and two Miami lawmakers, Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, appear to be both. Here's why you should call them to demand they enforce net neutrality.
Marco Rubio has repeatedly tried to kill net neutrality laws.
In March 2015, when the FCC moved to protect net neutrality under Obama, Politico published an op-ed by Rubio titled ""Government Is Crashing the Internet Party,"" which was immediately mocked. The piece included passages such as this one:
First, while the FCC plan supposedly seeks to prevent ISPs from playing favorites, it does so by giving that power to another entity: government. This is illogical, particularly because the federal government is adept at rigging the economy in favor of powerful interests. The answer to correcting injustice in an economy is to increase consumer power, not government power. Second, the issue of ISPs creating different speed lanes is not the injustice that it is made out to be. There are hardly any cases of it to begin with, and any deals that do take place are just as likely to benefit consumers by allowing highly trafficked sites to accommodate their visitors. This is why FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, who voted against the plan, called it “a solution that won’t work to a problem that doesn’t exist.”
Ah, yes: Slowing access to websites is actually good! And cable companies don't want to do that anyway! They promised! Teacher would never lie to us! (As is the case with all of Lil Marco's op-eds, this one was predictably rebutted line-by-line on the internet.)
But he didn't stop there: In 2016, Rubio cosponsored the Orwellian ""Restoring Internet Freedom Act,"" which would have rescinded the FCC's protections had it not been a transparently evil bill that even his colleagues were too afraid to pass. He reintroduced the same bill again this year.
Oh, and he's accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from the telecom industry.
You can reach Marco Rubio's office by dialing 202-224-3041.
Mario Diaz-Balart is an OG net neutrality hater.
As early as 2006, before the phrase ""net neutrality"" grew into the household term it is today, Diaz-Balart was still voting against protecting the internet against meddling telecoms.
Then, in 2011, House Republicans tried to sneakily defund the FCC's neutrality provisions by amending another bill to include passages stripping money from the FCC. That plan, though devious, ultimately failed. But Diaz-Balart was one of the GOP members most staunchly in favor of the idea.
“If you believe that the miracle of innovation [the Internet] took place... because the government got out of its away , you would support this amendment,” he said that year, according to Politico.
Oh, and he's also accepted tens of thousands of dollars from the telecom industry.
Call Mario Diaz-Balart's Washington office at 202-225-4211.
So what about everyone else?
Call them too. Call Miami Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who tends to be more moderate than Rubio and Diaz-Balart but still voted in line with them earlier this year to let cable companies sell your private data without your consent. Call Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen even though she's the most moderate Republican of the bunch. Hell, call Sen. Bill Nelson and Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Frederica Wilson too even though they're Democrats. Call everybody.
Reach Curbelo at 202-225-2778, Ros-Lehtinen at 202-225-3931, Nelson at 202-224-5274, Wasserman Schultz at 202-225-7931, and Wilson at 202-225-4506."

","Oklahoma state Sen. Ralph Shortey is facing numerous charges from Moore police after he was caught in a Super 8 Motel room with a minor boy.
According to KOCO reporter Bret Buganski‏, police are recommending the Republican lawmaker be charged with soliciting prostitution of a minor, prostitution within 1,000 feet of church and transporting purpose of prostitution.
""On March 9 ... officers of the Moore Police Department were contacted in reference to a welfare check at a local hotel,"" Lt. Kyle Dudley told NewsOK.com. ""Responding officers found a juvenile male in a hotel room which was also occupied by an adult male. The circumstances surrounding this incident are currently under investigation and no additional information can be released at this time.""
An employee of the hotel confirmed to KOCO that a man named ""Ralph Allen Shortey"" checked in at approximately 12:20 a.m. asking for a room with two beds. Just 30 minutes later the police arrived responding to a ""welfare check,"" though no one has come forward admitting to the call.
No one has been arrested and no charges have been filed, but text messages between the boy and Shortey are being investigated by police. Shortey's legislative office door was found to have a note saying that he would be gone for the week.
Shortey was the state chair of President Donald Trump's campaign during the primary elections.
""I am proud and honored to have been tapped as Chairman of the campaign for Oklahoma,"" Shortey wrote on his Facebook Sept. 2015, according to The Lost Ogle. ""We are very excited for the opportunity to have Mr. Trump here,"" he said announcing a rally for Trump at the Oklahoma State Fair.
Shortey has been in office since 2010 and is most known for a bill he proposed to ban fetuses in food. NewsOK reports Shortey has been married to his high school sweetheart since 2002 and that he studied at Heartland Baptist Bible College in Oklahoma City in preparation for mission work in Uganda. A direct mail piece sent to Shortey's constituents show that he was also endorsed by Sheriff Joe Arpaio for his opposition to immigration and immigrants and by Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) for his ""conservative principles."" Beth and Dog the Bounty Hunter hosted a rally for Shortey's election in 2014.
“The Oklahoma Republican Party takes all accusations against elected officials seriously, especially when the welfare of a minor is involved,"" Pam Pollard of the Oklahoma Republican Party said in a statement. ""We have reached out to Senator Shortey for comment and have not heard back from him at this time. We await the report from law enforcement on whether charges will be filed.""

Walter Shaub, the former director of the US Office of Government Ethics who now serves as a senior director focusing on ethics issues for the Campaign Legal Center, wants the Trump administration, its surrogates, and its allies to back off from what the center refers to as “their attempt to undermine the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller.”
Noting efforts by the president’s lawyer, Jay Sekulow, and others to “muddy the waters and impede Mueller’s investigation,” the center issued a statement Friday from Shaub, in which he said:
The coordinated effort by President Trump and his surrogates to discredit the Mueller investigation raises serious alarms. Rather than making themselves complicit in this assault on the rule of law, Members of Congress should send a clear message to the President that firing Mueller is a red line he must not cross.
Shaub is right about the red line. If Trump fires Mueller, as many now speculate is possible, the United States will find itself in a constitutional crisis—where the executive branch rejects scrutiny, checks and balances, and the rule of law in order to protect itself from accountability. The expert on government rights and wrongs is so concerned that—after a Trump-aligned member of the House, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, appeared on CNN and announced: “I call on my Republican colleagues to join me in the firing of Bob Mueller”—Shaub wrote: “Make a plan folks. Be ready to take to the streets. This is an attack on our Republic.”
Taking it to the streets is always a good idea when the oligarchs and plutocrats spin out of control. That’s why the founding generation of the American experiment established First Amendment rights to assemble and to petition for the redress of grievances. But it is important, now, before a potential crisis becomes a real one, to signal what that reaction will be. The firing of “is a red line [Trump] must not cross.” —Walter Shaub Jr.
Citizens need to know what they will demand when they assemble and petition for the redress of grievances.
So what’s the right demand? If a president attacks the Republic, there is one correct and necessary response: impeachment. Current Issue View our current issue
When the Constitutional Convention of 1787 outlined the impeachment power, there was a good deal of clarity as regards when and how it should be employed. It was to serve as a check and balance on the executive branch in general, and on president’s in particular. “No point is of more importance than that the right of impeachment should be continued,” argued George Mason. This check on presidential abuses of power provided an answer to the questions that vexed Mason: “Shall any man be above Justice? Above all shall that man be above it, who can commit the most extensive injustice?”
Some members of Congress recognize their duty in these times to answer those questions with a clear commitment to hold this president to account. Congressmen such as Tennessee Democrat Steve Cohen, the ranking Democrat on the Constitution subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, and California Democrat Brad Sherman, have proposing impeachment resolutions—with an appropriate focus on concerns about presidential obstruction of justice, and with an appropriate sense of urgency. But when Texas Democrat Al Green raised the issue of impeachment in the House this month, his motion was tabled on a 364-58 vote.
Top Democrats joined House Republicans in voting to table Green’s motion, with House minority leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Democratic whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland releasing a joint statement that read:
Legitimate questions have been raised about his fitness to lead this nation. Right now, Congressional committees continue to be deeply engaged in investigations into the President’s actions both before and after his inauguration. The special counsel’s investigation is moving forward as well, and those inquiries should be allowed to continue. Now is not the time to consider articles of impeachment.
Supporters of a robust system of checks and balances were disappointed by the caution Pelosi and Hoyer displayed. But the attention the Democratic leaders paid to Mueller’s inquiry establishes a red line of the sort Shaub describes.
Pelosi and Hoyer have always been cautious about the “I” word. But if Trump fires Robert Mueller, there will be no more room for caution. And one of the best ways to defend the Mueller inquiry is for House Democrats to make it clear at this point that—while they are, indeed, a minority in the House and Senate, and while they surely face the obstacle of House Speaker Paul Ryan’s partisanship-over-principle approach to governing—their response to the firing of Mueller would be an absolute and unequivocal demand for the impeachment of Donald Trump."

","As news of Iran’s release of American prisoners spread, Republicans were quick to deny President Barack Obama much credit for the deal.
Presidential candidate Marco Rubio said the United States should not have made any concessions to Iran. Part of the deal included Obama granting clemency to seven Iranians charged in U.S. courts with violating economic sanctions against Iran.
""Our enemies now know that if you can capture an American, you can get something meaningful in exchange for it,"" Rubio said on Meet the Press on Jan. 17, 2016.
Host Chuck Todd pressed Rubio on that position: ""So under President Rubio, you would not have negotiated any sort of prisoner exchange for those four American hostages?""
Rubio replied: ""When I become president of the United States, our adversaries around the world will know that America is no longer under the command of someone weak like Barack Obama, and it will be like Ronald Reagan, where as soon as he took office the hostages were released from Iran.""
We flagged Rubio’s comment as a misleading framing of history. Reagan’s inauguration in 1981 may have coincided with the release of the hostages, but historians say it did not cause it. Instead, the Iranians had tired of holding the hostages, and that the administration of Jimmy Carter did the legwork to get the hostages released.
We asked the Rubio campaign for response but did not hear back.
The hostage crisis of 1979
It’s a GOP talking point we’ve debunked before. In 2012, Republican candidate Mitt Romney said, ""I believe the right course is what Ronald Reagan called peace through strength ... There's a reason why the Iranians released the hostages on the same day and at the same hour that Reagan was sworn in."" We rated his claim Pants on Fire.
In 1979, Islamic revolutionaries overthrew the Shah of Iran, who had been installed and supported by successive U.S. administrations. Militants took over the American embassy and held 52 American hostages from Nov. 4, 1979, until Jan. 20, 1981 -- the day Carter passed the reins to Reagan, who had defeated him amid widespread public disapproval of Carter’s handling of the crisis.
But negotiations for the hostages’ release started well before Election Day. In September 1980, the Iranians contacted the Carter administration with a proposal, according to Gary Sick, a Columbia University professor and the author of October Surprise: America's Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan.
The agreement that led to the release involved $11 billion to $12 billion in Iranian assets that Carter had frozen 10 days after the seizure of the U.S. embassy. Sick told us that the Iranians feared having to start negotiations over with a new administration and believed that they had extracted most of the benefits from holding the hostages.
Carter informed Reagan at 8:31 a.m. that the release of the hostages was imminent, according to a contemporary report in the New York Times . ""The hostages, whose 14 months of captivity had been a central focus of the presidential contest last year, took off from Tehran in two Boeing 727 airplanes at 12:25 p.m., Eastern standard time, the very moment that Mr. Reagan was concluding his solemn Inaugural Address at the United States Capitol,"" its report says. Reagan announced the news at 2:15 p.m. at a luncheon with congressional leaders in the Capitol’s Statuary Hall. So Reagan, not Carter, got to bask in the glow of the hostages’ safe return.
Despite the showy announcement, scholars of the period say that Reagan did not play any significant role in freeing the hostages.
""Well before Reagan became president, the deal for releasing the hostages had already been worked out by the Carter administration's State Department and the Iranians, ably assisted by Algerian diplomats,"" said David Farber, author of Taken Hostage: The Iranian Hostage Crisis and America's First Encounter with Radical Islam.
No Reagan administration officials participated in the negotiations, Farber said, and the Iranians waited to officially release the Americans as a final insult to Carter, whom they despised.
""They believed Carter had betrayed the Iranian revolution by allowing the self-exiled Shah to receive medical attention in the United States and then had threatened their new government by attempting, unsuccessfully, to use military force in April 1980 to free the hostages,"" Farber said.
Dave Houghton, a political scientist and author of U.S. Foreign Policy and the Iran Hostage Crisis, told PolitiFact that Iran had a relatively unsophisticated grasp of U.S. politics, and that it was possible that the Iranians ""didn’t even know what Reagan had said on the campaign trail.""
""I don't think they were scared into the release,"" Houghton said. ""In all likelihood, they released the hostages because they needed the sanctions we'd placed on them lifted so they could finance their war with Iraq.""
Rubio’s comments are a misreading of history, said Michael Gunter, professor of political science at Tennessee Technological University, who has authored several papers on the 1981 hostage release.
""It is clear that Sen. Marco Rubio is falling back on an exaggerated urban legend that the only way to deal with Iran is through implied threats of military retaliation, as President Reagan supposedly did,"" he said. ""Actually, successful U.S. diplomacy then and now played the most significant role.""
Our ruling
Rubio said that Iranian hostages were released in 1981 as Reagan took office because Iran perceived that America was ""no longer under the command of someone weak."" In reality, Reagan’s foreign policy approach wasn’t a factor in the hostages’ release, as scholars told us. The Carter administration negotiated the deal months before Reagan’s inauguration, without involvement by Reagan or his transition team. Rubio’s claim is an imaginative re-reading of history. We rate the statement Pants On Fire."

","The primary debate over race in this country seems to be whether the country needs to have a debate at all. Polls show white and black Americans have markedly different views of where the problems lie.
New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof has written a series of articles called "" When whites just don’t get it ."" Kristof applauded the progress in race equality America has achieved, but he basically argued that whites don’t know what life is like for blacks, and he presented many stats to show that great inequality remains.
Comedy Central’s The Daily Show aired video of Kristof making his case Dec. 4.
""The United States right now incarcerates more African-Americans as a percentage than apartheid South Africa did,"" Kristof said in the clip.
Numbers on the American side are easier to come by and are straightforward.
Kristof cited an Aspen Institute report that said, ""The United States imprisons a larger percentage of its black population than South Africa did at the height of apartheid.""
The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that, in 2010, the incarceration rate for black men in all of the country’s jails and prisons was 4,347 people per 100,000. For whites, the rate was 678 people per 100,000. America imprisons people far more in general than comparable countries. Among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations, the United States is the clear leader with an incarceration rate about two and half times higher than the second place country, Chile.
Precise numbers from South Africa during the apartheid years are more elusive.
As a refresher, apartheid was South Africa’s policy of strict segregation and differential treatment of people according to their race. It became fully part of South African law in 1950 with passage of the Population Registration Act. That law dovetailed with other bills to anchor race-based controls. For instance, the Lands Act set aside about 87 percent of property for whites, and the Group Areas Act forbid nonwhites from living in white-designated zones. The 1950 legislation involved a set of ""pass laws,"" so called because they created an internal passport system that supported the forced segregation.
The apartheid era lasted more than 40 years, ending in 1991 with the repeal of the apartheid laws.
William Worger, professor of history at the University of California-Los Angeles, is a longtime researcher of the apartheid era. Worger said the pass laws did much to fill the prisons.
""Most of the arrests and imprisonment in South Africa were for pass laws offences,"" Worger told PunditFact. ""The incarceration rate in South Africa in 1984 -- the midst of apartheid -- was 440 persons imprisoned per 100,000 population. Blacks comprised around 94 percent of those incarcerated.""
Based on Worger’s numbers, that would translate to an imprisonment rate of 612 per 100,000 for blacks in 1984.
A report from the advocacy group The Sentencing Project found an incarceration rate of 851 black South Africans per 100,000 in 1993 (two years after the end of apartheid). The figure tracks back to a 1993 report of the South African Correctional Services. The report combined the categories of ""black"" and ""colored"" to produce the black male rate of incarceration.
That’s two snapshots over a span of a decade, but it’s the best we have. In both cases, the numbers don’t begin to approach the current U.S. incarceration rate of African-American males.
Whatever the limits in these data, the relative numbers for South Africa and the United States hold up, simply based on the number of beds in the South African prison system. In 1992, according to a report by University of Cape Town researchers , the country housed about 109,000 inmates in space designed for about 88,000. While overcrowding was known to have been worse before 1992, the black imprisonment rate could not have come close to today’s American rate simply due to limited room.
There’s something of an international theme in countries comparing themselves to apartheid South Africa. We found Australian journalists drawing the same contrast relative to rates of imprisonment in their country.
Our ruling
Kristof said that America puts African-Americans behind bars at a higher rate than South Africa did under apartheid.
Based on the known evidence, that appears to be correct. In 2010, the black male incarceration rate in the United States was 4,347 people per 100,000 in the United States. That comes nowhere close to reported incarceration rates of blacks in South Africa during and immediately after the apartheid era.
We rate the claim True."

","Donald Trump reportedly told the Emperor of Japan that mass shootings can occur ""anywhere"", despite the country having some of the world's most stringent gun control policies.
The US President met Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko before a round of talks with Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, on Monday.
When the emperor brought up Sunday's mass killing at a church in Texas, Mr Trump called it a ""terrible incident"" and said the killings ""can happen anywhere"", according to the Mainichi Shimbun.

","(Permanent Musical Accompaniment To This Post)
Being our semi-regular weekly survey of what's goin' down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin' gets done, and where, in Paterson, that's just the way things go.
We have to start this week's tour in the newly insane state of North Carolina, where the dedication of the state legislature to getting past things seems isolated to the notion of ""getting past"" democracy. In November, the voters narrowly elected Roy Cooper, a Democrat, to replace Governor Pat McCrory, the man who put the ""lavatories"" in laboratories, much to the dismay of the local tourist economy.
Unfortunately, they left the Republican majorities in the state legislature intact, and those majorities are busy ensuring that Cooper will not have very much to do once he gets sworn in, and that he won't be able to do much of anything even if he tries. From The Charlotte Observer:
Lawmakers want to hobble the incoming Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, before he takes office Jan. 1 by making his Cabinet appointments subject to approval by the state Senate and cutting his ability to appoint members to UNC schools' boards of trustees and the state Board of Education. Another proposal in the mix would equally divide election boards between the two major political parties, ending control by the governor's party.
(This latter move likely would render the election boards as toothless as the FEC, and for the same reasons.)
Lewis, a Dunn Republican, said some of the appointment and election board changes were prompted by Cooper's election. ""Some of the stuff we're doing, obviously if the election results were different, we might not be moving quite as fast on, but a lot of this stuff would have been done anyway and has been talked about for quite some time,"" he said. On the proposed Senate role in confirming Cabinet members, Lewis said: ""We believe firmly that it's important for the legislature to be able to work with and communicate with the governor and the governor's cabinet selections."" He noted Senate confirmation hearings were held earlier in North Carolina's history. ""The framers of the constitution felt that Senate confirmation was important.""
At least they're being upfront about it.
And, because North Carolina employs the Second Worst Idea In American Politics—to wit: an elected judiciary—the legislature is determined to monkey around with the state Supreme Court, largely because the voters sent back a Democratic majority there, too. From the Star-Telegram:
A Senate bill would shift power from the N.C. Supreme Court that will be controlled by Democrats to the 15-member state Court of Appeals that will have a Republican majority. The Nov. 8 election shifted the political makeup of the state Supreme Court to a 4-3 Democratic majority, while Republicans won five seats on the appeals court that is one step below the Supreme Court. Lawmakers propose removing the right to make a constitutional challenge in a direct appeal to the state Supreme Court from Superior Court, a process approved by the Republican-led legislature while it had control of both legislative chambers, the governor's office and a 4-3 majority on the state's highest court. Under the bill introduced Wednesday, any such cases would have to be first heard by all 15 members of the Court of Appeals before the state's highest court could review the challenge. The bill also would add state Supreme Court justices to those positions in which party affiliation will be listed on the ballot. The legislature changed the law this summer so that Republicans were listed first on the state Court of Appeals ballots with their party affiliation included.
This is a brazen—and utterly shameless—attempt to jerry-rig the state's constitutional order so as to reverse the results of an election that didn't even go that badly for Republicans. They miss no tricks and they never, ever stop. Ni shagu nazad.
We swing over to Arkansas and discover via The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that something similarly Charlie-Brown-Meets-Football has been happening in that state's legislature as well.
The move means Democrats no longer have a majority on the House Revenue and Taxation Committee of the next General Assembly. When the committee meets during the regular session that starts Jan. 9, it will have 10 Republicans and 10 Democrats…""This is not a decision I made lightly,"" Jett said in his statement. ""I have given this a considerable amount of time, thought and prayer. I was encouraged to move forward after meeting with constituents throughout District 56."" Democrats, on the basis of seniority, had worked together to take control of the Revenue and Taxation Committee during a session last month. Jett has been chairman. Tax cuts are expected to be a source of contention in the upcoming session. Democrats had said that control of the House tax committee would allow them to influence decisions on whether the Legislature should cut taxes and, if so, which taxes to cut.
Well, as long as he prayed over it, I guess it's OK. ""Dear Lord: please give me your strength as I sell out. Be my shield and my buckler against those who would call me a noxious and inconstant poltroon. In Jesus' Name, I pray, unless I get a better offer…""
We move north to Michigan, where it seems the recount process of the most recent presidential election has evolved into something like a tickertape parade. From The Detroit News:
Michigan's largest county voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, but officials couldn't reconcile vote totals for 610 of 1,680 precincts during a countywide canvass of vote results late last month. Most of those are in heavily Democratic Detroit, where the number of ballots in precinct poll books did not match those of voting machine printout reports in 59 percent of precincts, 392 of 662…County reports obtained by The Detroit News, though, indicate canvassers were provided no explanation for why the numbers didn't add up in those precincts. They certified the results of the election anyway. In Detroit, 158 of the 392 precincts with ballot discrepancies had just one extra ballot accounted for either in the poll book or in the ballot box, according to the Wayne County's canvassing report. For suburban Wayne County, 72 percent of the 218 precincts boxes with discrepancies in the number of ballots were off by one ballot. The other ballot discrepancies in Detroit and Wayne County precincts ranged between two and five ballots, according to the report.
There are all sorts of dark suspicions about these apparent anomalies. But, at this point, the way we do elections in this country is so utterly fcked that it's probably a waste of effort to rig them.
Off we go west to Washington, which generally has been thought of as a kind of blue oasis, at least in its eastern (or non-Aryan Nation) half. But, emboldened by the election of El Caudillo del Mar-A-Lago, there are freak flags flying all over the state capitol these days, at least according to The Seattle Times.
Yet three Republican lawmakers have decided stadium safety would, in fact, be enhanced if the bare-chested guy next to you in face paint is also packing to defend you from ISIS.
Not to mention what it would do for Pete Carroll's piece of mind the next time he goes for a field goal on fourth-and-one with the spread on the line.
Finally, lawmakers offered up a perennial idea, but with some new urgency this year — that the way to really Make Washington Great Again is to break it in two. Under House Joint Memorial 4000, Eastern Washington would secede from the state. We here in Puget Sound are apparently harshing their freedom-loving buzz whenever they want to, say, kill some wolves, or log forests or work for sub-minimum wages. ""The Puget Sound rules from its iron throne or ivory tower, take your pick,"" said state Rep. Matt Shea, R-Spokane Valley, who is pushing secession. I like the ""Game of Thrones"" reference! I'm OK with secession; my only issue is the name they've dreamed up for this new state, which is ""Liberty."" Outside of Alaska, Eastern Washington is maybe the most subsidized, government-backed region in the nation, from the dam-irrigation system to the billions of tax dollars flowing into Hanford [from] King County propping up its schools, roads and hospitals.
I still have hope that, one day, we'll no longer be pestered by these hayseed Founding Father cosplayers, but I'm no longer sure I'll live to see it.
And we conclude, as is our custom, with the great state of Oklahoma, where Blog Official Reindeer Games Back Judge Friedman Of The Plains is on a well-deserved break, but where our crack research staff has discovered that Governor Mary Fallin and her pet legislature would like to harangue you more and more on the subject of fetus-fondling, and that they've gone out of their way to identify a captive audience. From Time:
…the state plans to require anti-abortion signs in restrooms in restaurants, public schools, hospitals and nursing homes.The signs, per AP, would read, in part: ""There are many public and private agencies willing and able to help you carry your child to term and assist you and your child after your child is born, whether you choose to keep your child or to place him or her for adoption. The State of Oklahoma strongly urges you to contact them if you are pregnant."" The signs are required to be posted in these institutions by January 2018. The provision was part of a law passed by the state legislature earlier this year that requires the state to produce informational material for pregnant women ""for the purpose of achieving an abortion-free society,"" according to AP. The state legislature did not allocate any funds for the signs, which are expected to cost more than $2 million. ""We don't have any concern about the information they're trying to get out to women about their babies and their pregnancy. This is just the wrong way to do it,"" Oklahoma Restaurant Association President Jim Hooper told the AP. ""It's just another mandate on small business.""
Yeah, Jim. It's the assault on the free market that makes this truly nuts.
This is your democracy, America. Cherish it.

","Kansas Tax Cut Experiment Comes To An End As Lawmakers Vote To Raise Taxes
Enlarge this image toggle caption John Hanna/AP John Hanna/AP
Kansas lawmakers have voted to roll back a series of major tax cuts that became an example for conservative lawmakers around the country but didn't deliver the growth and prosperity promised by Gov. Sam Brownback, a Republican.
A coalition of conservative Republicans, some of whom voted for sweeping tax cuts in 2012 or defended them in the years since, sided with moderates and Democrats to override Brownback's veto of a $1.2 billion tax increase.
The law to increase taxes over the next two years comes as legislators seek to close a projected $900 million budget gap for that same period and bolster funding for K-12 schools under a Kansas Supreme Court order.
""It's a huge vote,"" said state Rep. Steven Johnson, a Republican and chairman of the House tax panel, adding that legislative leadership had explored many routes to find a tax solution that would gain sufficient support in both chambers. ""It's a huge vote for looking for an option for Kansas among limited options.""
Floor debates on taxes ran late into Tuesday evening, but in the end, 27 senators and 88 representatives rendered Brownback's veto — which had been handed down just hours earlier — irrelevant.
Passage of the tax bill brings to an end signature tax policies of the Brownback administration. Most of those policies were part of a 2012 law that exempted owners of more than 300,000 small businesses and became a political flashpoint in recent elections.
With a tax plan complete and new school finance formula sent to the governor, the Legislature still must agree on the state budget.
It was the second time this session the governor sought to block legislation that would unravel 2012 tax changes and raise revenue through a three-bracket income tax structure. The first time, in February, lawmakers fell three votes short in the Senate of pushing past his opposition.
The veto nearly survived this time, too: Though the House exceeded the override threshold by four votes, the Senate results came in at exactly the minimum needed.
State Rep. Barbara Ballard, a Lawrence Democrat, described feeling tremendous relief, and said she believes many Kansans will share that sensation.
""Now we have a source of money. Then we can work our way out of the hole that we're in,"" she said. ""It's almost like you can breathe.""
Mopping it up
Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning said lawmakers had known since May 2014 that the tax cuts were leading to fiscal woes and not playing out as intended. He said while he voted for the 2012 changes, he believes in cleaning up one's messes in life and planned to cast his vote accordingly.
""I'm going to mop it up,"" he said.
Conservative Republican state Sen. Dennis Pyle drew on the nursery rhyme Humpty Dumpty in his appeal that colleagues uphold the veto. He suggested some lawmakers might think Brownback is like the main character in that poem, but it is in fact the spend-happy legislators who are shattered.
""They continue to want more and more,"" he said. ""They want to interfere in people's lives.""
The tax plan sets three income tax tiers: 3.1 percent, 5.25 percent and 5.7 percent. Kansas currently has two rates, 2.6 percent and 4.6 percent, for tax year 2018.
Much of the impassioned debate in the Senate came from conservative opponents of the bill, while many moderate Republicans and Democrats sat silent. Those who rose to comment rejected conservatives' claims that increasing taxes defies common sense.
""From our side of the aisle, that tax plan didn't receive a single vote,"" Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley said of the 2012 cuts, adding that Democrats had foreseen repercussions for the state's financial health.
State Sen. Tom Holland, a Democrat, said Kansas had been riding ""the crazy train"" and was long overdue for a solution."
progressive,"https://www.forbes.com/sites/instituteforjustice/2017/07/11/connecticut-just-banned-civil-forfeiture-without-a-criminal-conviction/#2afa121352e7
","Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy signed HB 7146 on Monday, which curbs the state’s civil forfeiture laws. Not only did the bill earn endorsements from the Yankee Institute for the Public Policy and the state chapter of the ACLU, HB 7146 even passed both the House and the Senate without a single no vote.
Under the new law, in order to permanently confiscate property with civil forfeiture, the property must be first seized in connection to either a lawful arrest or a lawful search that results in an arrest. If prosecutors do not secure a guilty verdict, a plea bargain or a dismissal from finishing a pretrial diversion program, the government must return the property to its rightful owner. With the stroke of a pen, Connecticut now becomes the 14th state to require a criminal conviction for most or all forfeiture cases.
“Civil forfeiture is one of the most serious assaults on Americans’ private property rights,” Institute for Justice Senior Legislative Counsel Lee McGrath said. “The bill is a solid first step to ensure that innocent people do not lose their property to this use of 17th Century admiralty law applied to the 21st Century war on drugs.”
According to data obtained by the Institute for Justice and the Reason Foundation, police and prosecutors generated more than $17.8 million in forfeiture revenue from 2009 to 2016. Nearly two-thirds of those proceeds came from civil forfeiture cases, where the owner did not have to be convicted. Law enforcement predominantly confiscated cash, but also seized dirt bikes, gold chains, and electronics like iPads, TVs and cell phones.
Although civil forfeiture is often defended as a way to stop large-scale drug cartels and criminal enterprises, in Connecticut, half of all civil forfeitures were under $570 in 2016. These small amounts suggest that many victims don’t have the means to fight back against a seizure in court. The state’s conviction requirement should protect many innocent Connecticutians.
But even with the new safeguard, there are several glaring defects in Connecticut’s forfeiture laws. For starters, the state still allows police and prosecutors to collect 69.5 percent of the proceeds from forfeited property. That provides a strong incentive to seek cases with a hefty payout.
Moreover, Connecticut agencies can spend forfeiture money without any public oversight or accounting, leaving both the public and lawmakers (who are supposed to control the power of the purse) completely in the dark. And unlike recent reforms in seven states, the bill does not address the federal equitable sharing program, which has long acted as a loophole to bypass state reforms.
To curb the temptation to police for profit, lawmakers should look to Maine, which sends forfeiture proceeds away from police coffers and towards the general fund. And to hold law enforcement accountable, Connecticut should copy recent reforms enacted in Arizona and Colorado, which force agencies to detail their forfeiture expenditures, including for salaries, overtime, travel, victim compensation, and drug treatment. Both states also mandate regular audits of forfeiture accounts and penalize noncompliant agencies.
Nevertheless, Connecticut’s new reform is an important step to curtail an constitutionally problematic practice. With the governor’s signature, Connecticut joins a growing, nationwide movement that has emerged in recent years to protect property rights from abusive seizures. Since 2014, the Constitution State is the 10th state to enact a conviction safeguard and the 24th state that tightened its forfeiture laws.
“No one should lose their property unless they are first convicted of a crime,” McGrath added. “Along with our bipartisan coalition partners at the ACLU of Connecticut and the Yankee Institute for Public Policy, we will keep fighting until civil forfeiture in Connecticut is abolished, once and for all.”"

American democracy is in sorry shape—battered on all sides by big money, restrictions on voting and vapid media that trivialize rather than enlighten. But Robert M. La Follette and the progressive reformers who a century ago established direct primaries, initiatives, and referendums; an elected US Senate; and voting rights for women always said that “the cure for what ails democracy is more democracy.”
In Ohio today, voters have an opportunity to apply the cure.
Ohio Issue 1, a proposed constitutional amendment to ban partisan gerrymandering and establish a bipartisan Ohio Redistricting Commission to draw legislative district lines, is being pitched as a good-government reform. But that undersells its significance. This is a bold response to America’s broken political processes.
The vote on Issue 1 is one of a number of vital tests that are in the ballot in states across the country today, as Americans go to the polls for a classic off-year election in which: Governors, legislators, mayors will be chosen today. Voters will also decide whether to legalize marijuana.
What makes Ohio’s Issue 1 test stand out is the fact that voters are being given a chance to address a key source of the political dysfunction that influences so many other issues.
Nothing does more to deny democracy than gerrymandering—the process by which legislators draw districts that are so heavily weighted toward one party that election results are preordained. When whole states are gerrymandered, the will of the voters can be and is thwarted—so that even if most voters cast their ballots for Democrats, Republicans might retain control of legislative chambers.
Gerrymandering is such a powerful tool for protecting incumbent politicians and parties—it is literally referred to as “representatives picking their voters rather than voters picking their representatives”—that in heavily gerrymandered states, many seats go uncontested in November elections. To the extent that there is competition, it is often in primaries, with a narrow minority of ideological absolutists threatening incumbent who works across party lines. Thus, gerrymandering has the duo effect of reducing partisan competition while increasing partisan gridlock.
This is why former Ohio state Senator Nina Turner, a leading voting rights advocate, says, “Redistricting reform is one of the most important issues we can tackle.”
That’s not just true for Ohio. It is true for Wisconsin, for North Carolina, and states across the country. With that understood, the Buckeye state does provide a powerful illustration of why gerrymandering must be addressed. THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. DONATE NOW!
In Ohio, a historically competitive state, Republicans swept to complete control of the governorship, lower-level statewide offices, and both houses of the state legislature in the Republican-wave election of 2010. They proceeded to draw district lines that were gerrymandered in their favor. Thus, even though Democratic President Barack Obama and Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown won big statewide victories in 2012, there was no parallel shift to the Democrats when it came to legislative races.
Why? Because, as former Ohio House minority leader Armond Budish, who served as the only Democrat on the current Ohio Apportionment Board noted during the 2011 redistricting process, the Republican majority on the board was able to force through a plan that effectively “quarantined” Democrats in roughly one-third of the Ohio’s legislative districts. The clear majority of districts were drawn to favor Republicans, while only a handful of state House and state Senate seats were considered to be genuinely competitive.
The fury at the extreme gerrymandering of the state—and the ensuing one-party governance by Governor John Kasich and his allies—has mounted over the years. And now, the response comes in the form of the amendment proposal, which would:
Establish a seven-person bipartisan commission with at least two members of the minority party.
Ban partisan gerrymandering with an “explicit prohibition against drawing districts primarily to favor or disfavor a political party.”
Require that districts reflect how voters actually voted: a plan could face a legal challenge if, for example, a party that wins about half of the votes for the General Assembly does not win about half of the seats.
Limit the use of maps lacking bipartisan support: If the commission approves a map without at least two votes from the minority party, the map will only be in effect for four years rather than 10. This creates an incentive for bipartisan cooperation because the majority party on the commission has no guarantee it will remain in the majority four years later.
This is not a perfect or final repair for the broken system in Ohio, let alone a perfect or final model for the rest of the country. For instance, the amendment addresses abuses only in the drawing of legislative district lines; it does not respond to the extreme gerrymandering of the state’s congressional districts. With that said, Issue 1 does aim in the right direction. And it has drawn broad, bipartisan support. Why? Because, as the Toledo Blade well notes, “Issue 1 is far preferable to the corrupt status quo. It enables Ohio voters to take back their state government from both parties.”
If Ohio voter ban partisan gerrymandering—and if the change is respected by the courts and implemented by the new commission—this has the potential to be an electoral game changer. “Redistricting reform is one of the most important issues we can tackle.”
As the Cincinnati Enquirer editorial endorsement of the measure correctly observed, “This election offers a rare chance to change politics as usual—and without casting a single vote for a candidate. Ohioans simply need to vote for Issue 1.”"

","Attorney General Jeff Sessions is clearly fired up to fight state marijuana laws. Unfortunately for him, Congress just doused his chances.
The new 1,665-page spending bill maintains a provision that prevents the Department of Justice from using any of its funds to hamper state laws related to medical marijuana. The department cannot “prevent any of them from implementing their own laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana,” Section 537 of the bill reads.
The $1.1 trillion spending bill—the Consolidated Appropriations Act, H.R. 244 (PDF)—passed the Senate today with a 79-to-18 vote. The White House has signaled that Trump will sign it, which will keep the government running until September.
The section that ties the hands of the Department of Justice on medical marijuana enforcement is not new. It has been around since 2015. But it received little fanfare amid the Obama Administration, which took a lenient stance on enforcing federal marijuana laws in states that legalized use.

All that changed when Jeff Sessions took control of the Department of Justice. Sessions has repeatedly said he opposes legalization and signaled that he would abandon Obama’s lax enforcement position.
For instance, in an April 2016 Congressional Hearing, Sessions proclaimed that “good people don’t smoke marijuana.” When Sessions was asked about enforcement this February at a press conference, he said:
I am definitely not a fan of expanded use of marijuana. But states, they can pass the laws they choose. I would just say, it does remain a violation of federal law to distribute marijuana throughout any place in the United States, whether a state legalizes it or not.
With Section 537, Sessions can still go after recreational use of marijuana in the eight states that have passed such laws. But without funding, Sessions has little ability to fight the medical marijuana laws in 29 states and the District of Columbia.
In a press release, Robert Capecchi, director of federal policies for the Marijuana Policy Project, supported the inclusion of Section 537 in the bill. He also pushed for permanent laws to protect state marijuana policies."

progressive,"https://www.newsweek.com/elizabeth-warren-trump-saudi-arabia-lobbyists-1249420
","Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to 18 Washington, D.C., lobbying companies on Wednesday, calling on them to reveal their ties to Saudi Arabia. The letter also called for information on whether the Trump administration was involved in any of the Saudi projects.
""This ongoing status as a representative of Saudi government interests raises questions about whether your firm prioritizes profit margins over basic human rights, and whether it is ethically and morally defensible for American lobbyists to be providing services to a repressive foreign regime that does not share America's values,"" Warren wrote to the 18 companies.
The letter from Warren was directed to Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, MSLGroup Americas, Hohlt Group Global LLC, Hogan Lovells U.S. LLP, Fleishman-Hillard, Hill and Knowlton Strategies, Just Consulting LLC, Portland PR, Southfive Strategies LLC, SAPRAC Inc., Capitol Media Group, Churchill Ripley LLC, McKeon Group, Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, Squire Patton Boggs LLP, November Team LLC, CGCN Group and King & Spalding.
Saudi Arabia spent around $27 million on lobbying in 2017, according to some estimates. Department of Justice filings revealed that the Saudi government has spent almost $7 million on foreign agents this year.
Washington lobbyists and lawmakers have come under increased scrutiny since Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2. Khashoggi was a U.S. resident and a columnist for The Washington Post who was highly critical of the Saudi regime.
CIA Director Gina Haspel has privately briefed members of Congress on the killing, and several congressmen immediately concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for directing the killing. Senator Bob Corker, a Republican and the head of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, said that the crown prince would be convicted of murder in 30 minutes if he were made to stand trial.
With this in mind, some lawmakers have been calling for the U.S. to halt its arms sales to Saudi Arabia and withdraw U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.
On Wednesday, senators including Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio and Dianne Feinstein introduced a nonbinding resolution saying that Salman is responsible for Khashoggi's killing as well as the ongoing humanitarian disaster in Yemen. It calls on Trump to hold the crown prince responsible.
Last week, senators voted 63-37 to move forward a resolution that would end U.S. military support for the war in Yemen. At least five of the Republican senators who voted against the resolution had received funding from lobbyists working for Saudi Arabia.
Senators will vote on the resolution again sometime in the coming weeks.
Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez and Republican Senator Todd Young introduced another bill last month that would suspend weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and place sanctions on individuals believed to be linked to Khashoggi's death. That bill has not yet left committee, however.
Throughout all this, Trump has been almost alone in insisting that the relationship with Saudi Arabia is too important to lose. In an effort to understand why Trump is unwilling to hold the crown prince accountable for the brutal killing of a journalist, many are calling on both Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to reveal whether they have personal financial ties to Saudi Arabia.
Warren, meanwhile, wrote an additional letter to the five lobbying companies that have reportedly canceled their contracts with Saudi Arabia in the wake of the Khashoggi killing. They are BGR, the Glover Park Group, the Harbour Group, the Gladstone Place Partners LLC and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP.
""If the reports are accurate, the decision to terminate lobbying services for the Saudi government is a positive step toward reducing the corrosive influence of foreign governments and other special interests on our democracy,"" Warren wrote to the companies.
Warren is widely believed to be planning to run as the Democratic nominee for president in 2020 and has already started speaking publicly about U.S. foreign policy.
""It's clear that the Pentagon is captured by the so-called 'Big Five' defense contractors—and taxpayers are picking up the bill,"" Warren said on November 29 during her first major foreign policy speech.
""If you're skeptical that this a problem, consider this: The president of the United States has refused to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia in part because he is more interested in appeasing U.S. defense contractors than holding the Saudis accountable for the killing of a Washington Post journalist or for the thousands of Yemeni civilians killed by those weapons,"" she said."
progressive,"https://www.newsweek.com/blasey-ford-lying-skank-says-fox-news-contributor-kevin-jackson-who-1143140
","Fox News cut ties with a network contributor on Thursday after he referred to the women who have accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault as ""lying skanks.""
In a series of tweets, radio host Kevin Jackson lashed out against allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford, 51, Deborah Ramirez, 53, and Julie Swetnick, 55.
He was reacting in real-time to the emotional testimony of Ford, who appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
""#ChristineBlaseyFord academic problems came from her PROMISCUITY!"" he wrote on Twitter during the Senate appearance. ""Dang girl stop opening your legs and OPEN A BOOK!""
He also wrote: ""Feminists are their own worst enemies, and enemy of women. Also, they want men to NEVER be believed. I'm not succumbing. TO HELL with the notion that women must be believed no matter what. Lying skanks is what these 3 women are, and we ALL know more.""
In a brief statement on Thursday, Fox confirmed it would no longer work with the host. ""Kevin Jackson has been terminated as a contributor,"" a spokesperson said. ""His comments on today's hearings were reprehensible and do not reflect the values of Fox News.""
Ford, who is a psychology professor in California, has alleged that she was assaulted at a house party by Brett Kavanaugh when she was 15-years-old. Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his penis to her at a dorm party as a freshman. Swetnick accused Kavanaugh of getting girls drunk so they could be ""gang-raped"" but did not say Kavanaugh himself had attacked her.
Kavanaugh—who also provided testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday— denied the allegations. But he sidestepped suggestions that the FBI should investigate.
At times he waded into left-wing conspiracy theory territory.
""I'm not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time,"" he told senators. ""But I have never done this. To her or to anyone. That's not who I am. It is not who I was. I am innocent of this charge.""
Kavanaugh referred to his own calendars as evidence of his innocence. His mood repeatedly swung from tearful to angry.
Many Republican senators had declined to question Ford directly on Thursday, instead hiring a veteran sex crimes prosecutor from Arizona, Rachel Mitchell, to question Ford. But the outside counsel was mysteriously abandoned when the time came to question Kavanaugh, and grandstanding ensued."

progressive,"https://theweek.com/articles/902018/conservative-movement-public-health-hazard
","It is by now beyond any question that President Trump has bungled the response to the novel coronavirus pandemic about as badly as one could possibly imagine. Senegal, a country with a per-capita GDP of about $3,500, is conducting mass tests for the virus and getting results within 4 hours, while the tiny handful of Americans who can even access tests have to wait days or even weeks. On Friday, a single Chinese oligarch announced he was donating to America on the order of 30 times more test kits than there had been tests conducted across the entire United States since the start of the outbreak up to that point.
It has been clear since 1980 that under Republican rule, the federal government decays. But under Trump, it has gotten full-blown administrative gangrene. Compared to what is needed to combat the crisis, Trump has done basically nothing. Meanwhile, he and his allies in conservative media have pushed an avalanche of misinformation that will only accelerate the spread of the disease. This is what the conservative movement has become: a gigantic public health hazard for America and the world.
There are two main ways in which conservatives have dissolved the bones of American government. The first is ideological. For decades, Republicans have been pushing a libertarian economic vision that can be summarized as ""Government Bad."" By this view, the government is a largely-pointless hindrance to private enterprise, and basically all regulations and social welfare programs should be done away with. (Prisons and the military can stay, of course.)
But there are many, many things, like public health emergencies, in which private businesses simply cannot handle things on their own. Nothing but the federal government can carry out the rapid and extensive actions needed to coordinate a response to a galloping nationwide viral pandemic, and the federal government is by far best able to finance one. As The New Republic's Alex Pareene writes, the right-wing extremists in the Trump administration have reacted with a sort of slack-jawed disbelief at the private sector completely failing to rise to the coronavirus challenge.
Second and more importantly, there is the conservative propaganda machine. The American right-wing media is without question the most unhinged, hysterical, irresponsible, and conspiracy-addled major press complex in the world. The right-wing media in the U.K. and Australia come close (probably because of shared language and ownership), but nobody beats Fox News in their combination of wide reach and utterly shameless propaganda.
On the one hand, Fox News, The Federalist, Rush Limbaugh, and so on are akin to the state media in a communist dictatorship. The movement is never wrong, Republican politicians are always right, and their political enemies are loathsome traitors who hate freedom, puppies, and apple pie. News that reflects badly on Trump is either made up or the product of a dastardly foreign or left-wing conspiracy. Aging white people across the country have turned their brains to pudding watching Sean Hannity yell insane racist nonsense at them night after night.
But on the other, a dominant faction of Republican politicians, including President Trump, are themselves melt-brained propaganda addicts. This is not how dictatorships usually work. In communist China, the top political leadership sets the party line coming out of the agitprop press, rather than the other way around. Leaders are influenced by party ideology, of course, but they still have wide latitude to change course — like when the initial line that the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan was in hand turned out to be drastically mistaken, the Chinese Communist Party turned on a dime and started mass quarantines and lockdowns.
Trump, by contrast, has been loyally watching and live-tweeting Fox News while the epidemic spreads like wildfire, and doing almost nothing to stop it. The line coming from that network and the rest of conservative media is largely that the coronavirus is either fake, a foreign bioweapon, or a Democratic Party/mainstream media conspiracy to undermine the GOP. Rush Limbaugh said the virus was just the ""common cold"" that was being ""weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump."" Hannity suggested it might be entirely a fraud. (To be fair, Tucker Carlson and Michael Savage have tried to raise the alarm, but they are outliers.)
In another alarming public address Friday, Trump insisted he and his cronies were doing an ""incredible job,"" despite the ongoing failure to test remotely adequately or pass anything to deal with the developing economic crisis. (He did however boast that America has many large companies.)
The remarkable thing about the denial-and-downplay strategy is that conservative Americans, being disproportionately elderly, are also disproportionately at risk from novel coronavirus. Limbaugh himself is 69 years old and has lung cancer. It could be that, given how utterly incompetent Trump is, furious spinning is the only strategy available.
But there is another important part of the story: conservative media is run by horrible monsters who constantly grift their own viewers and listeners. Whipping up foaming hysteria about liberals is a great opportunity to trick elderly retirees out of a piece of their retirement savings, it turns out. Even as the coronavirus scythe blade descends towards thousands of nursing and retirement homes where Fox News is on every minute of the day, these disgusting scum are using it to hawk garbage investment guides and quack snake oil cures.
First, the conservative movement dissolved the brains of its membership, then those people ended up in charge and dissolved the American government. Now that destruction is going to create quite possibly the worst outbreak of coronavirus in the entire world. Perhaps if the conservative movement suffers thousands of casualties among its own ranks it will finally try some introspection. But I would bet they'll just blame Barack Obama instead.

progressive,"http://www.rawstory.com/2016/01/if-the-oregon-militiamen-were-muslim-or-black-theyd-be-dead-by-now/
","If, in a vacuum, I told you that a bearded man with his head covered had posted a video on social media calling on his followers to leave their homes with weapons, migrate to a new area, take over government property “as long as necessary” and use violence if confronted by law enforcement, you’d probably assume that I was talking about the latest propaganda video released by Isis, filmed in Iraq or Syria and intended to recruit violent Muslim extremists.
But that exact call was recently issued on Facebook by white rancher Ammon Bundy, the son of Cliven Bundy who also engaged in an armed standoff with law enforcement in 2014 and who currently owes the government more than $1m in fees. The younger Bundy’s goal this time was to encourage his fellow American “patriots” to take up arms against the US government in protest of the arson convictions of ranchers Dwight Hammond Jr and his son, Steven.
Militia leaders claim approximately 150 followers accepted Ammon Bundy’s call, although reporters on the ground are saying it’s far fewer. The armed men are currently occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Burns, Oregon to, in their words, “assist in helping the people of Harney County claim back their lands and resources” . Ammon Bundy has said that his people won’t “rule out violence” if law enforcement “tries to remove them”.
But, don’t worry America: he promised everyone that “we are not terrorists”. What a relief.
Of course they’re not “terrorists”: Bundy and his followers are just your average angry white “freedom fighters”, who use weapons and ammunition to protect the US constitution and American values from the government and other Americans who want them to abide by federal laws like everyone else.
But if Bundy and his followers were like the 38% of Americans who aren’t white , people across America wouldn’t be watching this surreal, dangerous episode unfold and wondering what they could do to be labeled a “militia” when occupying a federal area with guns instead of “terrorists”, “thugs”, “extremists” or “gangs”.
If one black man holding a plastic toy gun even walked in the direction of a federal building, let alone with 150 other black men all holding loaded rifles, he’d be shot dead by law enforcement, no questions asked. If 15 Muslims occupied a 7-Eleven with BB guns and masala Slurpees, federal law enforcement would probably roll up with 6 MRAPs and immediately take everyone out Waco-style (but without a Congressional investigation ).
We don’t need to racially profile individuals who look like these armed militiamen (white men with bushy beards and beer bellies), but it’s time for mainstream politicians to at least acknowledge and confront this dangerous threat within our borders.
Since 9/11, more people in America have been killed by right wing terror attacks than violent jihadists (48 deaths to 45 deaths) . America witnessed an “unprecedented rise” in radical right wing, anti-government groups after the election of President Barack Hussein Obama. Yet, the Department of Homeland Security buried an analyst’s early 2009 warning about the growing threat of right wing terror groups to focus solely on Muslim extremists, caving to conservative pundits who complained the DHS was demonizing right wing speech by targeting these groups.
And although the number of people involved has reduced in the past two years, it has not dampened the level of criminal extremism, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Such groups , some of whom have been involved in armed hostilities since the report was withdrawn, are also often openly white supremacist, hostile to immigrants, Islamophobic and prone to anti-government conspiracies.
In other words, they are not unlike Donald Trump’s base . And while this is the time that we would normally expect calls for all moderate militiamen to stand up and condemn the violent extremism within their midst, don’t hold your breath. Republican Senator and presidential candidate Ted Cruz will probably not ignore political correctness and ask, “How can we defeat radical white terrorism with Presidential candidates who refuse to utter the words ‘radical white terrorists?’” Trump, who recently said that he’s in favor of killing the family of terrorists to defeat extremists, will assuredly not apply the same standard to white American “militia” members, even if they do employ the violence they’ve promised.
The sad truth is that extremists – both at home and abroad – are often disaffected, frightened and angry people desperately searching for purpose, validation and meaning in a world they feel has left them behind. It’s a sickness that can infect almost anyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or gender.
It’s certainly taken hold of Jon Ritzheimer, a US Marine veteran involved in the Oregon stand-off . He’s a member of the Three Percenter club , which alleges that their armed and trained members are “defenders of the constitution” willing to “protect our rights against a tyrannical government and foreign invaders”. (Like Bundy, they do not condone any threats or intimidation tactics “unless an action is warranted”.) Ritzheimer also led the armed, anti Muslim mosque protests earlier this year in Arizona .
Before taking over the wildlife refuge, Ritzheimer – like other extremists before him – posted a “goodbye” video for his family rationalizing his actions as defending freedom against a “tyrannical government.” “I didn’t come here to shoot, I came here to die,” echoed another militia member , who identified himself only as “Captain Moroni”.
Extremism comes in different colors, ethnicities, beards and head coverings – which is why racial profiling cannot protect us from all extremist violence. Maybe it’s time for politicians and law enforcement to acknowledge inconvenient truths and confront the extremists with “American” names and grievances as they would any other. The security of our homeland – or at least our national wildlife refuges – might depend on it.

","It gets stranger. These two groups—the brave students demanding to prevent another tragedy, and those denying their very existence from behind computer screens—have something profound in common.
They’re both responding to the dominant condition of our nation today: mistrust.
In the mid-1960s, 77 percent of Americans reported trust in the U.S. government to do the right thing all or most of the time, according to surveys from Gallup and the National Elections Survey. Asked the same question in a Gallup poll late last year, only 18 percent reported trusting the government. This isn’t a Trump-specific phenomenon. Trust has been falling in the United States for decades, and it hit comparably low points during the Clinton and Obama presidencies.
It’s also not a government-specific phenomenon. Trust in virtually all American institutions is down sharply since the 1960s and 1970s, including people’s faith in banks, churches, healthcare, and big business. Our loss of trust in government, in media, and in each other helps explain this peculiar moment, a time when some of us can’t believe the government’s inability to take action and others can’t believe what they’re seeing.
The students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas are discovering that they can’t trust their elected officials to take action on gun control. And why should they? The Columbine massacre occurred in 1999, before any of these children were born. Legislators have had 18 years to ensure that American schools are safe places for students to learn. Instead, students are so familiar with drills to protect themselves from mass shootings that one enterprising high schooler, Justin Rivard, has designed a metal brace that can secure a classroom door from an active shooter who blasts off a lock. Tragically, Rivard’s clever hack has a much better chance of being adopted than legislation to institute universal background checks, which 97 percent of Americans support.
Despite having good reason not to trust the political process, the students are doing what we’ve been taught to do as citizens: tell our legislators what we think, and if they don’t listen, demand to be heard. So far, that’s not gone especially well. One group of students traveled to Tallahassee to meet with legislators and instead watched 71 Republican legislators block debate on bills to limit high-capacity magazines. A town meeting with legislators, televised by CNN, went little better, as politicians squirmed uncomfortably and failed to answer the blunt questions put forward by students.
Watching the Marjory Stoneman Douglas students engage with their elected leaders is a crash course in understanding how people develop mistrust in representative democracies. The fear is that the experience will quickly teach the students that change is impossible. The hope, instead, is that they will learn that change can occur, but perhaps not through the methods they’ve been taught to use. While the Florida legislature prioritizes debating the health risks of pornography over considering gun control, online campaigns have convinced airlines, rental-car companies, and banks to cut their ties with the NRA. The uncomfortable lesson may be that corporations are more responsive to customer concerns than lawmakers are to their constituents. This may be good news in the short term for activists, but it should be a bright red flag for anyone concerned for democracy in the long term."

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Republican nominee for Georgia’s 14th congressional district, is a harbinger of her party’s post-Trump future. She’s running in a strongly Republican district with an almost certain prospect of going to Congress. She disdains Black Lives Matter and argues that Muslims shouldn’t be allowed to serve in government. She’s also an adherent of QAnon, the amorphous conspiracy theory that holds that Donald Trump is battling a secret cabal of Satanic cannibalistic pedophiles who control the Democratic Party, Hollywood, and the American government.
In a 2017 video, Greene said, “There’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles out, and I think we have the president to do it.” For his part, Trump returned Greene’s regard. On August 12, the president tweeted, “Congratulations to future Republican Star Marjorie Taylor Greene on a big Congressional primary win in Georgia against a very tough and smart opponent. Marjorie is strong on everything and never gives up—a real WINNER.” Asked about QAnon on Friday, Trump avoided disavowing the conspiracy theory and reiterated his praise of Greene.
This tweet is in keeping with Trump’s general approach of aligning himself with the QAnon movement but not explicitly affirming it. As The New York Times notes, “Trump has not directly addressed QAnon, but he has conspicuously avoided denouncing it, and has shared dozens of posts from believers on his social media accounts.”
A few Republicans, to their credit, have spoken out against Greene and QAnon—but they all are much less well-known than Trump. On the same day as Trump’s warm words for Greene, Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois tweeted, “Qanon is a fabrication,” adding that there is “no place in Congress for these conspiracies.” Another Republican, Virginia Representative Denver Riggleman, tweeted, “QAnon is the mental gonorrhea of conspiracy theories. It’s disgusting and you want to get rid of it as fast as possible.” MORE FROM Jeet Heer Don’t Stop Thinking About (Tom) Tomorrow March 5, 2021 Democrats Need to Hold Andrew Cuomo Accountable March 3, 2021 Trump Does a Victory Dance at CPAC March 1, 2021 Author page
But if QAnon is gonorrhea, more and more Republicans are getting infected, and party leaders are doing nothing to stop the spread. Kinzinger and Riggleman are lonely voices in their own party. As CNN reports, “Top Republicans, including President Donald Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, are embracing their party’s nominee for a House seat in Georgia, despite her history of racist and anti-Semitic remarks and promotion of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory.” Other Georgia Republicans, notably Senator Kelly Loeffler and Representative Doug Collins, have joined in welcoming Greene’s primary victory.
The response of the GOP to Greene echoes the way the party handled Trump in 2016. At first there was some trepidation about Trump, with a few voices denouncing what he was doing to the party. But eventually, Republicans made their peace with Trump when they realized that they had to support him as their standard-bearer or suffer humiliating defeat as a divided party.
“The future of the Republican Party very well may be Marjorie Taylor Greene,” argues Dan Pfeiffer, former Obama adviser. “Greene is one of eleven QAnon supporting Republican congressional nominees on the ballot this fall.” Current Issue View our current issue
The conservative writer Bill Kristol, although a critic of the Republican Party under Trump, disagrees with this assessment. According to The New York Times, Kristol is “skeptical about QAnon’s influence on the Republican Party. He pointed out that there had always been extreme outliers in both parties of Congress whose influence tended to be diluted by more moderate voices over time.”
But even Kristol acknowledged that Trump’s embrace could give QAnon a greater reach. “If Trump is the president, and he’s embracing this, are we so confident that it’s not the future?” Kristol wondered.
QAnon is a byproduct of the Trump era and is likely to be part of his lasting legacy, long outliving his presidency. QAnon is best understood as a myth that helps Trump supporters reconcile themselves to his manifest flaws as a man and political leader. Trump thrives on negative partisanship, which requires that he be seen as preferable to his rivals. Given numerous reports of his sexual predations and corruption, the only way he can be acceptable is if his foes have committed the worst crimes imaginable. The embryonic version of QAnon was Pizzagate, which painted Hillary Clinton as a leader of a child sex ring.
The current version of QAnon took off on social media in 2017 when Trump was enmeshed in the Russiagate investigation. The conspiracy theory emerged on 4chan, a message board that facilitates anonymous posting. “Q” claimed to be a high-level insider with “Q” security clearance who had information that the entire Mueller investigation was a false flag operation used by Trump to hide his war against powerful pedophiles. Again, it served a narrative function: Building on the Pizzagate story line, it portrayed Trump as a heroic battler against a “deep state” conspiracy, thus helping to wave away evidence of actual corruption. It’s no accident that prominent Russiagate figures like former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Trump crony Roger Stone have embraced QAnon.
The current upsurge of QAnon is a response to the Covid-19 pandemic. As NBC news reports, “While QAnon bubbled on the fringes of the internet for years, researchers and experts say it has emerged in recent months as a sort of centralized hub for conspiracy and alternative health communities. According to an internal document reported by NBC News this week, Facebook now has more than 1,000 of these QAnon groups, totaling millions of members.”
The report goes on to note that social media users “who started off in wellness communities, religious groups and new-age groups on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram during the pandemic were then introduced to extremist groups like QAnon, aided by shared beliefs about energy, healing or God—and often by recommendation algorithms.”
QAnon has been resilient because it’s a myth that serves to explain Trump’s failures and wretched personal behavior. QAnon has helped recast a sexual predator as a covert fighter against pedophilia and an incompetent response to Covid-19 as a heroic battle against a pro-mask conspiracy.
If we understand QAnon as a conciliatory myth that evolves to excuse the horrific truth about Trump and Trumpism, then it is likely to have a long life after he is defeated. It’ll become a Lost Cause myth about how a great man was felled by a sinister conspiracy. Donald Trump Jr. has already shared an Instagram post suggesting that Joe Biden is a pedophile. The president’s son explained the post by saying he was only “joking around.”
QAnon is not a nonviolent movement. As Media Matters reports:
The QAnon conspiracy theory has been tied to multiple violent incidents and threats of violence, including a man accused of murdering his brother with a sword, a man accused of murdering an alleged crime boss, a man who reportedly threatened to kill YouTube employees, an armed man who blocked the Hoover Dam with an armored vehicle, and even a man who threatened to assassinate Trump, among numerous other incidents.
If Trump loses and QAnon evolves into a narrative about how a conspiracy of pedophiles won, then it’ll become even more violent than it already is.
QAnon is sometimes treated as if it were analogous to the Tea Party movement or the John Birch Society, a right-wing faction within the GOP coalition. But in fact it is much more violence-prone than those groups. It’s closer in spirit to terrorist organizations like the KKK, which had ties to political elites but also instigated extrajudicial violence.
Trump could leave the White House in January of next year, but QAnon will be with us for a long time to come."

","President Donald Trump has argued that many voters who support him did not vote in the midterm elections because his name was not on the ballot. | AP Photo/Susan Walsh White House Warning signs mount for Trump reelection bid ‘They haven’t gotten his job approval over 50 percent, like Reagan,’ says one GOP pollster.
Donald Trump insists the GOP’s midterm election shellacking had nothing to do with him. Things will be different, he says, when his name is actually on the ballot in 2020.
While it’s true that most presidents who see their party suffer major losses in their first midterm election get reelected anyway, Trump isn’t most presidents — and there are lots of blaring-red warning lights in this month’s election results for his bid for a second term.
Unlike most of his predecessors, he’s been persistently unpopular, with approval ratings mired in the 40-percent range — so far, he’s the only president in the modern era whose job approval ratings have never been over 50 percent, according to Gallup.
Some of Democrats’ biggest gains came in the states that powered Trump’s Electoral College victory in 2016: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And while a president’s base has stayed home in previous midterm elections, leading to losses, the record turnout in this year’s races suggests 2018 was more like a 2016 re-run than Trump voters standing on the sidelines.
Thus far, even Trump loyalists in the party haven’t seen the president expand his electoral base beyond core Republicans.

“This is now the party of Donald Trump. I read articles saying the Republican Party has merged with the Trump coalition — they have no choice. Trump voters own the Republican Party. That’s consolidated,” said John McLaughlin, who was part of the team of pollsters working on Trump’s 2016 campaign. “The bad part is they haven’t broadened [his coalition]. They haven’t gotten his job approval over 50 percent, like Reagan. We haven’t done that.”
Republicans have taken solace in the examples of recent presidents who saw their party drubbed in their first midterm, only to win a resounding reelection victory two years later.
Barack Obama’s Democratic Party lost 63 House seats and 6 Senate seats in 2010, but Obama defeated former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in 2012. Republicans flipped both the House, where they netted 52 seats, and Senate in 1994, but Bill Clinton slaughtered former Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) in 1996. Ronald Reagan’s GOP lost 26 House seats in 1982 — and picked up a seat in the Senate — but Reagan nearly swept the Electoral College against former Vice President Walter Mondale two years later, winning a 49-state landslide.
Reagan’s example has been a balm for some Republicans, especially given the similarities in the House-Senate split decisions — Republicans gained at least one Senate seat this year, pending the results of next week’s special-election runoff in Mississippi. But in order to repeat his feat, Trump’s approval rating would have to rise to heretofore-unseen levels: Reagan was in the low-40s around the 1982 midterms and improved to 58 percent in the Gallup poll immediately before the 1984 election.
Throughout the campaign, even the most optimistic Republican pollsters were modeling a turnout rate far higher than in previous midterm elections. And that’s borne out in the election results: As of Thursday, more than 111.7 million votes had been counted in House elections nationwide, according to the Cook Political Report.
Estimates are that the final count will be around 113 million — a lot closer to the 129.8 million votes that were cast in House races in the presidential year of 2016 than 2014’s paltry turnout of 79 million votes.
Republicans made gains in 2010 because — in large part — the coalition that elected then-President Barack Obama didn’t come out to vote in his midterms. Turnout dropped from 120.7 million in 2008, to 86.9 million in 2010.
“All the data indicated that voters were really pumped [this year] — that there was an excitement and energy that we didn’t really see in 2010 and 2012,” said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster who worked for Romney’s 2012 presidential bid. “What you see in this election is not only can Democrats turn their votes out, but Trump demonstrated an extraordinary ability to turn his votes out, too.”
Trump has argued, however, that many voters who support him stayed home on Election Day.
“I didn't run. I wasn't running. My name wasn't on the ballot,” Trump told “Fox News Sunday,” in an interview recorded last week. “There are many people that think, ‘I don't like Congress,’ that like me a lot. I get it all the time: ‘Sir, I will never vote unless you were on the ballot.’ I get it all the time.
“People are saying, ‘Sir, I will never vote unless you're on the ballot. I say, ‘No, no, go and vote,’” he added. “As much as I try and convince people to go vote, I'm not on the ballot.”
There were some bright spots in the wreckage for Republicans who, besides expanding their slim Senate majority also held Florida’s governorship and ousted Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson by the narrowest of margins. They retained the governorship in Ohio, though Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown won reelection. Iowa GOP Gov. Kim Reynolds also won a full term, but Democrats beat two of the state’s three Republican members of Congress.
But the biggest advances for Democrats were made in the three states that put Trump over the top in the Electoral College in 2016: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Democrats won the governorships in all three — wresting away an open seat in Michigan and defeating two-term incumbent Scott Walker in Wisconsin, while holding Pennsylvania. Democratic incumbent senators in all three won reelection without breaking much of a sweat.
Democrats also won six more House elections across Michigan and Pennsylvania than they had captured in 2016, helped in large part by a new congressional map in Pennsylvania.
“There’s simply no evidence that those states are crying out for more Trump,” said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who worked for then-Sen. John Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign.
The map could expand beyond those three states, too. Mellman added that the Florida results were “essentially a tie,” and Sen.-elect Kyrsten Sinema’s victory in Arizona — she’s the first Democrat to win a Senate race there since 1988 — is a sign that the state “is likely to be a significant battleground” in 2020.
Pollsters from both parties say Trump’s chances of recovering depend, in part, on improving his approval rating, which he’s thus far failed to do. In the latest POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, 45 percent of registered voters approved of the job Trump is doing as president — equal to his performance in two separate exit polls of 2018 voters, and consistent with the past year, when his approval rating has ranged between 40 and 47 percent.
“Trump’s approval rating has been historically very low,” said Mellman. “Other presidents have been as well, but their approval ratings have been more malleable. His is sort of stuck.”
Lynn Vavreck, a professor at the University of California-Los Angeles and a member of the advisory board for the American National Election Studies, said she’s skeptical public opinion of Trump will change markedly in the next two years.
“It’s so divided by partisanship,” said Vavreck. “Republicans approve of him, and Democrats don’t. And that’s pretty much the floor and the ceiling. There’s not a lot of room for movement, unless Republicans turn on him, or Democrats learn to like him. I don’t see either of things happening.”
But pollsters and experts also urge caution against assuming the die is cast against Trump. Presidents typically see their party lose seats in their first midterms, and most presidents get reelected.
“It [usually] borders on the foolish to draw a straight line from the midterms to the next general,” Mellman said.
In 2020, not only can the president run against the new House Democratic majority — he’ll have an opponent with whom to contrast himself.
“Be careful of extrapolating 2018 success into what it means for 2020 because it just doesn’t fit,” Newhouse said. “2018 was more of a referendum on President Trump. 2020 is going to be more of a choice. And Trump does much better in a choice battle when he has someone to run against.”"
progressive,"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/12/trump-s-election-stunt-border-cost-us-taxpayers-210-million
","Trump’s deployment of more than 5,000 American troops to the southern border – a mission that cannot in good conscience be called quixotic only because at least Don Quixote actually believed the windmills at which he was tilting were real monsters – will cost American taxpayers at least $72 million, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.
The real number is higher still, because it includes Trump’s activation earlier in the year of the National Guard to the border, which cost a further $138 million. That means that it is now possible to put a price-tag on one of the most bare-faced and cynical election stunts in American history: $210 million.
Trump only talked about the so-called “migrant caravan” – which he framed as an invading army, playing to the fears of White Nationalists by describing them almost lasciviously as “young strong men” many of whom could be “Middle Eastern” – in order to activate his base in border states such as Texas.
The so-called caravan is an annual event, and is actually a group of asylum-seekers from parts of Central America whose lives are threatened and who are traveling together for reasons of safety. The ultimate irony, of course, is that the violence from which many of them are fleeing is the result of decades of American foreign policy, especially the drug war, which has turned much of the region over to the control of powerful drug cartels.
Any sense that Trump really believed that the caravan posed a real threat has been entirely stamped out by the fact that, now that the election is over and it has served its purpose as a bogeyman, he has almost stopped mentioning it except when pressed by the media. Certainly he would not admit the key point, which is that the caravan happens each year, and they intend to apply for asylum at the US border – a totally legal process – rather than try to enter illegally.
Sure, presidents have used military action for electioneering purposes before. It is one of the tenets of democracy that military deployments in the short term shore up polling and allow a leader previously perceived as weak to be perceived as strong.
No, of course it was just for election purposes, which meant that his deployment of US soldiers to the border at huge taxpayer expense was just an election stunt, the action of a would-be strongman trying to flex his muscles against an invisible and unarmed foe.
Trump’s attitude toward the border led in late November to one of the most deeply troubling moments of his whole administration, when American border patrol forces fired tear-gas into a crowd of migrants including women and small children in Tijuana, on the Mexican side of the border with California.
This awful scene led to administration surrogates tying themselves in knots trying once more to defend the indefensible, with one even saying that the pepper-spray used was so safe that “you can actually put it on your nachos and eat it.”
The whole debacle was already indefensible, but it is even more so now that we know that the whole grand theatrical event is costing US taxpayers such a colossal amount of money."
progressive,"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/10/13226264/us-crime-rate-poll
","Since the 1990s, crime rates in the US have plummeted — with the murder and violent crime rates dropping by more than half.
Americans, it turns out, have no idea.
A new Vox/Morning Consult poll measured how nearly 2,000 registered voters perceive crime both in their neighborhoods and in America more broadly.
The poll found that 69 percent of US voters think there is more crime in the US than there was two decades ago, with 43 percent saying there is “much more” crime and 26 percent saying there is “somewhat more” crime.
Broken down into specific crimes, a majority of Americans said there was more violent crime, drug crime, theft, and white-collar crime.
In reality, various types of crime have plummeted, based on the official FBI figures. The violent crime rate has fallen by more than half, with the murder rate dropping from 9.8 per 100,000 people in 1991 and 8.2 in 1995 to 4.9 in 2015. Rape, robbery, burglary, and theft rates have all also dropped. (There aren’t good statistics for drug and white-collar crimes.)
Rates of crime, particularly murder, did go up in 2015 compared with 2014, but only after 2014 saw the lowest levels of crime in decades. (We don’t really know why the murder rate in particular rose sharply from 2014 to 2015. For more, read Vox’s explainer.)
But Americans were in fact less likely to say crime had dramatically risen in the past year than they were when comparing crime rates with those of two decades ago. The poll found that while 69 percent of voters said that crime had risen in the past year, only 36 percent said there was “much more” crime and 33 percent said there was “somewhat more” crime compared with one year ago.
Americans also don’t seem to realize what types of crime have risen in the past year, with roughly the same saying that rates of violent crime and theft have gone up over the past year. In reality, property crime rates in 2015 dropped to the lowest point since any time after 1966 — while it’s violent crimes that went up for the year.
Americans think their neighborhoods are safer than the US as a whole
Despite the fairly negative outlook voters seem to have on safety across the country as a whole, they have sunnier views of the places they have a more direct experience with: their neighborhoods.
When asked about crime in their neighborhoods, only 37 percent said it was higher than it was a year ago. A greater proportion of voters (39 percent) said it was about the same, while 17 percent said it was less.
But they were a little more pessimistic about the long-term trend: 42 percent said there was more crime in their neighborhoods compared with two decades ago, while 23 percent said it was about the same and 17 percent said it was less.
This is very typical for this type of polling. For decades, Gallup has asked Americans if they think crime has gone up over the past year in their area and the US. Generally, Americans are much more likely to tell Gallup that crime has increased in the country as a whole than they are for their neighborhoods.
There’s a simple explanation for why: Since crime really has been dropping, Americans are very likely to see the improvement in their neighborhoods. But once pollsters start to pull out to bigger, more abstract concepts — crime in the whole country or over the past couple of decades — respondents are likely relying on foggier memories and feelings that reflect more what they see in the news, which tends to be pretty grim, than what they’ve experienced firsthand.
Americans’ inability to recognize the crime drop could have bad policy consequences
Whatever the explanation, these poll results are likely bad news for criminal justice reformers.
Over the past few years, there has been a concerted push to reduce America’s massive prison population. There’s a very good reason for that: America locks up people at a higher rate than any other country in the world, save the tiny African country of Seychelles. And the criminal justice research strongly suggests that the high imprisonment rate is not actually making the country safer, but it is costing us a lot — about $80 billion a year — to keep all these people in prison.
As a previous poll by Morning Consult and Vox found, Americans are generally likely to support reducing the prison population — but only for nonviolent offenses. One reason for that is Americans may think the country’s violent crime rates are still trending in the wrong direction — making them cautious of taking any steps that could, in their views, heighten the risk of more crime.
The reality is, of course, different. But if Americans don’t know that, then policymakers may be skeptical of making changes that could inspire backlash from a misinformed electorate.
Morning Consult polled 1,989 registered voters on October 5 and 6, 2016. The interviews were conducted using large, established online survey vendors and were weighted to approximate a target sample of registered voters based on age, race/ethnicity, gender, educational attainment, region, annual household income, homeownership status, and marital status. Results from the full survey have a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points. Topline results are available here, and cross-tabulation results are available here."
progressive,"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-12-14/editorial-universal-mail-ballots-are-one-pandemic-measure-worth-keeping-permanently
","Though it may be hard to imagine now, sometime in the not distant future, the emergency measures adopted this year to control the spread of COVID-19 will no longer be necessary. But California would benefit by keeping at least one of them in place for good: mailing a ballot to every active registered voter in the state.
When it became clear this spring that the pandemic was not likely to end before the Nov. 3 election, lawmakers acted to ensure that all active registered voters in California could participate without risking infection. Counties were directed to mail ballots to all voters, whether they requested one or not, and, with an onslaught of mail ballots expected, were allowed to start processing ballots extra early. The state also extended the grace period for mailed-in ballots to 17 days.
It was a wise move that paid off. By all measures, the Nov. 3 election in California was held successfully, despite all the wild-eyed stories and false tales of mail ballot fraud spread by the president and his loyalists. (In the end, the only potential large-scale voting fraud in California was perpetrated by the California Republican Party, which set up dozens of phony ballot drop boxes in violation of state law. )
Nearly 18 million Californians voted in this election, more than ever before. So many Californians voted early — motivated, perhaps, by the stories about possible mail delivery delays — that election day was relatively calm, with only a few long lines reported around the state. This is exactly how every election should go, pandemic or not. Why backtrack now?
Advertisement
That’s what Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), chairman of the Assembly Elections Committee, thinks too. He has proposed legislation to require counties to automatically send mail ballots to all active registered voters (some already do) and to offer tracking services so voters can make sure their ballots are received. This wouldn’t end in-person voting for those who need assistance or enjoy casting their ballot in the company of others, but it would let voters easily choose how and where they vote.
This change would only hasten a trend well underway in California. In the last four statewide general elections, most voters used mail ballots. Even without the emergency legislation this year, about 75% of the state’s voters would have been mailed a ballot, and about 90% of registered voters would be receiving a mail ballot in future elections, according to the Secretary of State’s office.
It just makes sense to standardize this clearly popular voting choice. It’s where California has been headed since the Legislature passed the Voter’s Choice Act in 2016 and allowed counties to ditch the traditional model of in-person voting on election day at many small precincts in favor of centralized vote centers where ballots could be dropped off or cast in person well in advance. Fifteen counties, Los Angeles County among them, have adopted those provisions.
But we need ballot drop boxes too. The Voter’s Choice Act doesn’t require counties to deploy them, but drop boxes should be mandatory if we move to universal mail ballots. In Los Angeles County, drop boxes were wildly popular — more than half of the 3.4 million mail ballots cast in the Nov. 3 election were collected that way.
Advertisement
Another election problem that lawmakers should fix: This year’s emergency arrangement notwithstanding, California law provides a grace period of only three days for ballots to arrive after the election (they must be postmarked by election day to be counted). That seems too short, given that it takes the Postal Service up to a week to deliver first-class mail.
And for heaven’s sake, lawmakers really ought to revise the 2016 law that allows unlimited third-party collection of ballots, or “ballot harvesting.” Previously, only a member of the family or household could deliver a ballot on behalf of a registered voter. We were worried about the potential for misuse even before it was used to justify the GOP’s fake drop boxes. We have no doubt that in future elections, there will be other creative uses of this law that undermine trust in democracy.
While we’re making an election reform wish list, Congress should use its authority over the “times, places and manner” of federal elections to standardize procedures for collecting and processing mail ballots. Ideally, those standards would look like those in California, where officials have gone out of their way to make voting easier and smoother — and are still looking for ways to do it better."

","Millions of phony accounts. Fake bank card PIN numbers. Fictitious email accounts.
Wells Fargo admitted to firing 5,300 employees for engaging in these shocking tactics. The bank earlier this month paid $185 million in penalties and has since apologized.
Now CNNMoney is hearing from former Wells Fargo (WFC) workers around the country who tried to put a stop to these illegal tactics. Almost half a dozen workers who spoke with us say they paid dearly for trying to do the right thing: they were fired.
""They ruined my life,"" Bill Bado, a former Wells Fargo banker in Pennsylvania, told CNNMoney.
Bado not only refused orders to open phony bank and credit accounts. The New Jersey man called an ethics hotline and sent an email to human resources in September 2013, flagging unethical sales activities he was being instructed to do.
Eight days after that email, a copy of which CNNMoney obtained, Bado was terminated. The stated reason? Tardiness.

HR official describes 'retaliation'
Retaliating against whistleblowers is a major breach of trust. Ethics hotlines are exactly the kind of safeguards put in place to prevent illegal activity from taking place and provide refuge to employees from dangerous work environments.
Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf made precisely that point on Tuesday when he testified before angry Senators.
""Each team member, no matter where you are in the organization, is encouraged to raise their hands,"" Stumpf told lawmakers. He mentioned the anonymous ethics line, adding, ""We want to hear from them.""
But that's not the experience of some former Wells Fargo workers.
One former Wells Fargo human resources official even said the bank had a method in place to retaliate against tipsters. He said that Wells Fargo would find ways to fire employees ""in retaliation for shining light"" on sales issues. It could be as simple as monitoring the employee to find a fault, like showing up a few minutes late on several occasions.
""If this person was supposed to be at the branch at 8:30 a.m. and they showed up at 8:32 a.m, they would fire them,"" the former human resources official told CNNMoney, on the condition he remain anonymous out of fear for his career.
CNNMoney spoke to a total of four ex-Wells Fargo workers, including Bado, who believe they were fired because they tipped off the bank about unethical sales practices.
Another six former Wells Fargo employees told CNNMoney they witnessed similar behavior at Wells Fargo -- even though the company has a policy in place that is supposed to prevent retaliation against whistleblowers. CNNMoney has taken steps to confirm that the workers who spoke anonymously did work at Wells Fargo and in some cases interviewed colleagues who corroborated their reports.
It's possible Wells Fargo could face legal consequences for any retaliation that occurred against employees who called the ethics line.
""It is clearly against the law for any company (or executives of such companies) to try to suppress whistleblowing,"" Harvey Pitt, former chairman of the SEC, told CNNMoney in an email.
A number of statutes -- including Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank -- ""make this unambiguously clear,"" Pitt said.
""I endured harsh bullying ... defamation of character, and eventually being pinned for something I didn't do,"" said Heather Brock, who was fired earlier this month as a senior business banker at a Wells Fargo branch in Round Rock, Texas.

'That's retaliation'
One such former employee was fired after flagging issues directly to Stumpf, according to Senator Bob Menendez.
At the Senate hearing, Menendez read the New Jersey woman's 2011 email to Stumpf, where she described improper sales tactics she felt were ""wrong.""
""Did you read that email?"" Menendez asked Stumpf.
""I don't remember that one,"" Stumpf replied.
""Okay, well she was fired. ... So much for the safe haven,"" Menendez said.
Several senators spoke about the plight of the mostly 5,300, low-level employees who were fired related to the scandal.
The firing certainly took a huge toll on Bado's life. It put a permanent stain on his securities license, scaring off other prospective bank employers. Today, the New Jersey man's house is on the verge of being foreclosed on and he's working part-time, at Shop-Rite.
""You wonder where the justice is,"" Bado said.
Ken Springer, a former FBI agent who runs a firm that offers a whistleblower hotline service, was alarmed by the allegations made by former Wells Fargo employees.
""That's retaliation. It's a big problem -- and a perfect example of what shouldn't happen,"" Springer said. ""It looks like there's been a terrible breakdown of checks and balances at Wells Fargo.""
In response to CNNMoney's report, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman said: ""We do not tolerate retaliation against team members who report their concerns in good faith."" She emphasized that employees are encouraged to immediately report unethical behavior to their manager, HR representative or 24-hour ethics line.

'Excessive tardiness' eight days after HR email
Wells Fargo confirmed to CNNMoney that Bado had worked there. However, the bank declined to comment on why Bado left and and on the ethics complaint with corresponding report number he cited in emails. ""Everything submitted to the EthicsLine is investigated,"" a Wells Fargo spokeswoman said.
While ethics complaints are supposed to be confidential, documents show that Bado did speak out before he was fired. On September 19, 2013, Bado wrote an email to a Wells Fargo HR rep and copied his regional manager, where he detailed improper sales tactics.
Documents show Bado was fired -- for ""excessive tardiness"" -- just eight days later.
""I have been asked on several occasions to do things that I know are not ethical and would be grounds for discharge,"" Bado said in the email to HR.
He said a branch manager on ""many occasions"" asked him to send out a debit card, ""pin it,"" and enroll customers in online banking -- ""all without the customers (sic) request or knowledge."" Those are precisely the same practices that regulators fined Wells Fargo for three years later and that senators grilled the bank over this week.
Lose, lose situation for Heather Brock
Brock, the business banker from Texas, told CNNMoney she experienced a similar situation. The 26-year-old single parent of two young boys was fired soon after she contacted the company's ethics line about illegal sales practices she witnessed.
Wells Fargo also confirmed Brock used to work at the company but declined to comment further.
Brock was fired earlier this month, with Wells Fargo accusing her of falsifying documents -- a charge Brock emphatically denies. Brock said the company bullied her into admitting she did something wrong.
A current Wells Fargo employee who works in Brock's branch vouched for her version of events.
""That's really scary when you're with a big corporation like this and HR doesn't have your back,"" said the current employee, who wished to remain anonymous so as not to get fired as well.
Brock is hoping her story forces meaningful change at Wells Fargo.
""You lose if you do complain and you lose if you don't. What does a powerless employee do?"" Brock said.

","Shocking footage has emerged in the US that appears to show a Kentucky fire chief refusing to provide assistance to a family involved in a road traffic accident because they are black.
The video, captured on the body camera of a police officer for the Bullitt County Sheriff’s department, purports to show Southeast Bullitt Fire Chief Julius Hatfield responding to an accident involving a white man in a pickup truck and a black family of four.
According to WDRB News, which obtained the video, the initial stages show Hatfield offering to help change the tyre on Loren Dicken’s pickup to “save [him] a bill”.
Hatfield is then showed Dicken to a waiting ambulance and, according to WDRB News, he saw that the white crash victim was picked up from hospital by firefighters and taken to the local station, where his car was waiting for him.
By contrast, the video shows Hatfield standing by and saying nothing as Chege Mwangi, the black driver involved in the crash, tells police he has no roadside assistance to help with his damaged vehicle.
A police officer can later be heard saying on the radio that he has “a family of four from Cincinnati, I got to do something with”, to which a voice, reported by WDRB News to be that of Hatfield, responds: “We ain’t taking no n*****s here.”
Mr Mwangi told WDRB News that he noticed at the time he wasn’t receiving the same treatment from the fire department as the other crash victim, but that he thought little of it since neither he nor his wife nor his two children were injured.

WDRB News said the sheriff’s department had confirmed that the voice heard in the video was Hatfield’s. It also confirmed that, while it is bleeped out in the footage, the term he used was a racist slur."

","The last time Republicans obtained unified control of the federal government, after the 2002 midterms, they immediately set out to pass a large tax cut on dividend and capital gains income. The theory was that by making it more lucrative to invest in American businesses, they would boost business investment in the United States — making our country home to more factories and offices, driving job creation, and pushing up wages.
What happened instead was a weak, highly inegalitarian period of economic growth that was associated with the drift of America’s manufacturing base overseas and an unsustainable debt-financed boom in house building. It ended in tears, Barack Obama served as president for eight years, and then Donald Trump — having earlier toppled the GOP establishment in a tumultuous primary — became president and restored unified GOP control of the federal government for the first time since 2006.
Back in power, the new “populist” GOP is pushing the exact same economic strategy. This time, instead of aiming to slash dividend and capital gains taxes that are levied on people who own shares of stock in big companies, they are directly slashing the corporate income tax paid by those companies. But the effect — by design — is exactly the same. The idea is that by making it more profitable to own American companies, you will juice business investment in the United States.
The reality is that if we do the exact same thing we did when George W. Bush was president, we will likely get the exact same results — an inegalitarian growth pattern, an uncompetitive currency that hurts American manufacturing, and an economy based on rich people lending money to middle-class people so they can buy houses. Since the influx of foreign money that props up the whole machine can’t last forever, we should expect it to end it tears just like it did the last time.
The wonk’s case for Trump’s tax cut
While Republican politicians lie about what their tax bill does, right-of-center wonks are coming together to argue that liberal commentators are ignoring the allegedly strong case on the merits. Not many people would go so far as White House Council of Economic Advisers Chair Kevin Hassett, who promises that a big corporate tax cut will raise wages by $4,000 per year, but plenty are willing to argue that Hassett is at least directionally correct.
Tyler Cowen, the George Mason University economist, argued in Bloomberg that “Republicans have the science on their side” when they argue that a corporate tax cut would boost investment and wages.
After all, writes Harvard professor and New York Times columnist Greg Mankiw, “we live in a world where capital flows from country to country, seeking the highest after-tax return.” Consequently, “when a multinational company is deciding where to put its next capital project, the corporate tax is one factor affecting its decision.”
Mankiw, not coincidentally, was Hassett’s predecessor at CEA when George W. Bush was president. And while the Bush administration didn’t try to make America more investor-friendly by cutting the corporate income tax rate, it did push through major legislation to cut the taxes paid on dividend and capital gains income, which is another way of accomplishing the same thing. The Bush era did not, of course, see a huge increase in American businesses’ competitiveness on the world stage. Instead, Bush-era economic growth, though real, was highly inegalitarian. Manufacturing tended to move overseas to Asia. Domestic asset prices soared, leading to a house-building boom that eventually ended in a crash.
And if you look beyond the bloodless mathematical models, the science says we should expect a repeat of Bush’s economic development playbook to lead to a repeat of Bush’s results.
The mobile kind of capital is money
Mankiw’s account of this perfectly displays a kind of mischief in economic models around the word “capital.” Capital — in the guise of Mankiw’s “capital projects” — plays a key role in production functions. A worker with no capital is just a guy standing on the street corner uselessly. To make things and earn a wage, he needs access to some capital goods — a factory, an office building, a farm, and a bunch of equipment — and the more capital there is to go around, the more he can make and the higher the wage he can earn.
But when Mankiw says that capital “flows from country to country,” he obviously doesn’t mean that actual factories move from Slovakia to Shenzhen to Seattle, relentlessly seeking their highest rate of return.
Capital goods are extremely immobile and tend to stay exactly where they are, whether they are earning a high rate of return or not — Detroit is full of abandoned building because the actual capital goods can’t go to Tennessee or Mexico or wherever the auto jobs may be.
The mobile, flowing kind of capital that roams the globe seeking a high rate of return is money. If America cuts its dividend and capital gains tax rates, then it makes sense for people to move money out of foreign stock markets and into the American stock market. That’s what we did during the Bush administration. It didn’t work to generate widely shared prosperity, but instead of giving up, Republicans have repackaged the same idea as a tax cut on business profits — which amounts to the exact same thing. Again, increasing the after-tax return on owning shares in American companies should make more people want to move money into the American stock market. If that strategy works at all, it should “work” in roughly the way it did for Bush.
Think through what an influx of foreign money means
Conservative wonks like to dangle images of companies taking advantage of the big new influx of funds to build factories and hire workers, because that paints an appealing picture of what the strategy amounts to.
But try to think this through.
If the global investor class decides to shift money into American investment assets, the proximate result will be to bid up the price of the dollar. This will, mechanically, create higher wages for most people in the sense that manufactured goods built in Asia will become cheaper. But it will also lead factories in the United States to close — not open — as made-in-America products become uncompetitive on the global market.
Meanwhile, about half the population owns no stock, while the top 1 percent of the population owns 38 percent of the value of American shares. The next 9 percent of the income distribution owns 44 percent of the stock value. So the share price boost would be a huge win for the top 10 percent (and especially the top 1 percent), while doing nothing at all for the bottom 50 and offering only a minor boost to those who are above average but not rich.
Get ready for housing boom 2.0
With the foreign investment boom simultaneously fueling low interest rates, creating high housing prices, and idling working-class men from manufacturing jobs, the stage will be set for the country to start a residential investment boom.
Coastal areas may be zoned out of the ability to unleash new construction, but Sunbelt suburbs from Las Vegas to Orlando have the right mix of space and lax regulation to grow. Not everyone will move into a brand new home, of course. The same fundamental dynamics will be a spur to the construction of new additions, new decks and patios, or even just refinancing to get the kitchen modernized and upgraded.
The problems with this growth model should have been visible in the mid-aughts, but they definitely should be visible in retrospect.
For starters, even though houses are useful, they’re not productive in the same way that business equipment is. A house won’t create new industries for Americans to work in, or build the great companies of tomorrow that sell things all around the world. Building more houses in the exorbitantly expensive housing markets around the Bay Area, New York, and Boston would increase the dynamism of a few of America’s key economic hubs, but that’s a regulatory issue, not something that an influx of foreign money will fix. If America isn’t going to add houses in the places where the dynamic industries are, what it needs to do is add dynamic industries in the places where the housing supply can grow — simply stuffing more housing into places that lack good-paying jobs doesn’t accomplish very much.
But beyond that, an economic model in which the rich get richer and then the middle class maintains its living standards by borrowing money from the rich can really only end one way. As long as the capital keeps flowing in from abroad, everything’s fine, but when the music stops, you’re due for a banking crisis.
Let’s solve some real problems
A useful sanity check on the theory that what America needs is for more foreign money to be stuffed into our financial markets is to check out MySubscriptionAddiction.com, a site that rounds up the latest and greatest offerings in the very hot startup category of sending people boxes of stuff in the mail.
The Modern Mystic “is a monthly subscription that delivers you an entire tarot reading … in a box!”
FabKids will, for the low price of $29.95 per month, send you some boys’ outfits.
Field to Cup is basically a tea-of-the-month club.
“CultureFly (the team behind the Pusheen Box, The Nick Box, DC Comics World’s Finest: The Collection) has a new quarterly mystery subscription box for Supernatural fans – Supernatural Box!”
Foot Cardigan sends you socks in the mail.
You’re never going to have a dynamic market economy without letting a certain number of entrepreneurs with dumb ideas take money from dumb investors to sell dumb products. After all, if it were obvious which the good ideas were, we’d hardly need any new ideas. But the proliferation of lame subscription box startups naturally raises the question of whether we really believe, as a society, that there are tons of great ideas out there that are currently starved of investment funds due to America’s failure to make its tax code sufficiently friendly to business owners.
By contrast, America really does have a bunch of serious problems that would be worth tackling:
There is an acute scarcity of housing units in most of America’s most prosperous metropolitan areas.
The process of regional convergence by which poor parts of the country have historically grown faster than rich ones has halted and may even be reversing — with communities built around now-shuttered factories especially lacking in opportunity.
Opioid overdoses have reached an unprecedented level and show no sign of slowing down.
Greenhouse gases emitted as a byproduct of fossil fuel consumption are putting the planet on a trajectory for unsustainable levels of warming.
Despite a fairly high college enrollment rate by international standards, the large share of Americans who don’t finish their degrees has left us with a mediocre ranking in terms of college completion and a lot of people saddled with useless debt loads.
Exorbitant child care costs are limiting women’s ability to fully participate in the workforce as well as limiting families’ ability to have as many children as they say they’d like.
Reasonable people can and do disagree about exactly what should be done to solve these problems. And that’s as it should be. But it’s plain as day that a big cut in corporate taxes isn’t going to help with any of this, and that starving the federal government of funds by enacting a big corporate tax cut could hurt on several fronts. On the other hand, a big corporate tax cut will definitely generate some windfall profits for already-rich people who already own lots of stock — people like Donald Trump and the Republican Party donor class.
.@RepChrisCollins (R-NY) on tax reform: ""My donors are basically saying, 'Get it done or don’t ever call me again.'"" — Cristina Marcos (@cimarcos) November 7, 2017
When Republicans explain that this push is a gift to their donors and not the instantiation of a high-minded theory of how to generate long-term economic growth, we should consider believing them."

A former Blackwater employee and an ex-US Marine who has worked as a security operative for the company have made a series of explosive allegations in sworn statements filed on August 3 in federal court in Virginia. The two men claim that the company’s owner, Erik Prince, may have murdered or facilitated the murder of individuals who were cooperating with federal authorities investigating the company. The former employee also alleges that Prince “views himself as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe,” and that Prince’s companies “encouraged and rewarded the destruction of Iraqi life.”
In their testimony, both men also allege that Blackwater was smuggling weapons into Iraq. One of the men alleges that Prince turned a profit by transporting “illegal” or “unlawful” weapons into the country on Prince’s private planes. They also charge that Prince and other Blackwater executives destroyed incriminating videos, emails and other documents and have intentionally deceived the US State Department and other federal agencies. The identities of the two individuals were sealed out of concern for their safety.
These allegations and a series of other charges are contained in sworn affidavits, given under penalty of perjury, filed late at night on August 3 in the Eastern District of Virginia as part of a 70-page motion by lawyers for Iraqi civilians suing Blackwater for alleged war crimes and other misconduct. Susan Burke, a private attorney working in conjunction with the Center for Constitutional Rights, is suing Blackwater in five separate civil cases filed in the Washington, DC, area. They were recently consolidated before Judge T.S. Ellis III of the Eastern District of Virginia for pretrial motions. Burke filed the August 3 motion in response to Blackwater’s motion to dismiss the case. Blackwater asserts that Prince and the company are innocent of any wrongdoing and that they were professionally performing their duties on behalf of their employer, the US State Department.
The former employee, identified in the court documents as “John Doe #2,” is a former member of Blackwater’s management team, according to a source close to the case. Doe #2 alleges in a sworn declaration that, based on information provided to him by former colleagues, “it appears that Mr. Prince and his employees murdered, or had murdered, one or more persons who have provided information, or who were planning to provide information, to the federal authorities about the ongoing criminal conduct.” John Doe #2 says he worked at Blackwater for four years; his identity is concealed in the sworn declaration because he “fear[s] violence against me in retaliation for submitting this Declaration.” He also alleges, “On several occasions after my departure from Mr. Prince’s employ, Mr. Prince’s management has personally threatened me with death and violence.”
In a separate sworn statement, the former US marine who worked for Blackwater in Iraq alleges that he has “learned from my Blackwater colleagues and former colleagues that one or more persons who have provided information, or who were planning to provide information about Erik Prince and Blackwater have been killed in suspicious circumstances.” Identified as “John Doe #1,” he says he “joined Blackwater and deployed to Iraq to guard State Department and other American government personnel.” It is not clear if Doe #1 is still working with the company as he states he is “scheduled to deploy in the immediate future to Iraq.” Like Doe #2, he states that he fears “violence” against him for “submitting this Declaration.” No further details on the alleged murder(s) are provided.
“Mr. Prince feared, and continues to fear, that the federal authorities will detect and prosecute his various criminal deeds,” states Doe #2. “On more than one occasion, Mr. Prince and his top managers gave orders to destroy emails and other documents. Many incriminating videotapes, documents and emails have been shredded and destroyed.”
The Nation cannot independently verify the identities of the two individuals, their roles at Blackwater, or what motivated them to provide sworn testimony in these civil cases. Both individuals state that they have previously cooperated with federal prosecutors conducting a criminal inquiry into Blackwater.
“It’s a pending investigation, so we cannot comment on any matters in front of a grand jury or if a grand jury even exists on these matters,” John Roth, the spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, told The Nation. “It would be a crime if we did that.” Asked specifically about whether there is a criminal investigation into Prince regarding the murder allegations and other charges, Roth said, “We would not be able to comment on what we are or are not doing in regards to any possible investigation involving an uncharged individual.”
The Nation repeatedly attempted to contact spokespeople for Prince or his companies at numerous e-mail addresses and telephone numbers. When a company representative was reached by phone and asked to comment, she said, “Unfortunately no one can help you in that area.” The representative then said that she would pass along The Nation’s request. As this article goes to press, no company representative has responded further to The Nation.
Doe #2 states in the declaration that he has also provided the information contained in his statement “in grand jury proceedings convened by the United States Department of Justice.” Federal prosecutors convened a grand jury in the aftermath of the September 16, 2007, Nisour Square shootings in Baghdad, which left seventeen Iraqis dead. Five Blackwater employees are awaiting trial on several manslaughter charges and a sixth, Jeremy Ridgeway, has already pleaded guilty to manslaughter and attempting to commit manslaughter and is cooperating with prosecutors. It is not clear whether Doe #2 testified in front of the Nisour Square grand jury or in front of a separate grand jury.
The two declarations are each five pages long and contain a series of devastating allegations concerning Erik Prince and his network of companies, which now operate under the banner of Xe Services LLC. Among those leveled by Doe #2 is that Prince “views himself as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe”:
To that end, Mr. Prince intentionally deployed to Iraq certain men who shared his vision of Christian supremacy, knowing and wanting these men to take every available opportunity to murder Iraqis. Many of these men used call signs based on the Knights of the Templar, the warriors who fought the Crusades.
Mr. Prince operated his companies in a manner that encouraged and rewarded the destruction of Iraqi life. For example, Mr. Prince’s executives would openly speak about going over to Iraq to “lay Hajiis out on cardboard.” Going to Iraq to shoot and kill Iraqis was viewed as a sport or game. Mr. Prince’s employees openly and consistently used racist and derogatory terms for Iraqis and other Arabs, such as “ragheads” or “hajiis.”
Among the additional allegations made by Doe #1 is that “Blackwater was smuggling weapons into Iraq.” He states that he personally witnessed weapons being “pulled out” from dog-food bags. Doe #2 alleges that “Prince and his employees arranged for the weapons to be polywrapped and smuggled into Iraq on Mr. Prince’s private planes, which operated under the name Presidential Airlines,” adding that Prince “generated substantial revenues from participating in the illegal arms trade.”
Doe #2 states: “Using his various companies, [Prince] procured and distributed various weapons, including unlawful weapons such as sawed off semi-automatic machine guns with silencers, through unlawful channels of distribution.” Blackwater “was not abiding by the terms of the contract with the State Department and was deceiving the State Department,” according to Doe #1.
This is not the first time an allegation has surfaced that Blackwater used dog-food bags to smuggle weapons into Iraq. ABC News’s Brian Ross reported in November 2008 that a “federal grand jury in North Carolina is investigating allegations the controversial private security firm Blackwater illegally shipped assault weapons and silencers to Iraq, hidden in large sacks of dog food.” Another former Blackwater employee has also confirmed this information to The Nation.
Both individuals allege that Prince and Blackwater deployed individuals to Iraq who, in the words of Doe #1, “were not properly vetted and cleared by the State Department.” Doe #2 adds that “Prince ignored the advice and pleas from certain employees, who sought to stop the unnecessary killing of innocent Iraqis.” Doe #2 further states that some Blackwater officials overseas refused to deploy “unfit men” and sent them back to the US. Among the reasons cited by Doe #2 were “the men making statements about wanting to deploy to Iraq to ‘kill ragheads’ or achieve ‘kills’ or ‘body counts,'” as well as “excessive drinking” and “steroid use.” However, when the men returned to the US, according to Doe #2, “Prince and his executives would send them back to be deployed in Iraq with an express instruction to the concerned employees located overseas that they needed to ‘stop costing the company money.’”
Doe #2 also says Prince “repeatedly ignored the assessments done by mental health professionals, and instead terminated those mental health professionals who were not willing to endorse deployments of unfit men.” He says Prince and then-company president Gary Jackson “hid from Department of State the fact that they were deploying men to Iraq over the objections of mental health professionals and security professionals in the field,” saying they “knew the men being deployed were not suitable candidates for carrying lethal weaponry, but did not care because deployments meant more money.”
Doe #1 states that “Blackwater knew that certain of its personnel intentionally used excessive and unjustified deadly force, and in some instances used unauthorized weapons, to kill or seriously injure innocent Iraqi civilians.” He concludes, “Blackwater did nothing to stop this misconduct.” Doe #1 states that he “personally observed multiple incidents of Blackwater personnel intentionally using unnecessary, excessive and unjustified deadly force.” He then cites several specific examples of Blackwater personnel firing at civilians, killing or “seriously” wounding them, and failing to report the shootings to the State Department.
Doe #1 also alleges that “all of these incidents of excessive force were initially videotaped and voice recorded” but that “immediately after the day concluded, we would watch the video in a session called a ‘hot wash.’ Immediately after the hotwashing, the video was erased to prevent anyone other than Blackwater personnel seeing what had actually occurred.” Blackwater, he says, “did not provide the video to the State Department.”
Doe #2 expands on the issue of unconventional weapons, alleging Prince “made available to his employees in Iraq various weapons not authorized by the United States contracting authorities, such as hand grenades and hand grenade launchers. Mr. Prince’s employees repeatedly used this illegal weaponry in Iraq, unnecessarily killing scores of innocent Iraqis.” Specifically, he alleges that Prince “obtained illegal ammunition from an American company called LeMas. This company sold ammunition designed to explode after penetrating within the human body. Mr. Prince’s employees repeatedly used this illegal ammunition in Iraq to inflict maximum damage on Iraqis.”
Blackwater has gone through an intricate rebranding process in the twelve years it has been in business, changing its name and logo several times. Prince also has created more than a dozen affiliate companies, some of which are registered offshore and whose operations are shrouded in secrecy. According to Doe #2, “Prince created and operated this web of companies in order to obscure wrongdoing, fraud and other crimes.”
“For example, Mr. Prince transferred funds from one company (Blackwater) to another (Greystone) whenever necessary to avoid detection of his money laundering and tax evasion schemes.” He added: “Mr. Prince contributed his personal wealth to fund the operations of the Prince companies whenever he deemed such funding necessary. Likewise, Mr. Prince took funds out of the Prince companies and placed the funds in his personal accounts at will.”
Briefed on the substance of these allegations by The Nation, Congressman Dennis Kucinich replied, “If these allegations are true, Blackwater has been a criminal enterprise defrauding taxpayers and murdering innocent civilians.” Kucinich is on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and has been investigating Prince and Blackwater since 2004.
“Blackwater is a law unto itself, both internationally and domestically. The question is why they operated with impunity. In addition to Blackwater, we should be questioning their patrons in the previous administration who funded and employed this organization. Blackwater wouldn’t exist without federal patronage; these allegations should be thoroughly investigated,” Kucinich said.
A hearing before Judge Ellis in the civil cases against Blackwater is scheduled for August 7."

","It is becoming increasingly likely that, come Christmas Eve, Scott Walker, the goggle-eyed homunculus hired by Koch Industries to manage their Midwest subsidiary formerly known as the state of Wisconsin, will be visited by three very angry spirits—the Ghosts of Christmas Past, the Ghost Of Christmas Present, and the Ghost Of Let Me Hit You With This Croquet Mallet.
The 2013-15 state budget created a rule for some recipients of the state's food stamp program known as FoodShare: If you're an able-bodied adult without children living at home, you must work at least 80 hours a month or look for work to stay in the program. That rule went into effect in April, and between July and September, about 25 percent of the 60,000 recipients eligible to work were dropped from the program when the penalty took effect, according to DHS data. Meanwhile, about 4,500 recipients found work through a new job training program for FoodShare recipients. Participants can get three months of FoodShare benefits before being kicked out of the program if they decline to look for work.
It is an article of rightwing faith that churches and other private institutions do a better job of charity work than does the government, which encourages ""dependency"" or some such. Of course, when the state throws up its hands, it causes chaos in the soup kitchens and food pantries as well.
""They will bankrupt our food banks,"" said Sherrie Tussler, executive director of the Milwaukee-based Hunger Task Force, a supplier of food pantries, soup kitchens and homeless shelters with emergency food. In Wisconsin, about 770,000 people receive FoodShare benefits as of September, according to DHS. The law automatically enrolls eligible recipients in a program designed to help them find employment called the FoodShare Employment and Training program. Since the new law took effect, just 7 percent of recipients in Milwaukee County—where about half of the able-bodied childless adult recipients live—that were referred to the program were placed in jobs, state data show.
This is stupid. This is cruel. You rig your state's economy so that jobs flee by the thousands and then you tie food stamps to employment and—presto!—you've ""cut government spending."" Merry Christmas, all ye poor people of Wisconsin. You are nothing but a line item now.

","The following story first appeared in the Texas Observer. Check out their website for more great stories.
I have received permission to share my patients’ stories, and changed or omitted some names. This is a personal essay; the views are my own and do not reflect those of St. Vincent’s House or St. Vincent’s Student-Run Free Clinic.
The first patient who called me “doctor” died a few winters ago. I met him at the St. Vincent’s Student-Run Free Clinic on Galveston Island. I was a first-year medical student then, and the disease in his body baffled me. His belly was swollen, his eyes were yellow and his blood tests were all awry. It hurt when he swallowed and his urine stank.
I saw him every Thursday afternoon. I would do a physical exam, talk to him, and consult with the doctor. We ran blood counts and wrote a prescription for an antacid—not the best medication, but one you can get for $4 a month. His disease seemed serious, but we couldn’t diagnose him at the free clinic because the tests needed to do so—a CT scan, a biopsy of the liver, a test to look for cancer cells in the fluid in his belly—are beyond our financial reach.
He started calling me “Dr. Rachel.” When his pain got so bad that he couldn’t eat, we decided to send him to the emergency room. It was not an easy decision.
There’s a popular myth that the uninsured—in Texas, that’s 25 percent of us—can always get medical care through emergency rooms. Ted Cruz has argued that it is “much cheaper to provide emergency care than it is to expand Medicaid,” and Rick Perry has claimed that Texans prefer the ER system. The myth is based on a 1986 federal law called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which states that hospitals with emergency rooms have to accept and stabilize patients who are in labor or who have an acute medical condition that threatens life or limb. That word “stabilize” is key: Hospital ERs don’t have to treat you. They just have to patch you up to the point where you’re not actively dying. Also, hospitals charge for ER care, and usually send patients to collections when they cannot pay.
My patient went to the ER, but didn’t get treatment. Although he was obviously sick, it wasn’t an emergency that threatened life or limb. He came back to St. Vincent’s, where I went through my routine: conversation, vital signs, physical exam. We laughed a lot, even though we both knew it was a bad situation.
One night, a friend called to say that my patient was in the hospital. He’d finally gotten so anemic that he couldn’t catch his breath, and the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), where I am a student, took him in. My friend emailed me the results of his CT scans: There was cancer in his kidney, his liver and his lungs. It must have been spreading over the weeks that he’d been coming into St. Vincent’s.
I went to visit him that night. “There’s my doctor!” he called out when he saw me. I sat next to him, and he explained that he was waiting to call his sister until they told him whether or not the cancer was “bad.”
“It might be one of those real treatable kinds of cancers,” he said. I nodded uncomfortably. We talked for a while, and when I left he said, “Well now you know where I am, so you can come visit me.”
I never came back. I was too ashamed, and too early in my training to even recognize why I felt that way. After all, I had done everything I could—what did I have to feel ashamed of?
UTMB sent him to hospice, and he died at home a few months later. I read his obituary in the Galveston County Daily News.
The shame has stuck with me through my medical training—not only from my first patient, but from many more. I am now a director of the free clinic. It’s a volunteer position. I love my patients, and I love being able to help many who need primary care: blood pressure control, pap smears, diabetes management. We even do some specialty care. But the free clinic is also where some people learn that there is no hope for the chemotherapy or surgery that they need but can’t afford. When UTMB refuses to treat them, it falls to us to tell them that they will die of diseases that are, in fact, treatable.
St. Vincent’s is the primary care provider for more than 2,000 patients across Southeast Texas. Our catchment area is a strip of coastal plain strung with barrier islands. Drive inland and you start to see live oaks; go toward the coast and the oil refineries loom up over neighborhoods. The most polluting refinery in the nation is here, in Texas City. Our patients are factory workers, laborers, laid-off healthcare workers, the people behind the counters of seafood restaurants.
Most of our patients come from Galveston and Brazoria counties, but some drive two hours from Port Arthur or over from Orange, near the Texas-Louisiana border, to get to us. That’s how hard it is to see a doctor in Southeast Texas: People take a day off work to drive two hours to a student-run clinic that can only provide basic care.
The clinic is overseen by faculty physicians—UTMB docs—who see every patient along with us students and prescribe medications. These doctors are volunteers. We are not a UTMB clinic, but we depend on UTMB, which is twenty blocks from St. Vincent’s, for training our student volunteers, for liability insurance and for running our blood tests and other labs. UTMB has given us grants, including one that helped us get our electronic medical records system, and funds a nurse-managed day clinic for the uninsured at St. Vincent’s House.
But UTMB is no longer the state-subsidized charity hospital it used to be. The changes began before Hurricane Ike in 2008. But after the storm, UTMB administrators drastically cut charity care and moved clinics to the mainland, where there are more paying patients. The old motto “Here for the Health of Texas” was replaced by “Working together to work wonders.” Among those wonders are a new surgical tower and a plan to capitalize on Galveston’s semi-tropical charm by attracting wealthy healthcare tourists from abroad. Medical care for the poor is not, apparently, among the wonders. Whereas UTMB accepted 77 percent of charity referrals in 2005, it was only taking 9 percent in 2011.
UTMB ascribes these changes to financial strain from Hurricane Ike, the county’s inability to negotiate a suitable indigent-care contract and loss of state funding. The state blames budget shortfalls. The Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, could have been a huge relief. However, Gov. Rick Perry rejected billions of dollars in federal funding to expand Medicaid, funding that should have brought access to more than a million Texans, including many St. Vincent’s patients.
Perry’s refusal is catastrophic health policy. For patients, it means that seeking medical care will still require risking bankruptcy, and may lead nowhere. For doctors, the message was not only that our patients’ lives don’t matter, but also that medicine—our old profession, so full of people who genuinely want to help others—will continue to be part of the economic machine that entrenches poverty. When the poor seek our help, they often wind up with crippling debt.
Because they can no longer count on UTMB to accept their patients, UTMB doctors now refer many to St. Vincent’s. They’ll treat someone for a heart attack (because that’s an emergency covered by EMTALA), then refer them to us for follow-up, even though we don’t have a cardiologist. They’ll stabilize a patient after her third stroke, put her on blood thinners and send her to us. They once sent us, from the ER, a man with a broken arm. They put the arm in a splint and referred him to us. What did they expect us to do—orthopedic surgery? Put on a cast? We don’t even have an x-ray machine.
I do not think that these referrals are an official policy. Rather, they are the work of doctors and nurses trying to dosomething for patients who have been refused care through the financial screening process at the hospital. Former St. Vincent’s leader Dr. Merle Lenihan has described the clinic as a “moral safety valve.” It protects UTMB from confronting the consequences of the state’s refusal to provide care.
Among those consequences are the deaths of the poor. As Howard Brody, director of the Institute for the Medical Humanities, has shown, 9,000 Texans per year will die needlessly as a result of our failure to expand Medicaid. However, because dying patients are often too sick, exhausted and wracked with pain to protest, UTMB and states like Texas aren’t forced to reckon with the consequences of their policy decisions.
Because the very sick and the dying may not be able to speak about these issues, health-care providers—particularly the providers of the so-called “safety net”—must do so. It is in our clinics, in the bodies of our patients, where the consequences get played out.
Danielle has schizophrenia, and she’s young, and she struggles with the medications. When we talk, there are long gaps in the conversation where, I think, she hears other voices. In one of these gaps, I notice the sun slanting in where it’s beginning to set beyond the ship channel. There’s gospel music streaming out over the basketball court from the speakers mounted on the side of the community center. I am reminded of what the director of the community center, an Episcopal minister, believes: Every patient is a miracle. The St. Vincent’s House motto is “An oasis of hope, expecting miracles.”
Danielle looks up and stares right at me. “Here’s what I want to know,” she says. “Why are we so poor?”
St. Vincent’s House, which hosts the free clinic, is a historically African-American community center in the lowest-income neighborhood on our island, next to where the housing projects were before they were condemned. The federal government ordered Galveston to rebuild the public housing after Hurricane Ike, but the city refused. We elected a mayor who ran on an explicit anti-public housing platform. Just like the medical system, the city knows whose lives matter.
Now, dandelions grow in the empty lots left after Ike flooded the neighborhood. People sit on the ragged, cracking curbs, and run wheelchairs right down the middle of the street because the sidewalks tend to end in grassy fields or little precipices.
The community center employs a person to stand in the street and walk us to our cars after clinic if we want. Who is he protecting us from, I wonder. Our patients?
In my second year of medical school, I took a small-group course with a famously terrifying surgeon. He told us his moral motto: “A physician never takes away hope.”
I never figured out how that motto could guide doctors through a system where our patients are dying from treatable diseases. Part of my job, it seems, is precisely that: to sit down with patients and, as gently as possible, take away hope.
Consider Vanessa and Jimmy. They met in New Orleans when she was 18. She was working cleaning motels, and he took her on a tour of the tugboat he was captain of. Vanessa says they came to St. Vincent’s because the shipyard Jimmy worked for opted out of providing insurance even for full-time employees like him. They looked for insurance on the open market, but couldn’t afford it.
The Affordable Care Act is supposed to help families like Vanessa and Jimmy get insurance. Folks higher on the income scale should now be able to afford insurance thanks to government subsidies. The poorest of the (legally documented) poor should be covered by Medicaid. And for those people in between, the federal government offered to pay for almost all the costs of expanding Medicaid.
More than a million Texans—and most St. Vincent’s patients—are somewhere in between. They are the working poor, or they are adults without dependent children, who cannot qualify for Medicaid in Texas, no matter how poor they are.
When Jimmy’s labs showed a dangerously high white blood cell count, we sent him to the ER. It was pneumonia, and there was a huge tumor underneath. Current guidelines would recommend screening Jimmy for this kind of cancer every year, but we have neither the equipment nor the funds to offer screening. So it got caught late.
After Jimmy was diagnosed, I helped Vanessa fill out the paperwork to request financial assistance for cancer care. She wanted to know how likely UTMB was to offer her husband assistance he needed.
In addition to only accepting 9 percent of applicants, the charity care approval process is a dark art, and we never know who will be accepted. According to the UTMB Charity Care policy, the institution may consider not only a person’s income and diagnosis, but also such vague qualities as “the history of the problem.” They also consider whether the treatment will offer “educational benefit” to medical students and trainees. Physicians in training have to see a certain number of each type of case. If the programs are hitting quotas with funded patients, patients like Jimmy are less likely to be accepted.
The complexity and vagueness of these policies meant that it was impossible to tell Vanessa how likely UTMB was to take her husband. We can guess around a 10 percent chance, but we never really know.
For patients facing cancer, this is not a hopeful answer.
Vanessa called from a hospital in Houston in early November, distraught, asking me to help her decide whether or not to let the doctors turn Jimmy’s breathing machine off. She was afraid she wouldn’t be able to live with herself, no matter which she chose. I gave her the advice I’d give a friend: that I trusted her love for her husband and her ability to decide from a place of love. Jimmy died late that night.
Vanessa’s request for UTMB funding wasn’t approved. She has received a $17,000 bill from UTMB for the visit when Jimmy went through the ER, and a $327,000 preliminary bill from the Houston hospital.
If the Affordable Care Act had been in effect last year, they would have been able to afford insurance, get treatment early and avoid bankruptcy. I use stories like theirs—cancer stories—when I am encouraging my patients to check out the insurance exchanges.
But with Jimmy gone and Vanessa unemployed, she now falls into the Medicaid coverage gap. I don’t know how she will get care, if she ever needs more than St. Vincent’s can give.
My first patient, the one who died in hospice, might have lived if his cancer had been treated before it had spread from the kidney. But without the Medicaid expansion, the Affordable Care Act wouldn’t help him: As an adult with no dependent children, he wouldn’t qualify for Medicaid now.
In a better medical system, he’d have had a chance at a more dignified experience of illness. He wouldn’t have had to wait for hours in a crowded free clinic, and assume the posture of gratefulness that charity seems to require. He wouldn’t have had to be treated in part by an earnest, but unskilled, first-year medical student. He, like so many Texans, deserved better.
When one of our St. Vincent’s patients gets a bad diagnosis, we start sending faxes: to UTMB, to MD Anderson, to anywhere that might have funds to help them. Sometimes it works out, but often it doesn’t. Sometimes I think of it as “sending faxes into the abyss.” And sometimes I think of it as the slow, diligent, technical way that I have of insisting that these lives matter."

","The federal government is shut down, we’re about to hit the debt ceiling (with disastrous economic consequences), and no resolution is in sight. How did this happen?
The main answer, which only the most pathologically “balanced” reporting can deny, is the radicalization of the Republican Party. As Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein put it last year in their book, “It’s Even Worse Than It Looks,” the G.O.P. has become “an insurgent outlier — ideologically extreme; contemptuous of the inherited social and economic policy regime; scornful of compromise; unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.”
But there’s one more important piece of the story. Conservative leaders are indeed ideologically extreme, but they’re also deeply incompetent. So much so, in fact, that the Dunning-Kruger effect — the truly incompetent can’t even recognize their own incompetence — reigns supreme.
To see what I’m talking about, consider the report in Sunday’s Times about the origins of the current crisis. Early this year, it turns out, some of the usual suspects — the Koch brothers, the political arm of the Heritage Foundation and others — plotted strategy in the wake of Republican electoral defeat. Did they talk about rethinking ideas that voters had soundly rejected? No, they talked extortion, insisting that the threat of a shutdown would induce President Obama to abandon health reform."

","Note: This story is from 2018.
A spokesman for United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement has resigned, saying that he could no longer “bear the burden” of spreading falsehoods on behalf of the Trump administration.
The spokesman, James Schwab, who had worked for the agency’s San Francisco Division, told news outlets Monday that his decision was prompted by false statements made by the agency on Feb. 27 and repeated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions last week.
[James Schwab gave a television interview three months after quitting. Federal investigators also showed up.]
The statements criticized the mayor of Oakland, Libby Schaaf, for her decision last month to warn city residents that a raid by federal immigration agents targeting roughly 1,000 people was imminent. The agency’s deputy director, Thomas D. Homan, said that Ms. Schaaf’s warning had helped “864 criminal aliens and public safety threats” to evade capture in the raid."

","Another report has come out in support of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), an innovative way to provide public transit at a low cost with dedicated bus lanes, stops, and schedules.
The study (PDF), from pro-transit group Embarq, found that BRT drastically reduced commute times, improved air quality, and cut road fatalities in congested cities like Bogota, Istanbul, Johannesburg, and Mexico City. And we already know that BRT is one of the most cost-effective public transit investments a municipality can make.
The catch? In most cities examined in the report, those benefits only extend to low- and middle-class residents. (In Johannesburg, the poorest residents did not use BRT).
""Since the dominant benefit is travel time savings,"" the study's authors wrote, ""the majority of benefits tend to accrue to the strata most represented by BRT users -- typically lower- and middle-income.""
While it's great to have a system that improves transportation access for the majority of a city's population, BRT's mass appeal could -- ironically -- be a political concern that prevents its adoption, at least in the U.S. As Alex Pareene wrote in Salon, public transit often suffers because politicians and donors rarely rely on it. The results show in the states, whose existing BRT systems lag behind those in cities around the world.
Even in densely populated and traditionally liberal cities like New York and Minneapolis, politicians neglect transit. And ""because they don’t know or interact with or receive checks from people who rely on it every day, there’s almost no hope for cheap, efficient mass transit options anywhere,"" Pareene wrote.
Indeed, the Embarq report echoes the public transit wealth gap, and cites that most BRT systems are often paid for by tax revenue collected from those who may never ride it. Bogota's famed TransMilenio was financed by increased gasoline taxes, and all the systems required both substantial investment and support from municipalities.
But the Embarq report also showed that BRTs benefited cities with environmental and productivity gains more than they strained financial resources. For example, the average commuter in Istanbul now gets to and from work about an hour faster thanks to the Metrobüs, and Mexico City's BRT system reduced air pollution enough to save 6,000 sick days a year.
As cities continue to grow and congestion increases, the benefits of BRT may become impossible to ignore -- even to the rich and powerful folks who are stuck in traffic."

","WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Exit polls conducted across the country on Election Day indicate a nation suffering from severe memory loss, those who conducted the polls confirmed Tuesday night.
According to the polls, Americans who cast their votes today had a difficult time remembering events that occurred as recently as six years ago, while many seemed to be solid only on things that have happened in the past ten days.
While experts were unable to explain the epidemic of memory loss that appears to have gripped the nation, interviews with Americans after they cast their votes suggest that their near total obliviousness to anything that happened as recently as October may have influenced their decisions.
“I really think it’s time for a change,” said Carol Foyler, a memory-loss sufferer who cast her vote this morning in Iowa City. “I just feel in my gut that if these people were in charge they’d do a really amazing job with the economy.”
Harland Dorrinson, who voted in Akron, Ohio, and who has no memory of anything that happened before 2013, said his main concern was a terrorist attack on American soil.
“I really think we need to put a party in charge that won’t ever let something like that happen,” he said.
In Texas, exit polls showed strong support for George P. Bush, who was running for the Republican nomination for Texas land commissioner. “George Bush sounds like the name of someone who would be really good at running things,” said one voter.
The national exit polls revealed an electorate deeply fearful of a number of threats, including ISIS, Ebola, and, oh, what was that other thing?

","Dr. Moore’s case has generated outrage and renewed calls to grapple with biased medical treatment of Black patients. Voluminous research suggests that Black patients often receive treatment inferior to their white counterparts, particularly when it comes to relieving pain.
“It’s had a huge impact,” said Dr. Christina Council, a primary care physician in Maryland who is Black, of Dr. Moore’s experience. “Sometimes when we think about medical bias it seems so far removed. We can sit there and say, ‘OK, it can happen to someone that may be poorer.’ But when you actually see it happen to a colleague and you’re seeing her in the hospital bed and literally pleading for her life, it just hits a different way and really hits home and says, ‘Wow, we need to do something.’”
A spokesman for Indiana University Health, the hospital system where Dr. Moore complained of poor treatment, said in a statement that he could not comment on specific cases because of privacy laws.
“As an organization committed to equity and reducing racial disparities in health care, we take accusations of discrimination very seriously and investigate every allegation,” the statement said. It added that “we stand by the commitment and expertise of our caregivers and the quality of care delivered to our patients every day.”
An intricate mix of socioeconomic and health factors have made Covid-19 particularly devastating for Black and Latino communities. Black people have died at 3.6 times the rate of white people, and Latinos at 2.5 times the rate of white people, according to an analysis by the Brookings Institution.
Dr. Moore tested positive for the coronavirus on Nov. 29 and was admitted to the hospital, according to her Facebook post, which she wrote on Dec. 4. She wrote that she had to beg the physician treating her to give her remdesivir, an antiviral drug some doctors use to treat Covid-19.
Dr. Moore said she received a scan of her neck and lungs after her doctor denied she was short of breath, despite her telling him she was, and after he told her he could not justify giving her more narcotic painkillers. The scan detected problems — pulmonary infiltrates and new lymphadenopathy, she said — and so she began receiving more opioid pain medication. But she said she was left in pain for hours before a nurse gave her the dose."

","WASHINGTON ― In the wake of the Republican failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act on Friday, leading figures in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party are rallying behind a single-payer health insurance and a raft of other bold reforms.
These lawmakers and grassroots leaders have long believed that the problems plaguing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, are rooted in the original health care law’s attempt to accommodate, rather than gradually replace, the private, for-profit health insurance system.
Now that efforts to eliminate the law wholesale are effectively dead, they are again arguing that the best way to improve the country’s health care system is to confront the power of corporate health care providers more directly.
“We have got to have the guts to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies and move forward toward a ‘Medicare for all,’ single-payer program,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said on MSNBC’s “All In with Chris Hayes” on Friday night. “And I’ll be introducing legislation shortly to do that.”
Sanders added on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that he would “absolutely” seek President Donald Trump’s cooperation on expanding Medicare and lowering prescription drug prices.
Even before the Republicans withdrew their Obamacare repeal bill, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), the deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee and a close Sanders ally, previewed this message at a rally in defense of Obamacare on Thursday.
“Don’t just be satisfied with defeating Trumpcare ― set your sights on creating real Medicare for all!” he told a cheering crowd of hundreds of activists. Ellison is a co-sponsor of a “Medicare for all” bill in the House.
Representatives of several major progressive organizations ― the Working Families Party, the Progressive Campaign Change Committee, Credo, Social Security Works and the National Nurses United ― all echoed this push in conversations with The Huffington Post on Friday and Saturday.
“The problem is the insurance companies, Big Pharma ― they’re gonna come back and use the chaos to their advantage,” predicted Social Security Works executive director Alex Lawson. “If Democrats go with a half-a-loaf policy, Republicans are going to blame them for the failures of Big Pharma. They have to immediately pivot to expanding Medicare.”
During the debate over repeal, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) used some of his time during a Budget Committee hearing to note that if Trump wanted to follow through on his campaign promise to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something “terrific,” he could fall back on an idea Trump himself endorsed in a 2000 book: single-payer.
On Monday, Khanna said that now is the moment to drive the single-payer message home. “To resist Trump, we need to play offense and not just defense,” he told HuffPost.
“As I pointed out in the Budget Committee hearing on Trumpcare a few weeks ago, Donald Trump supported a single payer system modeled after Canada in 2000 in his book [The America We Deserve],” Khanna went on. “He knows that is the only system that would fulfill his promise of more benefits, more coverage, and less costs. We should have every Democrat quoting Trump on a single-payer system as a mantra, and support Senator Sanders and Congressman Welch in their vision for Medicare for All, or at least, a public option. Senator Sanders is the leader of the Democratic Party currently in offering a conviction-based, affirmative vision. We should follow his direction.”
Notwithstanding the support of the influential groups for the proposal and ― according to a May 2016 Gallup poll ― even a majority of the American people, Medicare-for-all legislation is a non-starter in the current Congress. Single-payer health insurance still lacks support from many, if not most, Democrats, let alone from the Republican lawmakers who control both chambers.
But the proactive strategy speaks to increasing confidence among progressives that if they stick to their ideals and build a grassroots movement around them, they will ultimately move the political spectrum in their direction.
“It does take time for social change,” said Chuck Idelson, communications director of National Nurses United, a 150,000-person labor union that has long advocated for a single-payer health insurance system.
NNU is partnering with Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress on an online petition campaign demanding that Democrats back Medicare for all. The union is also advocating for a state level single-payer plan that is making its way through the California legislature.
“We didn’t end slavery overnight,” Idelson said. “It took from Seneca Falls in 1848 ’til 1920 until women won the right to vote. But they only won it by building a movement.”
The Washington Post reported Sunday that activists around the country urged their representatives over the weekend to get behind a single-payer program."

","At a glittering 2008 gala hosted by Gucci to benefit Madonna’s charity, Donald Trump bid more than $100,000 for a trip to Paris, earning him press from New York to London. But most of the money he used wasn’t his. It came from his foundation, to which he had donated just $30,000 that year.
The bid fits a pattern: Trump takes credit for splashy charitable acts to which he in fact gives relatively small sums. Over the years, Trump has made grandiose claims of giving millions in charitable donations while giving little to his own foundation. For example, in 2001, he claimed his Comedy Central roast raised $1 million for charity. But Trump’s foundation records show just one donation from Comedy Central for $400,000.
With Trump’s winning bid on the vacation, most of the money almost certainly did not come from Trump himself. Tax records from his foundation show that in the preceding years, the foundation had spent virtually all of its money each year. Then, in 2008 — the year Trump won the vacation — he donated $30,000 to his foundation. (The year before, Trump also donated just $30,000.) The largest donor in 2008 was the Willard T.C. Johnson Foundation, which gave $250,000 to the Trump Foundation.
Trump’s winning auction bid raises another question: What became of the vacation? The trip reportedly included a tour of the famed Chataeu Latour vineyard and a meal with actor Salma Hayek and her husband, the French billionaire François-Henri Pinault, whose family owns the vineyard.
Trump himself didn't go on the trip, an aide told BuzzFeed News, but said that she did not know what became of the auction prize. Asked if it had been given to someone else, she reiterated that she didn't know.
Tax experts contacted by BuzzFeed News said that even if Trump gave the trip to a family member or friend, Trump would have had to report the trip on his foundation’s IRS tax forms. Those forms, however do not report any such transactions. IRS rules require nonprofits to report any “self-dealing” — using their money to furnish their executives with money or other benefits. The Trump Foundation tax forms, called 990s, do not report any such transactions for that year."

","The U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that has effectively legalized same-sex marriage in all 50 states.
The court issued a 5-4 ruling Friday on Obergefell v. Hodges that struck down state bans marriage equality.
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen G. Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Anthony Kennedy ruled with the majority, while Chief Justice John Roberts was joined in dissent by Justices Antonin Scalia, Samuel A. Alito, Jr., and Clarence Thomas.
The court heard two and a half hours of arguments April 28 in the case, which consolidated cases legal challenges from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee.
""The petitioners, far from seeking to devalue marriage, seek it for themselves because of their respect — and need — for its privileges and responsibilities, as illustrated by the petitioners’ own experience,"" the majority found.
Scalia and Roberts slam liberal majority in same-sex marriage ruling: ‘Just who do we think we are?’
‘Ugh sodomites rejoice’: Furious bigots mutter and grunt over same-sex marriage ruling
The case hinged on whether states where same-sex marriage is banned should be required to recognize same-sex unions conducted legally in other states.
""The Fourteenth Amendment requires a State to license a marriage between two people of the same sex and to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-State,"" the majority found.
A string of federal court rulings in the 2013 United States v. Windsor ruling – which struck down a federal ban on same-sex marriage as unconstitutional – had already struck down bans in a number of states.
""No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family,"" Kennedy wrote for the majority. ""In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of
the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right."""

","How The Pentagon Plans To Spend That Extra $61 Billion
Enlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP
Congress was in a generous mood when it passed a spending bill last week, giving the military at minimum an additional $61 billion and boosting its overall budget to $700 billion this year.
For some perspective, that $61 billion increase matches or even surpasses Russia's entire military budget each year. It's more than the Trump administration originally requested. It rivals two big spending surges during President George W. Bush's administration, in 2003 and 2008, which went to fund the Iraq War.
""Today, we receive the largest military budget in history, reversing many years of decline and unpredictable funding,"" Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Friday as he appeared with President Trump. ""Now it's our responsibility in the military to spend every dollar wisely.""
Todd Harrison, who tracks military spending at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, notes that the military has just six months to spend this extra money before the fiscal year ends in September.
So can the military do it?
""There's one thing the Department of Defense is good at — it's spending money quickly,"" said Harrison. ""I am fully confident they'll be able to spend the money before it expires.""
To help, Congress is letting the military spend a bigger chunk in the final two months of the fiscal year than is normally allowed (25 percent rather than the usual 20 percent).
The Pentagon and its many supporters in Congress say this money is badly needed because budget constraints imposed under a 2011 budget deal have steadily eroded military readiness.

""The first job of the federal government is to defend the country,"" said Rep. Mac Thornberry, the Texas Republican who heads the House Armed Services Committee. ""We're doing that on about 15 percent of the federal budget. But we have cut too much in the last eight years and we have to make up for some of that ground that's been lost.
""As big as this year's defense budget looks, it's not enough to fix the problems. But it is enough to start to turn the corner to fix the problems,"" he added.
The additional money will help the Navy buy 14 new ships. The Air Force is getting 90 of its most advanced fighter jets, the F-35. The Army will receive dozens of new helicopters.
Across the military, troops will get a 2.4 percent pay hike, compared with 1.9 percent for civilian employees of the federal government.
There's also an army of critics who say military spending is too high. But regardless of where one stands on this question, there's a broad consensus that the herky-jerky budget process in recent years makes it very difficult for the military to plan.
""If I were the comptroller, I would want a full year, I would want a normal process, I would want less budget uncertainty,"" said Bob Hale, who was the comptroller of the Defense Department from 2009 to 2014.
""By far, the biggest thing that was a thorn in my side was the budget instability, and I don't see it ending,"" added Hale, who is now at the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton and is an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.
The budget deal does give the military another increase next year, up to $716 billion. Thornberry believes this will remove some uncertainty and establish a new spending baseline.
""The way the Pentagon and many of us in Congress are looking at this is, we've got some catch-up to do these two years,"" he said.
This big hike in military spending has broad support from both Republicans and Democrats, who also approved more for nonmilitary spending as well.
Trump threatened to veto the bill, but he reluctantly signed it Friday to avert a government shutdown.
Harrison, the budget analyst, says new weapons and health care costs keep rising rapidly. To maintain current levels, he says, the Pentagon needs to spend about 3 percent above inflation every year.
""We're going to have to make a decision as a nation about our overall defense strategy and the role of our military,"" he said. ""If you want to maintain the same level of involvement in the world, then you're going to need to fund a larger military.""
This debate looms as forecasters warn of a federal budget that could start churning out annual deficits of $1 trillion in the near future.

","Democrat Elizabeth Warren is proposing the elimination of existing student loan debt for millions of Americans, part of a sweeping set of education funding proposals announced as she and other presidential candidates seek to differentiate themselves in a sprawling field.
The Massachusetts senator says the proposal unveiled Monday would eliminate almost all student loan debt for 42 million Americans, canceling $50,000 in debt for each person with household income under $100,000. According to Warren's description of the plan in a piece posted on Medium, the debt cancellation proposal would create a one-time cost to the federal government of $640 billion.
Many in the growing field of Democratic candidates have proposed reforming the nation's student loan programs, including dramatic restructuring of existing refinancing structures, but Warren appears to be the first to propose flat-out debt cancellation. Warren and others in the field, including Sens. Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris, are backing the Debt-Free College Act, a bill that would cover all costs for students attending a public college without necessitating loans.
Among Warren's other proposals is elimination of tuition and fees for two- and four-year public college degree programs, as well as a $100 billion investment in Pell Grants, a federal aid program that requires no payback.
Tuition-free higher education was a mainstay of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential run. Warren, Harris and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, another presidential contender, all signed on as co-sponsors of Sanders' 2017 College for All Act, which would have allocated $47 billion annually to states to cover two-thirds of the tuition obligation, leaving states responsible for the rest.
The costs of debt cancellation and universal free college, Warren said, would be ""more than covered by my Ultra-Millionaire Tax — a 2 percent annual tax on the 75,000 families with $50 million or more in wealth.""
Warren's plan would also create a fund with a ""minimum of $50 billion"" intended to keep per-student spending at historically black colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions comparable to other area colleges.
Warren announced the policy ahead of a CNN town hall in New Hampshire focusing on issues important to young voters. Her slot in the five-hour broadcast Monday comes along with other appearances by Harris, Sanders and Sen. Amy Klobuchar as well as Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana.
Following New Hampshire, Warren this week is making stops in South Carolina, Texas, Iowa and Nevada."

","Speaker Nancy Pelosi argues that Democrats must stick together on procedural votes, which is the traditional view of party leaders on both sides of the aisle. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Congress ‘This is not a day at the beach’: Pelosi tells moderate Dems to stop voting with GOP House Democrats are divided over how to respond to Republican procedural attacks.
House Democrats held an emotional debate behind closed doors Thursday over how to stop losing embarrassing procedural battles with Republicans — a clash that exposed the divide between moderates and progressives.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) took a hard line at the caucus meeting, saying that being a member of Congress sometimes requires taking tough votes.
“This is not a day at the beach. This is the Congress of the United States,” Pelosi said, according to two sources.
Pelosi also said vulnerable Democrats who had the “courage” to vote against the Republican motions to recommit would become a higher priority for the party leadership and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the superstar New York freshman lawmaker, suggested she would alert progressive activists when Democrats are voting with the GOP on these motions, said the sources.
In the end, Pelosi and other top Democrats didn’t agree to any rules change and will continue to study the issue. The motion to recommit offers the House minority one last shot at changing legislation before it receives a final floor vote. Typically, the motion is used to try to squeeze the majority party, but it rarely succeeds.

Democratic leaders have vowed to do a better job preparing for the Republican motions, but the controversy has divided Pelosi and her longtime lieutenants, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina.
Pelosi argues that Democrats must stick together on procedural votes, which is the traditional view of party leaders on both sides of the aisle. Hoyer and Clyburn, however, have suggested that moderate members can vote with Republicans if they think it will improve their political standing.
Republicans have already won two motions to recommit this Congress, including a Wednesday vote that angered Ocasio-Cortez and other progressives. In contrast, Republicans stuck together and never lost a single such motion when they controlled the House from 2011 to 2019.
The latest defeat came on Wednesday, as the House debated legislation requiring background checks on all gun sales — a position overwhelmingly favored by Democrats. When Republicans moved to amend the bill to require Immigration and Customs Enforcement be told of any undocumented immigrant who tries to buy a gun, 26 Democrats voted with the GOP. The language was added to the gun bill, spoiling an important Democratic legislative achievement.
An earlier GOP motion condemning anti-Semitism was successfully attached to a House resolution barring U.S. involvement in the Yemeni civil war. That maneuver, which was backed by every Democrat, later caused parliamentary problems in the Senate and upended Democratic attempts to challenge President Donald Trump's foreign policy.
During the closed-door meeting on Thursday, Pelosi said Democrats who vote for the Republicans’ motions are putting pressure on other vulnerable colleagues who would prefer to stick with the party.
“We are either a team or we’re not, and we have to make that decision,” she said.
Pelosi told reporters afterward that she thinks Democrats should simply vote against the GOP motions, saying to do so otherwise gives Republicans “leverage.” But Pelosi didn’t endorse the idea, which some lawmakers support, of changing House rules and nixing the procedural vote altogether some lawmakers support.
“I’m a big believer in respecting the whole House and the rights of the minority to have their say,” Pelosi said during her weekly news conference. “I think we should just vote against all motions to recommit. It’s a procedural vote, it’s a ‘gotcha’ on the part of the opposition.”
Inside the meeting, Ocasio-Cortez said she has “a text chain with 200 activists in her district” that she’s in constant contact with on issues facing Democrats.
Ocasio-Cortez said she even considered voting against the background checks bill because of the Republican language on ICE, perhaps the most-hated federal agency on the left. Ocasio-Cortez went up to the gallery after the vote to tell activists she “had to choose between immigrants and gun violence. Not because of Republicans, but because of Democrats,” said a source in the room.
“I think it is an extension of Trump’s tactics into the House, and we cannot legitimatize it and we cannot allow for it and we cannot support it,” Ocasio-Cortez told reporters after the meeting.
But other members stood up in the meeting and challenged this view, without specifically calling out Pelosi or Ocasio-Cortez.
Freshman Rep. Xochitl Torres Small (D-N.M.), who voted for the GOP motion on Wednesday, grew visibly emotional when speaking and pointedly said courage looks different to different people, according to two sources in the room.
Some lawmakers and aides exited the meeting frustrated with Ocasio-Cortez’s remarks, with one member saying the freshman’s comments sounded like a passive-aggressive threat to Democrats who vote for the GOP motions.
A senior Democratic aide aligned with the caucus’ moderate wing said it was completely hypocritical for progressives to complain about the tough vote they had to take Wednesday.
“Moderates are in tough positions all the time, and they don’t shy away from that,” the aide said. “They have to vote their districts or they will be defeated, plain and simple. The rest of the caucus should [understand] that.”
Democrats aren’t sure how to handle the issue going forward.
Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) is part of a growing contingent who want to get rid of the motion to recommit completely, telling a reporter, “I think this motion to recommit is the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen.” Vargas spoke in favor of nixing the procedural tool during Thursday’s meeting.
“I’ve had my mole for 57 years, it’s right there on my arm,” Vargas told POLITICO after, pointing to his elbow. “And it does no good, either. It just sits there, one day maybe becoming cancerous. … It’s the same thing with the MTR. There’s no good reason for it.”
But other members disagreed, with Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) telling his colleagues it would “show weakness” to get rid of the motion to recommit entirely, though he’s not opposed to making changes. McGovern later told reporters that party leaders would continue to review the issue in the coming weeks.
“I think that the Republicans — like the Democrats when we were in the minority — used the motion to recommit as a ‘gotcha’ tactic. And I personally, think we shouldn’t fall for it,” McGovern said. “People need to be aware that coming down the road will be ‘gotcha’ amendments that actually gut the bill.”
The heated meeting — which several lawmakers and aides described as “confrontational” and “emotional” — is just the latest in a behind-the-scenes debate that has been simmering for weeks. The dispute has divided Democratic leaders and led to sniping among lawmakers and aides about who is to blame.
One senior Democratic aide said the fault lies with Hoyer and Clyburn, who need to do a better job of communicating to members, particularly the freshmen, about how they should vote. Another senior aide countered that Democrats wouldn’t have lost so many seats in 2010, when Republicans took back the majority, if “Pelosi hadn’t been so cavalier about members’ votes.”
“That should be a lesson for us now,” the second aide added.
There was one victory for Democratic leaders amid all the drama Thursday — they easily defeated a Republican effort to amend legislation that extends the deadline for federal background checks for gun purchases.
“I oppose this motion with every bit of my heart and soul and urge my colleagues to do the same,” Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) said, urging her colleagues to oppose the GOP motion in a passionate speech that left her shaking at the end of her comments.
In the end, only two Democrats — Reps. Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey — voted with Republicans, and the GOP motion failed."

","“We decided to dig deep and pay for television ads we weren’t planning to buy because we wanted to make the point that Fox News is out of the mainstream,” the movie’s director, Marshall Curry, told The Post, adding that he believed the network’s rejection of the ad was politically motivated. “It says something that some news channels trust their audience to interpret American history while Fox distrusts its audience and doesn’t think it can do that.”
AD
AD
A spokesman for NBCUniversal said the company had initially rejected the ad for MSNBC because an NBCUniversal standards group deemed the content too provocative. But the group then gave the filmmakers notes on potential changes that would make the ad acceptable for its airwaves, in particular saying the ad would need context before diving into the Nazi footage. The filmmakers responded by adding a title card explaining the footage was part of an Oscar-nominated film. The ad was then accepted.
“We wanted to make sure viewers had full understanding and appropriate context of this ad. And the filmmakers were open to feedback to make a change,” the spokesman, Joe Benarroch, told The Post.
A CNN spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
AD
Asked about the new developments, a Fox News spokeswoman re-sent a statement from earlier in the week by president of ad sales Marianne Gambelli which said the “ad in question is full of disgraceful Nazi imagery regardless of the film’s message and did not meet our guidelines.”
AD
Curry’s film is a vérité look at the New York rally held by the Bund, an American Nazi party, which drew 20,000 supporters to Madison Square Garden on Feb. 20, 1939, almost exactly 80 years ago. According to its filmmakers, it is intended as a warning about demagoguery in the current political climate under President Trump. The ad is meant to spread the word about the movie and increase digital viewership ahead of the Oscars later this month.
Curry said filmmakers had paid Charter Communication’s Spectrum in Los Angeles to run an ad during “Hannity” on Monday specifically to reach Trump supporters and awaken them to similarities with the man they support. Fox News quickly sought to distance itself from that spot at the time, telling The Post, “We have no control over what airs locally.” (The ad was bumped because of breaking news and was scheduled to air Thursday.)
AD
Curry and producer Field of Vision, through the marketing firm Cinetic, then sought to buy national ad time for the spot directly from Fox News. They were rejected.
AD
Anna Barnes, an executive at Cinetic, said the decision to buy national ad time happened as online views for the ad began coming in Monday. She said that the ad had garnered a larger audience than anticipated, and it resulted in a bigger budget to fund the national Fox play. When that was rejected, the group took the ad to other news networks. The Oscar campaign is being financed by Field of Vision, which is owned by First Look Media, the company co-founded by journalist Glenn Greenwald.
Filmmakers initially wanted the ad to air during “Hannity” because they believed it would have more impact with Trump supporters than with viewers of other networks. “The point of the spot is less about rallying people who are already worried [about demagoguery] than reaching people who don’t realize how dangerous this tactic is,” Curry said Monday. But he said Friday that he believes a broad audience also brought benefits.
AD
“Maddow” trails “Hannity” in total viewers, but the gap has not been large during the Trump era; in 2018, the shows averaged 2.9 million and 3.3 million viewers, respectively. “The Situation Room” lags further behind.
AD
The controversy over the “Garden” ad touches on debates about Trump’s presidency and the most effective way to discuss its policies. Curry said he hoped Fox News and those who supported the network would watch the spot and embrace it."

","The petition didn’t make much of an impact. Fifteen years ago today, the invasion of Iraq began.
Three months later, I returned to Iraq for the first time since 1991 as part of a collective to film a documentary about Iraqis in a post-Saddam Iraq. We wanted to show my countrymen as three-dimensional beings, beyond the binary of Saddam versus the United States. In American media, Iraqis had been reduced to either victims of Saddam who longed for occupation or supporters and defenders of dictatorship who opposed the war. We wanted Iraqis to speak for themselves. For two weeks, we drove around Baghdad and spoke to many of its residents. Some were still hopeful, despite being drained by years of sanctions and dictatorship. But many were furious and worried about what was to come. The signs were already there: the typical arrogance and violence of a colonial occupying power.
My short visit only confirmed my conviction and fear that the invasion would spell disaster for Iraqis. Removing Saddam was just a byproduct of another objective: dismantling the Iraqi state and its institutions. That state was replaced with a dysfunctional and corrupt semi-state. We were still filming in Baghdad when L. Paul Bremer III, the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, announced the formation of the so-called Governing Council in July 2003. The names of its members were each followed by their sect and ethnicity. Many of the Iraqis we spoke to on that day were upset with institutionalization of an ethno-sectarian quota system. Ethnic and sectarian tensions already existed, but their translation into political currency was toxic. Those unsavory characters on the governing council, most of whom were allies of the United States from the preceding decade, went on to loot the country, making it one of the most corrupt in the world.
We were fortunate to have been able to shoot our film in that brief period during which there was relative public security. Shortly after our visit, Iraq descended into violence; suicide bombings became the norm. The invasion made my country a magnet for terrorists (“We’ll fight them there so we don’t have to fight them here,” President George W. Bush had said), and Iraq later descended into a sectarian civil war that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians and displaced hundreds of thousands more, irrevocably changing the country’s demography.
The next time I returned to Baghdad was in 2013. The American tanks were gone, but the effects of the occupation were everywhere. I had low expectations, but I was still disheartened by the ugliness of the city where I had grown up and horrified by how dysfunctional, difficult and dangerous daily life had become for the great majority of Iraqis.
My last visit was in April 2017. I flew from New York, where I now live, to Kuwait, where I was giving a lecture. An Iraqi friend and I crossed the border by land. I was going to the city of Basra, in the south of Iraq. Basra was the only major Iraqi city I had not visited before. I was going to sign my books at the Friday book market of al-Farahidi Street, a weekly gathering for bibliophiles modeled after the famous Mutanabbi Street book market in Baghdad. I was driven around by friends. I didn’t expect the beautiful Basra I’d seen on 1970s postcards. That city had long disappeared. But the Basra I saw was so exhausted and polluted. The city had suffered a great deal during the Iran-Iraq war, and its decline accelerated after 2003. Basra was pale, dilapidated and chaotic thanks to the rampant corruption. Its rivers are polluted and ebbing. Nonetheless, I made a pilgrimage to the famous statue of Iraq’s greatest poet, Badr Shakir al-Sayyab."

","The past several days have been tumultuous for the Trump White House, and administration sources are now leaking information about the mood of panic that's emanating from the West Wing.
Sources tell Axios's Mike Allen that the White House at the moment is in a state of ""borderline chaos"" and that ""some staff is in survival mode"" and is ""scared to death"" by what's about to happen.
A ""West Wing confidant,"" meanwhile, tells Allen that it looks like ""nobody is in charge"" at the White House at the moment, and that the scandal surrounding fired National Security Adviser Michael Flynn shows the Trump administration is either ""reckless"" or simply has ""total incompetence.""
The trouble for the White House this week began when Flynn resigned after it was revealed that he lied about discussing American sanctions with the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during a phone call this past December.
Then on Tuesday evening, both the New York Times and CNN reported that senior Trump campaign officials were in constant contact with Russian intelligence officers during the 2016 presidential race.

","But in the massive demonstration against Whitmer’s stay-at-home executive order — which they have argued is excessive and beyond her authority — the pleas from organizers that protesters to stay in their vehicles went unheeded. Many got out of their cars and crashed the front lawn of the capitol building, with some chanting, “Lock her up!” and “We will not comply!”
“Do you think [Whitmer] is listening?” Breitbart News reporter Kyle Olson asked one of the organizers, Meshawn Maddock, a leader of the Michigan Conservative Coalition, on Facebook Live.

“Oh my God, how could she not be listening to this?” Maddock responded, adding, “There’s no reason why right now today she couldn’t come out and say, ‘Michigan, I hear you, and it’s time to get workers back to working.’ ”
The governor had heard plenty. She responded to the demonstration during her Wednesday news conference, saying she was “disappointed” in the mostly mask-less protesters outside and those in cars who affected bus service and even blocked an ambulance (which the organizers denied).
Whitmer said the protesters might have just made the situation worse in a state already dealing with more than 28,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the third-worst in the nation. The protest, called “Operation Gridlock,” “endangered people’s lives,"" she said.
AD
“We know that this demonstration is going to come at a cost to people’s health,” Whitmer said. “We know that when people gather that way without masks … that’s how covid-19 spreads. And so the sad irony here is that the protest was that they don’t like being in this stay-at-home order, and they may have just created a need to lengthen it, which is something we’re trying to avoid at all costs.”

Coming on the heels of similar protests in Ohio and North Carolina, it was probably the largest showing to date of conservative pushback against social distancing restrictions — and perhaps a preview of what’s to come.
AD
The Michigan Conservative Coalition and Michigan Freedom Fund — founded by Greg McNeilly, political adviser to the family of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos — planned the protest following Whitmer’s executive order last Thursday that expanded existing restrictions. Becoming one of the stricter stay-at-home measures in the country, Whitmer’s order intended to minimize unnecessary travel as much as possible. But some conservatives, including state lawmakers, argued it went too far and was inconsistent.
AD
Confused shoppers found they could buy liquor and lottery tickets on a trip to the grocery store, but couldn’t visit the vegetable seed aisle or gardening center. The order required large stores to shut down plant nurseries and rope off sections where carpet, flooring and paint were sold, provisions that conservatives found both arbitrary and harmful to business owners.
The response in Michigan was aggressive. Residents started a Facebook group called “Michiganders Against Excessive Quarantine,” and some filed a lawsuit. A letter to Whitmer from six Republican members of Congress from Michigan said Whitmer was “needlessly shutting down large sectors of the economy and further restricting the lives of residents.”
AD
Right-wing media joined in the chorus. Tucker Carlson of Fox News described Whitmer’s actions as “petty authoritarianism,” accusing her of putting on a show in an effort to be former vice president Joe Biden’s running mate. On Wednesday, Rush Limbaugh, a conservative talk-show host and Trump favorite, applauded the protesters, saying Democrats like Whitmer are “being coached by Nancy Pelosi and [Charles E.] Schumer to push this harder than they might normally feel is appropriate.”

Local law enforcement on Wednesday even joined the conservative criticism, as four county sheriffs wrote an open letter informing residents they would not be “strictly” enforcing Whitmer’s new order.
“While we understand her desire to protect the public, we question some restrictions that she has imposed as overstepping her executive authority,” the sheriffs of Leelanau, Benzie, Manistee and Mason counties wrote, while still encouraging people to follow social distancing rules. “She has created a vague framework of emergency laws that only confuse Michigan citizens.”

The political pressure Whitmer has faced to ease restrictions is starting to play out nationwide, especially as governors start coordinating plans for a safe reopening of the economy.
AD
As The Washington Post reported earlier this week, conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation and American Legislative Exchange Council are urging GOP lawmakers and the White House to push back against public health experts in a bid to reopen the economy as quickly as possible.
“A lot of Republicans and conservatives feel there might be an overreaction to all of this,” tea party organizer Richard Viguerie told The Post’s Jeff Stein and Robert Costa. “We’re all anxious to get back. Conservatives feel the government has overreacted, and it’s got to end.”
Elsewhere, protests similar to the one in Michigan played out in North Carolina and Ohio, as conservative protesters swarmed the capitol grounds to urge Govs. Roy Cooper (D) and Mike DeWine (R), respectively, to ease restrictions and reopen the economy. In Ohio, some in MAGA gear pressed themselves up against the windows of the Capitol building, photos in the Columbus Dispatch show.

Maddock, the leader of the Michigan Conservative Coalition who also campaigns for Trump, told Fox News she hoped Whitmer would see every car that attended Wednesday’s protest as representing a family out of job, struggling to pay bills and the mortgage.
Asked by a reporter what she might say to those families, Whitmer said she had thought of them while signing the stay-at-home order, knowing it would hurt businesses and families. But, she said, “I also know it is absolutely necessary with the path that we are on,” cautioning that carelessly rushing to lift restrictions too soon would leave the state’s economy worse off in the long run."

","Justice Ginsburg: 'I Am Very Much Alive'
Enlarge this image toggle caption Shuran Huang / NPR Shuran Huang / NPR
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in an interview Tuesday that she does not favor proposals put forth by some Democratic presidential candidates who have advocated changing the number of Supreme Court justices if the Democrats win the presidency.
Ginsburg, who got herself in trouble criticizing candidate Donald Trump in 2016, this time was critical not of any particular Democratic contender, but of their proposals to offset President Trump's two conservative appointments to the court.
The work is really what saved me.
""Nine seems to be a good number. It's been that way for a long time,"" she said, adding, ""I think it was a bad idea when President Franklin Roosevelt tried to pack the court.""
Several Democratic candidates have indicated an openness, if they were to win the presidency, to adding to the number of justices on the Supreme Court to reduce the power of the current conservative majority. Some would also like to enact term limits for Supreme Court justices.
The term-limits proposal doesn't worry Ginsburg because she sees it as unrealistic, given that the Constitution specifies life terms for federal judges and because, as she puts it, ""Our Constitution is powerfully hard to amend.""
Don't see the video? Click here.
Indeed, it takes the votes of two-thirds of the Senate and the House, and three-quarters of the state legislatures.
But, in contrast, as Ginsburg notes, there is no fixed number of justices specified by the Constitution, and the court over the course of history has had as few as five justices and as many as 10.
Roosevelt's proposal would have given him six additional Supreme Court appointments, expanding the court to 15 members. And Ginsburg sees any similar plan as very damaging to the court and the country.
""If anything would make the court look partisan,"" she said, ""it would be that — one side saying, 'When we're in power, we're going to enlarge the number of judges, so we would have more people who would vote the way we want them to.' ""
That impairs the idea of an independent judiciary, she said.
""We are blessed in the way no other judiciary in the world is,"" she noted. ""We have life tenure. The only way to get rid of a federal judge is by impeachment. Congress can't retaliate by reducing our salary, so the safeguards for judicial independence in this country, I think, are as great or greater than anyplace else in the world.""
But the whole notion of the country's independent judiciary hinges on public trust, she noted.
""The court has no troops at its command,"" Ginsburg pointed out, ""doesn't have the power of the purse, and yet time and again, when the courts say something, people accept it.""
She recalled Bush v. Gore, the controversial case in which the Supreme Court stopped a Florida recount in the 2000 presidential election.
""I dissented from that decision,"" Ginsburg said. ""I thought it was unwise. A lot of people disagreed with it. And yet the day after the court rendered its decision, there were no riots in the streets. People adjusted to it. And life went on.""
Ginsburg's interview with NPR was wide-ranging, discussing, among other things, her health. She has had three major bouts with cancer over the past 20 years. In 1999, she underwent surgery for colorectal cancer, followed by nine months of chemotherapy and radiation. In 2009, she underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer, and late last year, for lung cancer.
Outlasting the naysayers
Ginsburg's iconic status with women, in particular, and her leadership of the liberal wing of the Supreme Court mean any health news involving the tiny, 86-year-old justice can cause something of a panic in certain quarters.
Ginsburg is not oblivious to health concerns, but she waves away worries about her future.
""There was a senator, I think it was after my pancreatic cancer, who announced with great glee that I was going to be dead within six months,"" she recalled. ""That senator, whose name I have forgotten, is now himself dead, and I,"" she added with a smile, ""am very much alive.""
Don't see the video? Click here.
That said, most cancer patients do worry. Some view one cancer, never mind three, as a sword of Damocles over their heads. So how does Ginsburg manage? She said she has followed the advice of the opera singer Marilyn Horne, who was asked about her pancreatic cancer diagnosis in 2005.
""And she said, 'I will live,' not that 'I hope I live,' or 'I want to live,' but 'I will live.' ""
But fighting cancer is wearing and hard. How does she manage her work?
""The work is really what saved me,"" she said, ""because I had to concentrate on reading the briefs, doing a draft of an opinion, and I knew it had to get done. So I had to get past whatever my aches and pains were just to do the job.""
Missing Marty
Her lung cancer last year, however, was the first time she did not have her beloved husband, Marty, with her. He died in 2010, and she said she misses him every day, maybe especially now.
Her children have visited frequently to lift her spirits, but her husband, she said, always was there before, taking care of her, sleeping next to her on some uncomfortable cot or couch in the hospital, despite his bad back.
He looked after her so completely that at one point, when she was getting a blood transfusion, he ripped out the IV because he noticed that one of the antigens did not match.
""I might not have lived if he hadn't been there,"" she said.
And then there were the more subtle ways that he buoyed her spirits and goaded her to do the physical therapy that she needed to get stronger again. Famous for his culinary skills, he would make meals for her. He would entertain her, reading her short stories, and he served as her news clipping service, she said.
He would find the articles in the newspaper that would interest and amuse her. With a wistful smile, she said, ""I miss him every morning.""
She added, ""I have no one to go through the papers and pick out what I should read.""
The late-Justice Stevens to Ginsburg: ""Stay longer"" than he did
The interview followed Ginsburg's speech earlier in the day at the private funeral for Justice John Paul Stevens, who died July 16 at the age of 99.
Just days before, Ginsburg had been with him at a conference in Portugal.
Stevens retired from the court in 2010 at age 90, and, as the two traveled in a car together less than two weeks ago, Ginsburg told him her dream.
Law Former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens Lies In Repose Former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens Lies In Repose Listen · 3:27 3:27
""I said that my dream is that I will stay at the court as long as he did,"" she said. ""And his immediate response was, 'Stay longer!' ""
Rebutting the partisan label for the Supreme Court
Like other members of the current Supreme Court, liberal and conservative alike, Ginsburg rebuts the notion that the court is a partisan institution.
Yes, it is definitely more conservative than she would like, and, yes, she has strong disagreements with some of her colleagues on some issues. But overall, she maintains that the justices are working well together.
She notes with a grin that President Trump's two appointees to the court — Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh — were law clerks in her early years as a justice. And she points out that this term she assigned each of them important opinions to write in cases where she was the senior justice in the majority and the chief justice was in dissent.
No ""going back to old ways""
Interestingly, when the justice was asked to name her greatest accomplishments, she cited not her work on the court, but her work as a lawyer in the 1960s and '70s, leading the legal fight for gender equality in the law.
Asked whether she worries that the current conservative court majority will retrench on questions of gender equality, she replied, ""I don't think there's going to be any going back to old ways.""
Don't see the video? Click here.
And she noted that the late Justice Byron White, who was one of the two dissenters in Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that made abortion legal in the United States, voted on her side in all the gender parity cases.
""The world has changed really in what women are doing,"" she said, and there's no going back.
Does she have any regrets?
Regrets? she asked, in amazement.
""I do think I was born under a very bright star,"" she said. ""I get out of law schools with top grades; no law firm in the city of New York will hire me; I end up with a teaching job and time to devote to evening out the rights of women and men.""
And on and on, Ginsburg thinks she has led a very lucky life.

","The midterm elections showed that college-educated voters are fleeing the Republican Party and casting ballots for Democratic candidates, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Democrats had gained control of 33 formerly Republican house seats as of Friday, with other races too close to call.
Twenty-eight of the 33 flipped seats ""are in the top half among all House districts for educational attainment, meaning more than 30% of adults there have bachelor's or more-advanced degrees,"" the Journal reported.
The Democratic Party now controls 90 percent of the 30 House districts with the highest proportions of college-educated people. Going into the midterm elections, Democrats only held two-thirds of these seats.
Democrats have accumulated control over the most educated 30 districts over the last quarter century. Republicans and Democrats evenly split these seats when Bill Clinton took office.
Even in 2016, Republicans still maintained control of 10 of these seats.
Midterm voting revealed some other notable demographic shifts. Democratic support from college-educated white women increased eight percent from 2016, according to The Washington Post, which cited Cooperative Congressional Election Study data and a voter model to estimate patterns for the 2018 contests.
While, overall, college-educated voters selected Democratic voters, white college-educated voters did so by a smaller margin.
Fifty-nine percent of college-educated voters across the country selected a Democratic House candidate, according to Pew Research, which cited exit polls from Edison Research for the National Election Pool.
Fifty-three percent of white college-educated voters selected Democratic House candidates.
College-educated men leaned Republican, with 51 percent voting for the GOP, compared with 47 percent voting for Democrats in House races.
Midterm exit polls exhibited other strong divides. ""Whites overall continue to favor Republicans and minorities—especially blacks—continue to favor Democrats,"" the Brookings Institute reported. ""The 2018 exit polls show that minorities—including blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and other nonwhite groups—constituted an all-time high, 28 percent, of midterm voters, and fully 38 percent of young adult (age 18 to 29) voters.""
Vox noted that some fissures defining the outcome of the 2016 election have strengthened.
""Republicans did well with rural voters, white Southerner voters, and low-educated voters — while Democrats won among city-dwellers, minorities, and highly educated white suburbanites,"" the outlet said. ""The strength of these divides led to some consequential results, like Republicans' sweeping victory in the Missouri Senate elections or the Democratic 'biggest upset of the night' in an Oklahoma House race."""

","In an anonymous op-ed published at The Daily Caller, a self-proclaimed unpaid-but-high-ranking administration official writes that they see the government shutdown as an opportunity to drown government in a bathtub.
""As one of the senior officials working without a paycheck, a few words of advice for the president’s next move at shuttered government agencies: lock the doors, sell the furniture, and cut them down,"" Anonymous Unpaid Official (AUO) writes.
More specifically, AUO lays out the goal: ""The lapse in appropriations is more than a battle over a wall. It is an opportunity to strip wasteful government agencies for good.""
As you read further, it becomes pretty obvious that the writer of this op-ed is consumed with hatred for their fellow workers and indeed, for government itself. You can read some laced racism in, too, given how many people of color are employed by the federal government.
""Saboteurs peddling opinion as research, tasking their staff on pet projects or pitching wasteful grants to their friends,"" the writer states in a tone laced with bitterness and scorn. ""Most of my career colleagues actively work against the president’s agenda. This means I typically spend about 15 percent of my time on the president’s agenda and 85 percent of my time trying to stop sabotage, and we have no power to get rid of them. Until the shutdown.""
Oh, so another goal would appear to be to purge the government of anyone not in lockstep with Donald Trump and conservative agendas, then. I suppose Donald Trump fancies himself the Ronald Reagan of the 21st century, laying waste to government agencies to break them, the way Reagan did to the air traffic controllers.
There's a lot more in there, all bitter and angry, and it concludes with this:
The president’s instincts are right. Most Americans will not miss non-essential government functions. A referendum to end government plunder must happen. Wasteful government agencies are fighting for relevance but they will lose. Now is the time to deliver historic change by cutting them down forever.
It's almost like Grover Norquist wrote that, isn't it? I'm not sure which ""senior administration officials"" are going without pay, given that even Trump himself is still getting a paycheck, but apparently this person doesn't have to worry about losing the roof over their head, like Maria Sarto, an elderly resident of affordable housing, does.
It's great that The Daily Caller is pushing out an op-ed shoving Trump closer to the abyss, though. The longer this goes on, the more his approval ratings tank, even with his favorite pollster, Rasmussen.
It turns out most people don't want government drowned in a bathtub. Who could've guessed?

","Vice President Mike Pence next month will address Christians United for Israel, a group founded by megachurch Pastor John Hagee, who once said Hitler was a “hunter” sent by God to expedite the return of Jews to Israel.
According to Right Wing Watch, Pence has signed on to speak at Christians United’s annual gathering in Washington D.C., after Hagee supported the president and vice president throughout the 2016 presidential election.
Hagee made the remarks in a 1990s sermon uncovered during the 2008 presidential election—which prompted then-candidate John McCain to disavow the prominent evangelical.
“‘And they the hunters should hunt them,’ that will be the Jews,” Hagee said in that sermon, which he later apologized for. “ ‘From every mountain and from every hill and from out of the holes of the rocks’—If that doesn’t describe what Hitler did in the holocaust you can’t see that.”
“Theodore Herzl is the father of Zionism,” Hagee continued. “He was a Jew who at the turn of the 19th century said, this land is our land, God wants us to live there. So he went to the Jews of Europe and said ‘I want you to come and join me in the land of Israel.’ So few went that Hertzel went into depression.”
“Those who came founded Israel; those who did not went through the hell of the Holocaust,” he added. “Then god sent a hunter. A hunter is someone with a gun and he forces you. Hitler was a hunter.”
Pence’s boss, Donald Trump has pledged support for evangelical Christians. Last week, the president spoke at the Christian conservative nonprofit Faith and Freedom Coalition, arguing “It is time to put a stop to the attacks on religion.”
“We will end the discrimination against people of faith. Our government will once again celebrate and protect religious freedom,” he said, later adding he and his evangelical audience are “under siege.”"

","The first three years of the Trump administration have gone a lot better than I expected, and better in many ways than we had any right to expect. We aren’t engaged in any new military catastrophes, the economy held up, and the many, many bad policy choices he’s made are largely banal Republican Party policy choices rather than wild Trump-specific disasters.
But then there’s Hurricane Maria, which was our worst fears come to life.
Thousands of Americans died because the confluence of events in Puerto Rico posed a genuinely hard problem. It was a big storm. It hit an island that had significant preexisting economic weaknesses including problems with its electrical infrastructure. The overall political situation there was bad for reasons that predated Trump and had little to do with him. But the president’s job is to handle hard problems. And he couldn’t do it. Instead, he whined, he lied, he bragged, he shifted blame, and in the final analysis, the suffering was enormous.
The spectacle left us with two options for hope. One, maybe the whole thing was a consequence of Trump’s racist and self-interested instincts. Maybe a problem that impacted a larger, whiter, and less politically disempowered population would get a stronger response. (To be clear: This is a deeply dark option.) Two, maybe Trump’s luck would hold up and he’d just muddle through four or eight years without ever facing a really big crisis.
But his luck has run out.
Wednesday night’s catastrophic Oval Office address
On Wednesday night, Trump took the rare step of delivering a formal address to the public from the Oval Office. It turned out to be a catastrophe. If you’d asked me Wednesday morning, I would have said, “How bad could 10 minutes of reading a speech from a teleprompter possibly be?” The answer turns out to be worse than I’d thought.
The entire focus of the speech was wildly misguided, focused on ginning up xenophobia and restricting travel from abroad when the coronavirus is already spreading seemingly uncontrolled inside the United States.
But even within the narrow premise that delivering an Oval Office address about new restrictions on European travel was a good idea, Trump screwed it up beyond belief.
For starters, he misstated the policy, saying that he was banning all travel from Europe and eliding the fact that US citizens, US lawful permanent residents, and their families are exempted from the ban.
This does not apply to American citizens or legal permanent residents or their families. https://t.co/iZ2nrILhMg — Acting Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli (@HomelandKen) March 12, 2020
This is a huge deal on multiple levels. For starters, the United States is a big country, and to the extent that Americans travel internationally at all, they go to Europe pretty frequently. On any given day, the planes from Europe are about half-full of Americans coming home, so the incorrect announcement that they’d all be stranded on the wrong continent starting next week set off a panic. Americans rushed to airports, paid extortionate prices for last-minute flights, and, worst of all, created large crowds in enclosed spaces — exactly what we’re supposed to be avoiding during the coronavirus pandemic.

Somehow this wasn’t even the only thing Trump screwed up. He forgot to mention that Ireland is also exempt from the ban, and much of the post-speech cleanup from his staff also forgot to mention it in a way that would be clear to anyone other than the tiny minority of Americans who are familiar with the term “Schengen Area.” But suffice it to say that if you are an American currently in continental Europe and worried about finding a flight home, you may want to look into the possibility of connecting through Dublin, a non-Schengen city unaffected by Trump’s measures, that features frequent scheduled service to many American cities.
Then he also screwed up by saying on national television that he was canceling all trade in goods from Europe, only to have his staff come out later and explain that he was misspeaking. This was, to be clear, a prepared address coming from a teleprompter. But he seemingly couldn’t be bothered to speak clearly or explain his own policies in a way that would avoid panic or misunderstanding.
It looks like he misspoke... White House officials being forced to clarify that restrictions will only apply to humans... https://t.co/Z0dDm2GW9R — Shawn Donnan (@sdonnan) March 12, 2020
The speech was, in other words, far worse than simply doing nothing would have been. And this has been a hallmark of Trump’s public communications on the pandemic, which have been consistently misleading in a way that has induced confusion and failed at its goal of stemming anxiety.
When the only tool you have is a wall
The underlying policy that the Trump administration actually did put in place is not necessarily misguided. Restrictions on travel can contribute to flattening the curve, in much the way that other social distancing measures can help protect the most vulnerable populations.
But as my colleague Jen Kirby has written, experts are deeply skeptical that travel restrictions are a particularly high-value measure at this point. And even if Trump’s enthusiasm for them is not wrong per se, it’s clear that his obsession with the concept of an external threat has had catastrophic consequences for the United States. Due to his strong orientation in favor of travel bans, Trump was early in restricting travel from China — a measure that he said would prevent the virus from entering the United States. It obviously failed at that goal, but Trump insists at every opportunity on claiming and receiving credit for having been ahead of the coronavirus curve.
The problem is that while these measures probably were successful at helping the United States buy time, Trump didn’t do anything with the time.
The coronavirus testing situation has been a total shambles, despite the extra lead time.
And on the whole range of issues currently confronting the country — from economic stimulus to aiding people who are sick to advising state and local governments on what precautions to take to bolstering public health capacity — the administration did nothing at all throughout January and February.
It’s understandable that the president hoped the travel restrictions would work. But he knew perfectly well that he hadn’t shut off all travel to the United States (which would have been economically ruinous) and thus that it was possible border control would fail. Experts were nearly unanimous in their judgment that travel restrictions would not work, and Trump not only overruled their advice to put restrictions in place, he ignored their warnings and did nothing to create any kind of fallback plan. And since he’s stubborn and vainglorious, he continues to insist that the moral of this whole story is that the experts were wrong and he was right so we should bank on further travel restrictions to save us. It’s absurd.
A decentralized response isn’t good enough
The upbeat, optimistic thing to say these days is that civil society, corporate America, and state and local governments have been stepping up with responsible measures even in the absence of centralized leadership. It’s a nice thought, but honestly it doesn’t work. The issues involved feature a complicated balance of considerations and require some kind of coordination to really work.
The basic case for social distancing is that even small reductions in the virulence of an epidemic can lead to huge reductions in the ultimate death toll. So getting low-risk people to alter their behavior can have large payoffs for the lives of high-risk people. At the same time, social distancing measures can be costly in terms of their secondary economic impact. What we should have been doing is adopting the highest-value, lowest-cost distancing measures immediately, then identifying high-value, higher-cost measures and trying to quickly find ways to mitigate the costs so that they can be implemented swiftly.
Right now, for example, I know that officials in the District of Columbia are weighing the possible benefits of school closures with the reality that many low-income families rely on school-based free breakfast and lunch to meet their kids’ nutritional needs.
This is not really a dilemma that mayors and school chancellors can solve internally. It requires federal leadership to allow school systems to repurpose school lunch funds as financial support for families, and then to distribute new money to needy families, to local governments, and to food banks. There are dozens of similar situations in which we could use centralized leadership to identify dilemmas and then act quickly to resolve them so that public health steps can be taken at an acceptable cost.
Instead, the president is for some reason claiming that the Covid-19 testing process is going well and bragging about the stock market.

This is not going to end well.
Congressional Republicans have doomed us
One of the biggest myths of the Trump era is the notion that congressional Republicans have somehow rolled over for Trump or that he has bent them to his will.
In reality, on issue after issue, Trump bent to the views of Republican leaders. He has abandoned campaign promises to protect Medicaid, to invest in infrastructure, to make bank regulation stricter, to protect clean air and water, and to avoid tax cuts on the rich in favor of strict adherence to orthodox conservative public policy.
But the calculation Republicans have made is that as long as Trump staffs the bowels of the administrative state with Heritage Foundation guys and fills the judiciary with Federalist Society picks, they shouldn’t ask any tough questions about his honesty, corruption, temperament, basic fitness for office, or preferred management style. It was a calculation that until recently seemed to be paying off reasonably well from the standpoint of right-wing ideologues.
Trump allegedly inappropriately leveraged duly appropriated foreign aid money to pressure the Ukrainian government into launching a bogus investigation of Joe Biden’s family. But when it all came to light, the aid money to Kyiv flowed, Trump was shielded from accountability for his misconduct, and now Senate Republicans are set to do the bogus investigation themselves rather than make Ukraine do it for them. Business-friendly regulators are in place throughout the government, taxes on the rich have fallen, the social safety net is getting stingier, and conservatives are taking over the courts.
In exchange, the country lacks an experienced White House chief of staff to run the executive branch competently. The president’s wildly unqualified son-in-law is playing a key role in orchestrating the coronavirus response. His top economic adviser is a cable news celebrity with a demonstrated record of poor judgment. And the only real solution — a new leader at the top — is still months away from being possible."

","A Republican donor complained that black comedians can use racial slurs but he can't -- despite his repeated use of the N-word on social media and during interviews with reporters.
Steven Alembik, a GOP activist who donated $22,920 to the Ron DeSantis gubernatorial campaign and thousands more to other Republican candidates, called former President Barack Obama a “F*CK MUSLIM N*GGER” recently on Twitter, and used racial slurs when asked to explain the post, reported Politico.
DeSantis spokesman Stephen Lawson denounced the ""disgusting rhetoric"" of Alembik, who also helped the Florida lawmaker set up a speech at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.
The controversy is the fifth racism-related issue concerning DeSantis, who warned the day after he won the Aug. 28 primary that his black Democratic opponent, Andrew Gillum, would ""monkey this up"" if elected, referring to the economy.
Alembik, a self-employed information technology provider from Boca Raton, admitted using the racial slur in anger Sept. 8 after Obama gave a speech criticizing Trump and the Republican Party.
“Over the past few decades, the politics of division and resentment and paranoia has unfortunately found a home in the Republican Party,” Obama said, and Alembik saw a tweet by the Republican National Committee highlighting the remarks.
The 67-year-old Alembik said he was ""absolutely not"" a racist, but used several slurs to complain that white people were held to what he believes is a double standard.
“So somebody like Chris Rock can get up onstage and use the word and there’s no problem? But some white guy says it and he’s a racist? Really?” Alembik said. “I grew up in New York in the ‘50s. We were the kikes. They were the n*ggers. They were the goyim. And those were the spics.”
He said his social media activity should be held to a different standard than his behavior offline.
“When I write anything inflammatory, it’s because I’m seriously pissed off,"" Alembik said. ""I’m an emotional human being. Do I have a filter on what I say? In public, yes. Would I use that word in public? No. This is Twitter.”"

He used it five times during the interview.

State Rep. Anna Eskamani, an Orlando Democrat and former Planned Parenthood senior director, said: “With all due respect Mr. Speaker, my body is not a ‘host’ and personal medical decisions around my pregnancy belong to me, my family, my doctor, and my faith — not to politicians.”
Oliva in a statement following the outrage said he intended to use the phrase “host body” as a way to lower emotion but that clearly failed.
“In a recent interview where the very controversial topic of abortion was raised, I used the term ‘host’ to describe a pregnant woman. It was an attempt to use terminology found in medical ethics writings with the purpose of keeping the discussion dispassionate,” he said.
“The reaction undoubtedly shows it had the exact opposite effect. I apologize for having caused offense, my aim was the contrary.”
Oliva said he would support abortion legislation dictating a “cooling off period” to delay women—whom he described as the “host body”—from going through with the procedure.
It would also require that women be given “information” that could sway their final decision.
Critics said the notion simply confused medical facts entirely.
“Pregnant patients are autonomous people, not a ‘host body,’ “ said Dr. Daniel Grossman.
He also linked to a University of California, San Francisco study that found women don’t change their minds about getting abortions regardless if they wait three days."

","VICE News obtained data from all 50 states and Washington, D.C., on the number of physical polling locations they will have in place on November 3, and compared their numbers to how many sites they had in 2016 and 2012.
Almost 21,000 Election Day polling places have been eliminated heading into the 2020 U.S. election, a drastic dip in voting locations driven by a heavy shift to mail voting, coronavirus-related consolidations, cost-cutting measures, and voter suppression.
“Closing this many polling places at such a vast scale really does affect voters. Fewer polling places can lead to longer lines, longer wait times, and hurt people, particularly people who are disabled or don’t drive and rely on public transportation,” said Leigh Chapman, the voting rights program director at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.
The net result of all of these changes: A 20% dip in polling places across the country from 2016, and a 22% drop since 2012. And while the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated this trend, it didn’t create it: There were more than 3,000 fewer polling locations in 2016 than in 2012.
Of the 45 states that weren’t using mail voting exclusively before the 2020 election, 40 of them have decreased the number of Election Day voting locations from 2016. Of those 40 states who made cuts, 35 are not sending mail ballots to everyone, and 19 require many voters to take it upon themselves to apply for a mail ballot application. The five states that refused to allow mail voting for most people all cut voting sites, including the emerging swing state of Texas.
What emerged was a patchwork of cuts large and small across the country. Many states made these cuts as they were expanding mail voting — 23 states made it easier to vote by mail this year because of COVID. But the overall trend is clear: Most states are eliminating polling locations, a trend that could disproportionately impact poor, young and non-white voters.
But other states reduced Election Day polling sites without doing much else to make voting easier in spite of the coronavirus pandemic, like Texas and Georgia. Some of these cuts came for safety — removing polling stations from nursing homes, for instance — while others were made for budget reasons, or seemingly aimed at suppressing turnout.
A handful of states, including California and New Jersey, have drastically revamped how they conduct elections, pivoting heavily to mail voting and slashing polling places to reallocate resources to handle mail ballots. These states represent most of those who made the deepest cuts. Many, but not all, of these shifts have been in response to the coronavirus. In those states, it will be easier for many people to vote — but not everyone.
President Trump’s frontal assault on mail voting and attacks on the U.S. Post Office also have had a big impact. It’s led Republicans and some Democrats not to trust mail voting and pushing them toward in-person voting, both early and on Election Day. Republicans are voting by mail in much lower numbers than Democrats are, which could, ironically, create the kind of massive logjams in more GOP-leaning communities this year that traditionally have been more common in urban and suburban Democratic-leaning communities.
Recent polling shows that a majority of Americans plan to vote before Election Day, up from 41% who did in 2016 and 25% in 2012. Almost 40 million people had already voted early by mail or in person in the U.S. as of Oct. 21, with almost two weeks to go before Election Day — more than two-thirds of the 57.2 million votes cast before Election Day in 2016. If the pace keeps up, 2020 will smash early-voting records, taking the pressure off Election Day in many states because so many people will have already voted. Long early-voting lines in some locations in states like Texas and Georgia could end up taking the pressure off on Election Day, or they could be a sign of coming problems.
Every state has its own election rules and approaches — and even within states there can be huge disparities between counties. And the impact in a year where people are flocking to vote early by mail and in person in unprecedented numbers won’t be clear until Election Day.
Six states have eliminated at least half of their polling places for the 2020 election: California, Kentucky, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, and North Dakota.
Five states’ cuts make up three-quarters of the total number of polling places eliminated in the U.S. from 2016 to 2020. California alone accounts for almost half of national polling location cuts. Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, and Ohio combine to account for about a quarter of the cuts in terms of raw numbers of polling locations.
The pattern of polling-place closures is widespread: More than half of the 50 states have eliminated at least 10% of their voting sites from 2016 to 2020.
“Having polling locations farther away or that are more crowded creates a hardship for many workers, particularly blue-collar and hourly workers,” NAACP President Derrick Johnson told VICE News.
In the time of COVID, it’s not as safe to ride a bus across town to a new voting site as it would be to walk to the local school where voting used to occur. The people most likely to be impacted by this are disproportionately Black and Hispanic people, who statistically are less likely to have access to a car.
Shuttering polling sites can lead to voter confusion, as people head to the wrong place to vote out of habit or because they haven’t heard their old polling place has been closed or moved. It can also create undue logistical challenges, especially for people who don’t have their own cars, hourly workers who can’t afford to take time off to vote, and parents and others who can’t afford to wait in long lines at polling locations.
While the number and location of Election Day voting sites is just one of many measures of voter accessibility, it’s an often-overlooked factor compared to high-profile partisan fights like mail voting rules, whether and how long states will allow early in-person voting, and voter identification laws.
Most of the states that have made the deepest cuts in physical sites have also moved to dramatically expand mail voting, with many of them also shifting to vote centers, where anyone from a county can go and vote at any of the sites open in the area. But it’s unclear whether these improvements will make up for the cuts they’ve made to in-person voting.
This data set was gathered by reaching out — often multiple times — to every state’s board of elections or secretary of state’s office in the country. In cases where they wouldn’t or couldn’t provide the data, VICE News collected it county-by-county. These numbers were collected in late September through mid-October and may shift a bit by Election Day — some states hadn’t finalized their polling locations when contacted by VICE News, and Pennsylvania’s numbers are an initial estimate; the state didn’t plan on getting a final count until a week before the election.
“This level of doubt this late in the process is concerning. There are so many new variables on top of old problems. We’re talking about how voting will be carried out in the midst of a pandemic. We just don’t know [how it will work out].”
Johnson said even states that have expanded mail voting access while cutting Election Day polling sites are taking a gamble that could hurt some voters.
A recent in-depth study from professors at Harvard University and Boston University of Michigan voters found that while 66% of voters with access to a car voted in the 2018 general election, just 36% of voters without access to a car voted. The study also found that the further away the poll location was from a citizen’s home, the less likely they were to vote.
Mail voting can help alleviate some of this. But another big factor is simply how difficult it is to vote in person if you don’t own a car — a major reason why shuttering voting sites is a big problem, even in states that are rapidly expanding mail voting.
There are plenty of reasons it’s often harder for Black and Hispanic people to vote in person. Intentional voter suppression by white leaders is one driver. Another big factor: Black and Hispanic people are more likely to live in poor communities that underinvest in election resources, staff, and technology. Regardless of race, more densely populated communities tend to have longer voting lines — and Black and Hispanic people are more likely to live in urban areas.
Black and Hispanic voters have long faced steeper obstacles to vote than white voters — and not just in states with an obvious history of voter suppression. A recent study from the Brennan Center for Justice found that in the 2018 midterms, Latinos voting in person on Election Day waited in line almost 46% longer on average than white voters, and Black voters waited 45 percent longer. Fully 7% of all Black voters and 6.6% of Hispanics waited at least a half hour to vote, compared to just 4.1% of white voters. Year after year, some communities see voter lines stretch for multiple hours. This happened with regularity in the 2020 primaries and has already begun to happen during early voting this fall.
“Putting all your eggs in one basket seems like a very bad idea—and it’s avoidable. We’ve seen what happened in the primaries,” said Sylvia Albert, the national director of voting and elections at the good-government organization Common Cause.
Some states that made these pivots in past years saw huge Election Day lines as a result, as local officials underestimated in-person Election Day turnout. Nevada, for instance, had hours-long lines after switching to vote centers in 2018. And this year’s chaotic, COVID-impacted primary season showed that just pivoting to mail and shuttering most poll locations doesn’t work, with massive lines in states like Georgia that expanded mail voting access during their primaries while cutting polling places. Simply put, even the best-intentioned states that are cutting voting locations are trying something new and different, and it’s unclear how well it will work on Election Day.
A recent Pew Research survey found that 33% of people planned to vote on Election Day — the group that these poll closures could impact — while 39% of Americans planned to vote by mail in November, and 21% planned to vote early in person. Fully 56% of white voters who planned to back Joe Biden said they planned to vote by mail, or already had. But only 35% of all Black voters and 40% of all Hispanic voters planned to vote by mail.
And while expanding mail voting is a very positive development, polls show that Black and Hispanic voters have a lot less trust in mail voting than others—especially when Black and Hispanic Democrats are compared to white Democrats.
“If there are fewer polling place locations, the average distance for the average voter is going to be longer,” he said. “And [COVID] could exacerbate some of the effects we’re seeing—not only could it take a long time but they might feel unsafe getting there.”
Harvard professor Justin de Benedictis-Kessner, one of that paper’s coauthors, told VICE News that the voting site cuts found in our study would make it even harder for this group to vote. And he warned that those cuts in the middle of a global pandemic are even more problematic. People who normally might be willing to spend an hour on the bus to get to their voting site may not feel safe doing so this election.
That had a disproportionate impact on Black voters. While only 8% percent of white registered voters didn’t have access to transportation, more than a quarter of Black registered voters didn’t have a car in their household.
The most glaring example — and the one that alarms voting rights experts the most — is Maryland.
Some states have made deep cuts to Election Day voting sites but did little to nothing to making mail voting easier to access.
“You cannot fault voters for being hesitant about vote-by-mail. Obviously I think it’s a great option, but that’s what it is — an option. Voters should be able to choose whichever way they want to vote,” said Albert, Common Cause’s national director of voting and elections.
Even in states that have dramatically expanded mail voting, cuts to in-person Election Day voting sites could lead to disenfranchised voters — and could disproportionately impact poor and nonwhite voters as well as younger voters who are less likely to live at the same address they did in the last election.
“There has been a concerted effort to discredit vote by mail, a concerted effort to undermine and politicize the Post Office, and when you take historic usage rates, where people of color were less likely in most states to use vote by mail, and combine that with extra worry that the mail service was going to be unreliable, of course you’re going to have fewer people voting by mail,” said Myrna Pérez, the director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s voting rights and elections program.
While Trump voters have been dissuaded from mail voting by his false attacks on the integrity of mail voting, some Democrats have been dissuaded because of worries that their mail ballots won’t be counted—especially in light of U.S. Post Office slowdowns caused by the Trump-appointed postmaster general.
That’s not surprising given the long history of voter suppression against voters of color in the U.S. And to this day, Black voters’ mail ballots are rejected at higher rates than white voters’ because of errors on the ballots.
But experts fear this won’t be nearly enough to avoid catastrophe. Parts of Maryland have historically had hours-long voting lines on Election Day. Some voters were forced to wait in line until after midnight during this summer’s primary. This plan could well make things significantly worse.
Republican Gov. Larry Hogan blocked a proposal to send every registered voter a ballot, reversing himself after allowing ballots to be sent out to everyone during the primary. He did approve a plan to send an absentee ballot application to every voter, which could take off a bit of pressure from Election Day. The state has added some mail voting drop boxes as well, retained eight days of early voting, and many areas have switched to vote centers. The state is opening some big voting centers at Camden Yards, where the Baltimore Orioles play, and FedEx Field in Prince George’s County, where the Washington Football Team plays.
The state has moved to eliminate 80% of its polling places, the highest proportion in the country. That includes a 90% cut in heavily Black Baltimore — the city has gone from 296 polling places in 2016 to just 24 this election. There will be almost 19,000 potential voters for every polling place in the state — almost five times more people per polling place than the national average of 4,200.
Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams (R) made clear when the new plan was announced that early in-person and mail voting would need to take the pressure off Election Day polling locations.
That move came as part of a bipartisan deal in response to the coronavirus. Kentucky never allowed early voting for most people before this year. But for this election, Kentuckians have 18 days to vote early in person — every day except Sunday from Oct. 13 through Election Day. The state is also allowing people to vote by mail without an excuse this year.
“Considering the access problems that Native groups have already, closing polling locations in North Dakota is another way to limit access,” said Albert.
North Dakota is another state that’s made deep cuts without making it much easier to vote: It has eliminated almost 60% of its Election Day in-person voting locations. The state has long allowed mail voting. But voters still have to request a mail vote application, fill it out and send it back, then complete and return their actual ballot — a multi-step process that is onerous especially for new voters. Only about one-third of North Dakotans voted by mail in 2018. The state’s substantial Native American population has often faced obstacles to voting, and those who live on reservations often face slower mail and can sometimes lack traditional addresses, complicating how they can receive ballots.
Those include a number of states with a history of voter suppression. When the Supreme Court blew a hole in the Voting Rights Act in 2013, many of the states who previously had to abide by its more restrictive rules quickly moved to cut polling places. And the cuts had a disproportionate impact on Black and Hispanic voters.
Some states have made some major voting expansion moves while cutting polling places, and the net impact on voters won’t be clear until after the election. But others have simply cut polling places while doing little to expand voters’ access to the ballot box.
“If you put too much pressure on any one leg of that stool, then the stool snaps,” Adams said in August.
Texas added an extra week of early voting, but the cuts to Election Day polling places in some key counties have voting rights experts worried. And the cuts are much deeper in some counties than others, though part of that dip is because many counties have switched to vote centers. Counties that have switched to the vote-center model and cut polling places include Tarrant County, home to diverse Fort Worth, which is down 19%, and heavily Hispanic El Paso County, which is down by about 30%.
Texas cut 11% of its polling places on balance since 2012. The state is also one of just five not allowing all voters the option of voting by mail in the middle of the pandemic.
The state hasn’t cut as many polling places as some others, but it’s down 7% since 2016 and 12% since 2012. There have already been some huge lines in some places for in-person early voting.
That includes Georgia, which already had early in-person voting and voting by mail. The state made voting easier by sending ballot applications to every registered voter in the primary, but Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger reversed himself and refused to send out those applications for the general election .
Five states opted to send mail ballots to all registered voters this election for the first time: California, Nevada, Montana (in most counties), New Jersey, and Vermont, as well as Washington, D.C. Altogether, they’ve cut more than 12,000 polling sites.
Many of the states with the deepest cuts to Election Day voting places have made major efforts to expand other types of voting.
It’s unclear what will happen on Election Day in states like these that have made mail voting a bit easier but have also cut polling places. Polls indicate that many more people plan to vote by mail this election than in the past, and preliminary early-voting numbers show that’s definitely occurring in many states. But while that could benefit overall turnout, the Election Day polling site cuts could make it harder for people who prefer to vote in person.
Iowa, another swing state, has cut a quarter of its polling places. And while many counties have sent voters absentee ballot request forms, they still need to fill them out and return them to vote by mail. The state offers a month of early in-person voting.
Ohio still has enough locations that there are only 3,365 voting-age citizens per polling place, below the national average of 4,390 potential voters per polling place. The state has almost a month of early in-person voting, and for the first time it sent out mail ballot request forms to all registered voters.
Ohio has eliminated 860 polling places, the fifth highest number in the country, though that represents 20% of all its voting sites — a cut that’s similar to the national average.
Other states are making less dramatic but still substantial changes to their Election Day plans, and only time will tell whether they work out for voters.
The other states that aren’t allowing everyone to vote by mail this election are Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Indiana, which has largely switched to the vote center model, has cut 18% of Election Day voting sites from 2016 to 2020; Louisiana is down 4% from 2016 and 9% from 2012; Mississippi is down 10% from 2016 and 13% since 2012; and Tennessee is down 17% since 2016.
California’s cuts are absolutely massive: The state has eliminated more than 10,000 voting sites from its 2016 elections. But the state has also taken every effort to make it easier for people to vote. The Golden State has long had a robust mail voting program, and the coronavirus pandemic convinced state officials that they needed to do everything they could to encourage more people to vote by mail. They decided to send every registered voter a ballot in the mail — essentially making it a vote-by-mail state with additional options.
While California has cut almost three-quarters of its voting sites, leaving around 10,000 voting-age citizens per polling location on average, that’s because most of its large counties have opted to switch to vote centers, where anyone who lives in the county can vote at any of their polling locations, rather than have to go to their specific precinct. People can also register to vote as late as Election Day when they go to vote.
The state also has more than 1,200 drop boxes for voters who don’t trust the mail to return their ballots, offers a full month of early in-person voting for those who want to vote in person, and will count all ballots postmarked by Election Day even if they come in days later in the mail. The result has been a surge in early ballot returns much higher than in previous years — 1.5 million were returned within two weeks of being sent out, ten times the number at the same date in 2016 — which will likely take pressure off Election Day voting.
The new model was crafted with heavy input from voting rights and civil rights groups, local community leaders, and local officials, and could well boost voter access and turnout overall. But it does have some risks.
Common Cause California Executive Director Jonathan Mehta Stein, who helped negotiate the plan, told VICE News that he hoped the combination of expanded voting options would help tamp down voting lines on Election Day and before, “But we can’t be certain of that” until the election happens.
The state also has one of the highest rates in the country of people moving, given its sky-high real estate prices and a large proportion of renters to homeowners, a large homeless population, and wildfires that have displaced more than 200,000. Many people will have an easier time voting this election. But for those who’ve moved and haven’t updated their address, or those who don’t have a home address, the new plan could make it harder to vote — especially if they don’t have transportation to the polls.
“We’re concerned about voters who are displaced by the COVID pandemic and voters who are displaced because of the wildfires. There are a lots of people who’ve been pushed out of their homes in 2020,” said Stein.
Nevada and New Jersey, two other states that made deep cuts to Election Day polling sites, also sent ballots to all registered voters for the first time this year, as did most Montana counties. Nevada will also have vote centers and three weeks of extended early voting, as it has in the past, while Montana and New Jersey have essentially become mail-only states this election.
Arizona, a crucial swing state, has made a similar shift, and will have barely half the number of Election Day voting sites it had in 2012.
But the state has long allowed mail voting. Roughly 80% of Arizonans voted by mail the last two general elections, and 88% of Arizonans cast their ballots by mail during the state’s August primary.
Many Arizona counties have also switched to vote centers rather than precincts, so anyone in the county can vote at the most convenient sites. While the state doesn’t send every registered voter a ballot, it does send everyone an application, and many people have opted to become permanent early voters, where they get a ballot automatically sent to them. That could make it less consequential that they’re cutting almost 40% of their Election Day voting sites. But the state has a rapidly growing population, so new voters might not find it so convenient to use the system. And the state’s large Native American population faces unique challenges in voting by mail."

","Introduction
Three-fourths of survey respondents — including 66 percent of Republicans and 85 percent of Democrats — back a constitutional amendment outlawing Citizens United.
The study also indicates that most Americans — 88 percent overall — want to reduce the influence large campaign donors wield over lawmakers at a time when a single congressional election may cost tens of millions of dollars.
That most Republican and Democratic voters want to amend the Constitution to limit big money’s role in politics is notable because it’s the “most drastic step that can be taken,” said Steven Kull, director of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy’s Program for Public Consultation, which conducted the study.
The 2010 Citizens United decision specifically allowed corporations, unions and certain nonprofits to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to advocate for and against political candidates. It also gave rise to super PACs — lightly regulated political committees that have become major weapons in both state and federal politics.
Candidates and political parties, meanwhile, may by law only accept limited contributions.
Overturning Citizens United has been many liberals’ dream for years, although it’s highly unlikely to happen. The traditional route for amending the Constitution requires a vote of two-thirds of both the House and Senate, followed by ratification by three-fourths of state legislatures. The Constitution was last amended in 1992.
Most survey respondents also support congressional action on money in politics that fell short of a constitutional amendment, such as a bill that required corporations and unions to report campaign spending to shareholders, members and the public in addition to disclosures they file with the Federal Election Commission.
Some major corporations with household names indeed keep their political practices and spending quiet, such as Expedia, Garmin and Netflix, among others, according to a study by the nonpartisan Center for Political Accountability and the University of Pennsylvania.
A recent Center for Public Integrity analysis found that Congress has little appetite for passing laws addressing campaign cash: Of more than two dozen money in politics bills introduced early in the current congressional session, lawmakers have not conducted a single formal hearing or vote on any of them.
Less than half of those surveyed consider an anti-Citizens United amendment to be an attack on free speech. More than four out of five agree with the statement that “the rich should not have more influence just because they have more money.”
David Keating, president of the Institute for Free Speech, a conservative nonprofit, questioned the survey’s findings.
“If Americans knew that repealing Citizens United would allow Congress to censor critics and make it more difficult to defeat corrupt incumbents then they’d be less likely to support it going away,” Keating said. “It’s typical for academics to tout biased polls with questions that try to undermine support for free speech.
Although Democrats typically tout reducing big money and eliminating secret money in politics, they don’t always follow their own counsel.
For example, a Center for Public Integrity investigation revealed how a big-spending Democratic super PAC used a loophole in federal law to hide the identities of its donors until after Alabama’s special U.S. Senate election in December. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also benefited from millions of dollars worth of so-called “dark money.”
One campaign finance reform that most survey respondents dismissed? Funding presidential campaigns with public money using a federal system that’s largely fallen out of favor since the Citizens United decision. Two-thirds of respondents would prefer the federal government nix the checkbox on their tax forms that provides $3 to campaigns and instead direct the funds to other areas, such as pediatric research or deficit reduction.
Campaign finance reform isn’t the only thing voters on both sides of the aisle agree on: the University of Maryland found in a study late last year that Americans on the whole thought lawmakers should wait longer periods of time before cashing in on K Street as lobbyists."

","Photograph by John Locher / AP
NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)—Bernie Sanders failed to impress major media outlets over the weekend as he barely managed to win seventy per cent of the vote in three western primaries.
The major cable networks briefly mentioned Sanders's vote tallies in Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii but noted that he ran out of steam well shy of eighty per cent.
“There’s no point in sugarcoating it,” one analyst put it. “Rough night for Sanders.”
According to one cable executive, Sanders needs to “put up some big numbers fast” if he expects the networks to continue giving his campaign airtime.
“It’s going to be harder and harder to justify covering him while he’s stuck down in the seventy-per-cent range,” the executive said.
While Sanders campaign officials remain optimistic about the upcoming primary in Wisconsin, media outlets are calling it a “do or die” state after his sputtering finishes over the weekend.
“I think if he limps across the finish line with, say, seventy-five or seventy-nine per cent, it’s going to be time for him to reassess things,” one cable representative said. “That would have to be a wake-up call.”
A spokesperson for CNN could not be reached for comment, as the network was busy preparing a ninety-minute special on the birth of Donald Trump’s new grandchild."
progressive,"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/19/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-99-percent-new-income-going-to/
","When U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., finds a microphone these days, you can expect him to harp on the erosion of the American middle class.
Sanders, who has said he is considering a 2016 presidential run and caucuses with Democrats, made a striking point about the country’s income inequality over the last 40 years in an April 19 interview on Fox News Sunday.
""What we're seeing, Chris, right now is that for 40 years, the American middle class has been disappearing. Millions of people are working longer hours for lower wages despite a huge increase in technology and productivity,"" Sanders said. ""And what we have seen during that period is a massive transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent of America — massive wealth and income inequality, where you have 99 percent of all new income today going to the top 1 percent.""
With the financial rift between everyday and mega-rich Americans poised to dominate the 2016 White House race, PolitiFact wanted to examine Sanders’s statement about 99 percent of all new income going to the top 1 percent.
The research behind the claim
Sanders used a similar line about the top 1 percent taking home 99 percent of all new income during a Brookings Institution speech a couple months ago, saying, ""In fact, the latest information that we have shows that in recent years, over 99 percent of all new income generated in the economy has gone to the top 1 percent.""
The Washington Post Fact Checker awarded that claim One Pinocchio, a designation for claims that include in part a ""selective telling of the truth."" Sanders did not agree with the conclusion and doubled down on the accuracy of his claim in a displeased letter.
Sanders’ office told us the senator was talking about pre-tax income growth from 2009-13 during his Fox interview. A Sanders spokesman highlighted a New York Times Upshot article in January by Justin Wolfers , a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan.
Wolfers based his calculations on the work of University of California Berkeley economics professor Emmanuel Saez, who uses pre-tax income reported on Internal Revenue Service filings in his studies of top incomes, including capital gains. Saez and French economist Thomas Piketty have written about the disparate recovery from the recession among America’s two big income classes for several years. Saez found most recently that the top 1 percent captured 91 percent of all income gains from 2009-12.
Using Saez’s preliminary 2013 numbers, Wolfers stretched the window to account for an average of 2012-13 incomes (He used an average for those years because tax rates on top earners increased in 2013, prompting some to shift more income to 2012.).
The takeaway?
The average income for the richest 1 percent of Americans, excluding capital gains, rose from $871,100 in 2009 to $968,000 from 2012-13, he wrote. The 99 percent, on the other hand, experienced a drop in average incomes from $44,000 to $43,900, Wolfers said. The calculation excludes government benefits in the form of Social Security, welfare, tax credits, food stamps and so on.
""That is, so far all of the gains of the recovery have gone to the top 1 percent,"" Wolfers wrote for the New York Times post.
Sanders spokesman Jeff Frank said his office double-checked the statistic with Wolfers, who double-checked his own work with Saez.
Saez told PolitiFact that the key to understanding the statistic is knowing that it’s measuring pre-tax, pre-government benefit income.
""That's the key stat to think about how the market allocates incomes in the first place,"" Saez said. ""Anybody should be worried that the recovery from the Great Recession has been so skewed in terms of market incomes.""
Other points to consider
Other economists argue that the more comprehensive way to talk about income is by looking at earnings after taxes and how government alters the income picture. That measure is called net or disposable income.
Under this measure, the income differences are not as badly skewed, Saez said.
That’s because on one side, government programs are making life easier for low-income Americans through things such as Social Security, unemployment compensation, veterans’ benefits, food stamps, welfare, housing assistance, health subsidies, and the Earned Income Tax Credit, said Brookings Institution fellow Gary Burtless.
At the same time, tax policy has become more progressive since 2009 through lower taxes for middle- and lower-income Americans and higher taxes for higher earners.
The drawback with this analysis, however, is it does not reflect how people are ""sharing directly in the rewards of the market,"" said Urban Institute fellow Eugene Steuerle, who has written about the different definitions of income . For Steuerle, all of the numbers matter, though each one holds a different meaning depending on the policy question.
Steuerle is a fan of the Congressional Budget Office , the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, which he said offers a more comprehensive look at the income gap by including labor, business, capital and retirement income. Another way to think of it is comparing living standards.
In November 2014, CBO released a study of household income taxes, which compared income growth after taxes since 1977. The problem is it only goes up to 2011, so we cannot compare it to the 2009-13 market measure. Other researchers have probed inequality in income growth over other time periods (a couple detailed here ), but they do not apply to Sanders’s recovery timeframe.
""Is there a lot of inequality in living standards after tax and transfers? The right data to answer that question is simply unavailable for recent years,"" Wolfers said.
Often, income inequality measures do not account for health care, the costs of which are often employer-paid and can level the playing field between low- and middle-income earners and the super rich, Steuerle said.
Another point to keep in mind: The country’s top earners experienced the biggest percentage of income declines during the recession — a point that Sanders’s claim does not account for because it picks up with the recovery, Burtless said.
To Burtless, Sanders’s estimate is correct in the narrow way he meant it but would be overstated under a broader income definition that extends pre-2009.
Our ruling
Sanders said that ""99 percent of all new income (is) going to the top 1 percent.""
Sanders is referring to pre-tax, pre-transfer income growth during the economic recovery from 2009-13.
We found consensus among economists that the statistic and calculation offered by Sanders is credible, but it’s just not the only way to consider income inequality. Other measures may be equally valid and produce different results. But economists say specific data does not yet exist.
Sanders’ claim is accurate but needs additional notes of context. We rate it Mostly True."

","Cornel West is a professor at Union Theological Seminary and one of my favorite public intellectuals, a man who deals in penetrating analyses of current events, expressed in a pithy and highly quotable way.
I first met him nearly six years ago, while the financial crisis and the presidential election were both under way, and I was much impressed by what he had to say. I got back in touch with him last week, to see how he assesses the nation’s progress since then.
Advertisement:
The conversation ranged from Washington, D.C., to Ferguson, Missouri, and although the picture of the nation was sometimes bleak, our talk ended on a surprising note.
Last time we talked it was almost six years ago. It was a panel discussion The New Yorker magazine had set up, it was in the fall of 2008, so it was while the financial crisis was happening, while it was actually in progress. The economy was crumbling and everybody was panicking. I remember you speaking about the financial crisis in a way that I thought made sense. There was a lot of confusion at the time. People didn’t know where to turn or what was going on.
I also remember, and this is just me I’m talking about, being impressed by Barack Obama who was running for president at the time. I don’t know if you and I talked about him on that occasion. But at the time, I sometimes thought that he looked like he had what this country needed.
Advertisement:
So that’s my first question, it’s a lot of ground to cover but how do you feel things have worked out since then, both with the economy and with this president? That was a huge turning point, that moment in 2008, and my own feeling is that we didn’t turn.
No, the thing is he posed as a progressive and turned out to be counterfeit. We ended up with a Wall Street presidency, a drone presidency, a national security presidency. The torturers go free. The Wall Street executives go free. The war crimes in the Middle East, especially now in Gaza, the war criminals go free. And yet, you know, he acted as if he was both a progressive and as if he was concerned about the issues of serious injustice and inequality and it turned out that he’s just another neoliberal centrist with a smile and with a nice rhetorical flair. And that’s a very sad moment in the history of the nation because we are—we’re an empire in decline. Our culture is in increasing decay. Our school systems are in deep trouble. Our political system is dysfunctional. Our leaders are more and more bought off with legalized bribery and normalized corruption in Congress and too much of our civil life. You would think that we needed somebody—a Lincoln-like figure who could revive some democratic spirit and democratic possibility.
That’s exactly what everyone was saying at the time.
Advertisement:
That’s right. That’s true. It was like, “We finally got somebody who can help us turn the corner.” And he posed as if he was a kind of Lincoln.
Yeah. That’s what everyone was saying.
And we ended up with a brown-faced Clinton. Another opportunist. Another neoliberal opportunist. It’s like, “Oh, no, don’t tell me that!” I tell you this, because I got hit hard years ago, but everywhere I go now, it’s “Brother West, I see what you were saying. Brother West, you were right. Your language was harsh and it was difficult to take, but you turned out to be absolutely right.” And, of course with Ferguson, you get it reconfirmed even among the people within his own circle now, you see. It’s a sad thing. It’s like you’re looking for John Coltrane and you get Kenny G in brown skin.
Advertisement:
When you say you got hit hard, are you talking about the personal confrontation you had with him?
I’m just thinking about the vicious attacks of the Obama cheerleaders.
The personal confrontation you had with him is kind of famous. He got angry at you because you were saying he wasn’t progressive enough.
Advertisement:
I just looked at him like “C’mon, man. Let the facts speak for themselves. I’m not into this rhetorical exchange.”
Is there anybody who thinks he’s progressive enough today?
Nobody I know. Not even among the progressive liberals. Nobody I know. Part of this, as you can imagine, is that early on there was a strong private-public distinction. People would come to me and say privately, “We see what you’re saying. We think you’re too harsh in how you say it but we agree very much with what you’re saying in private.” In public, no comment. Now, more and more of it spills over in public.
Advertisement:
There’s a lot of disillusionment now. My liberal friends included. The phrase that I have heard from more than one person in the last year is they feel like they got played.
That’s true. That’s exactly right. What I hear is that, “He pimped us.” I heard that a zillion times. “He pimped us, brother West.” That’s another way of saying “we got played.”
You remember that enthusiasm in 2008. I’m from Kansas City. He came and spoke in Kansas City and 75,000 people came to see him.
Oh yeah. Well we know there were moments in Portland, Oregon, there were moments in Seattle. He had the country in the palm of his hand in terms of progressive possibilities.
Advertisement:
What on earth ails the man? Why can’t he fight the Republicans? Why does he need to seek a grand bargain?
I think Obama, his modus operandi going all the way back to when he was head of the [Harvard] Law Review, first editor of the Law Review and didn’t have a piece in the Law Review. He was chosen because he always occupied the middle ground. He doesn’t realize that a great leader, a statesperson, doesn’t just occupy middle ground. They occupy higher ground or the moral ground or even sometimes the holy ground. But the middle ground is not the place to go if you’re going to show courage and vision. And I think that’s his modus operandi. He always moves to the middle ground. It turned out that historically, this was not a moment for a middle-ground politician. We needed a high-ground statesperson and it’s clear now he’s not the one.
And so what did he do? Every time you’re headed toward middle ground what do you do? You go straight to the establishment and reassure them that you’re not too radical, and try to convince them that you are very much one of them so you end up with a John Brennan, architect of torture [as CIA Director]. Torturers go free but they’re real patriots so we can let them go free. The rule of law doesn’t mean anything.
The rule of law, oh my God. There’s one law for us and another law if you work on Wall Street.
Advertisement:
That’s exactly right. Even with [Attorney General] Eric Holder. Eric Holder won’t touch the Wall Street executives; they’re his friends. He might charge them some money. They want to celebrate. This money is just a tax write-off for these people. There’s no accountability. No answerability. No responsibility that these people have to take at all. The same is true with the Robert Rubin crowd. Obama comes in, he’s got all this populist rhetoric which is wonderful, progressive populist rhetoric which we needed badly. What does he do, goes straight to the Robert Rubin crowd and here comes Larry Summers, here comes Tim Geithner, we can go on and on and on, and he allows them to run things. You see it in the Suskind book, The Confidence Men. These guys are running things, and these are neoliberal, deregulating free marketeers—and poverty is not even an afterthought for them.
They’re the same ones who screwed it up before.
Absolutely.
That was the worst moment [when he brought in the Rubin protégés].
Advertisement:
We tried to point that out as soon as he became part of the Rubin stable, part of the Rubin group, and people didn’t want to hear it for the most part. They didn’t want to hear it.
Now it’s six years later and the search for the Grand Bargain has been fruitless. Why does he persist? I shouldn’t be asking you to psychologize him…
I think part of it is just temperament. That his success has been predicated on finding that middle ground. “We’re not black. We’re not white. We’re not rich. We’re not poor. There’s no classes in America. We are all Americans. We’re the American family.” He invoked the American family last week. It’s a lie, brother. You’ve got to be able to tell the truth to the American people. We’re not a family. We’re a people. We’re a nation. And a nation always has divisions. You have to be able to speak to those divisions in such a way that, like FDR, like Lincoln, you’re able to somehow pull out the best of who we are, given the divisions. You don’t try to act as if we have no divisions and we’re just an American family, with the poor getting treated in disgraceful ways and the rich walking off sipping tea, with no accountability at all, and your foreign policy is running amok with Israelis committing war crimes against precious Palestinians and you won’t say a mumbling word about the Palestinian children. What is history going to say about you? Counterfeit! That’s what they’ll say, counterfeit. Not the real thing.
Let’s talk about Ferguson. All I know about it is what I’ve been reading in the newspapers; I haven’t been out there. But I feel like there’s a lot more going on there than this one tragic killing.
Oh, absolutely. I mean, one, we know that this is a systemic thing. This thing has been going on—we can hardly get a word out of the administration in terms of the arbitrary police power. I’ll give you a good example: Carl Dix and I, three years ago, we went to jail over stop and frisk. We had a week-long trial and we were convicted, we were guilty. While the trial was going on, President Obama came into New York and said two things: He said that Michael Bloomberg was a terrific mayor even though he had stopped and frisked over four and a half million since 2002. Then he went onto say that Ed Koch was one of the greatest mayors in the last 50 years. This is right at a time when we’re dealing with stop and frisk, arbitrary police power, and Bloomberg is extending stop and frisk and proud of it. At least Bloomberg is honest about it. Bill De Blasio is just trying to walk a tightrope in this regard. At least Bloomberg was honest about it. He was glad that stop and frisk was in place. When we went to jail he said, “Y’all are wrong. If stop and frisk is stopped, then crime is going to go up…”
I just give you that as an example in terms of arbitrary police power because in Ferguson we’re talking about arbitrary police power, and this particular instance of it has been going on for a long time. The Obama administration has been silent. Completely silent. All of a sudden now, you get this uprising and what is the response? Well, as we know, you send out a statement on the death of brother Robin Williams before you sent out a statement on brother Michael Brown. The family asked for an autopsy at the Federal level, they hold back, so they [the family] have to go and get their own autopsy, and then the federal government finally responds. [Obama] sends Eric, Eric’s on the way out. Eric Holder’s going to be gone by December.
Oh, is he?
Yeah, he’s already said, this is it. He’s concerned about his legacy as if he’s somehow been swinging for black folk ever since he’s been in there. That’s a lie. He’s been silent, too. He’s been relatively silent. He’s made a couple of gestures in regards to the New Jim Crow and the prison-industrial complex, but that’s just lately, on his way out. He was there for six years and didn’t do nothing. See what I mean?
I see exactly what you mean, but I look at the pictures at Ferguson and it looks like it could be anywhere in America, you know.
Absolutely. It looks like it could be New York, Chicago, Atlanta, L.A. It’s like they’re lucky that it hasn’t hit New York, Chicago, L.A. yet, you know.
When they rolled out the militarized police, it frightened people. Something is going on here. It’s not breaking down the way it usually does. People are reacting to this in a different way.
That’s true. It’s a great moment, but let me tell you this though. Because what happens is you got Eric Holder going in trying to create the calm. But you also got Al Sharpton. And when you say the name Al Sharpton, the word integrity does not come to mind. So you got low-quality black leadership. Al Sharpton is who? He’s a cheerleader for Obama.
I haven’t followed him for years; I didn’t know that.
He meets with the president regularly.
I did not know that.
On his show on MSNBC…
I knew he had a show, I just…I guess I don’t watch it enough.
You gotta check that out, brother.
That’s the problem with me, I don’t watch enough TV.
It’s probably good for your soul but you still have to be informed about how decadent things are out here. But, no: MSNBC, state press, it’s all Obama propaganda, and Sharpton is the worst. Sharpton said explicitly, I will never say a critical word about the president under any condition. That’s why he can’t stand what I’m saying. He can’t stand what I do because, for him, it’s an act of racial traitorship to be critical of the president. There’s no prophetic integrity in his leadership.
I understand that. I think a lot of people feel that way. Not just in a racial sense but because Obama’s a Democrat. People feel that way in a partisan sense.
I think that’s true too. You have had some Democrats who’ve had some criticisms of the president. You’ve got some senator that has been critical about his violation of civil liberties and so forth, and rightly so. But Sharpton, and I mention Sharpton because Sharpton is the major black leader who is called on to deal with arbitrary police power. So, Trayvon Martin, what did he do? You got all this black rage down there calling for justice. Has there been justice for Trayvon Martin? Has the Department of Justice done anything for the Trayvon Martin case? None whatsoever. The same is true now with Ferguson. They call Sharpton down. He poses, he postures like he’s so radical. But he is a cheerleader for the Obama administration which means, he’s going to do what he can to filter that rage in neoliberal forms, rather than for truth and justice.
One last thing, where are we going from here? What comes next?
I think a post-Obama America is an America in post-traumatic depression. Because the levels of disillusionment are so deep. Thank God for the new wave of young and prophetic leadership, as with Rev. William Barber, Philip Agnew, and others. But look who’s around the presidential corner. Oh my God, here comes another neo-liberal opportunist par excellence. Hillary herself is coming around the corner. It’s much worse. And you say, “My God, we are an empire in decline.” A culture in decay with a political system that’s dysfunctional, youth who are yearning for something better but our system doesn’t provide them democratic venues, and so all we have are just voices in the wilderness and certain truth-tellers just trying to keep alive some memories of when we had some serious, serious movements and leaders.
One last thought, I was talking to a friend recently and we were saying, if things go the way they look like they’re going to go and Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee and then wins a second term, the next time there’ll be a chance for a liberal, progressive president is 2024.
It’d be about over then, brother. I think at that point—Hillary Clinton is an extension of Obama’s Wall Street presidency, drone presidency, national surveillance, national security presidency. She’d be more hawkish than he is, and yet she’s got that strange smile that somehow titillates liberals and neo-liberals and scares Republicans. But at that point it’s even too hard to contemplate.
I know, I always like to leave things on a pessimistic note. I’m sorry. It’s just my nature.
It’s not pessimistic, brother, because this is the blues. We are blues people. The blues aren’t pessimistic. We’re prisoners of hope but we tell the truth and the truth is dark. That’s different."
progressive,"https://www.rawstory.com/2018/08/trump-desperately-tries-save-face-pentagon-postpones-military-parade-cancelled/
","After the Pentagon on Thursday night announced it was postponing President Donald Trump's planned military parade, the president took to Twitter to try to save face.
In particular, Trump claimed that he made the decision to ""cancel"" the parade and he blamed Washington D.C. city officials for allegedly inflating the cost of the parade.
""The local politicians who run Washington, D.C. (poorly) know a windfall when they see it. When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade, they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it,"" the president wrote.
The president then said that he would ""attend the big parade already scheduled at Andrews Air Force Base on a different date, & go to the Paris parade, celebrating the end of the War, on November 11th.""
The president concluded by saying that he still wanted to hold the military parade at some date in the future.
""Maybe we will do something next year in D.C. when the cost comes WAY DOWN,"" he wrote. ""Now we can buy some more jet fighters!""
The Pentagon on Thursday announced that it was postponing the military parade after cost estimates for it shot up from $12 million to $92 million."
progressive,"http://www.ecowatch.com/abolish-epa-bill-pruitt-2267818117.html
","By Alex Kotch
Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz turned heads when he introduced a bill on Feb. 3 to ""completely abolish"" the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
""Today, the American people are drowning in rules and regulations promulgated by unelected bureaucrats,"" Gaetz told fellow GOP lawmakers in an email reported by the Huffington Post ""and the Environmental Protection Agency has become an extraordinary offender.""
Rep. Gaetz's bill came the day after a Senate committee voted in favor of confirming Scott Pruitt, the fossil fuel-friendly attorney general of Oklahoma who has sued the EPA 14 times, to head the agency.
And like Pruitt, Rep. Gaetz and his three fellow sponsors of H.R. 861 have all benefited from campaign donations from oil, gas and coal companies and large electric utilities.
The four GOP representatives have raked in campaign cash from some of the biggest corporations peddling fossil fuels, including Koch Industries, Duke Energy, Chevron and ExxonMobil. What's more, an independent political spending group funded by an oil and gas company stepped in with ad buys to aid in Gaetz's recent U.S. House race.
Over their careers, these legislators appear to have responded in kind, pushing legislation favored by the industries reliant on fossil fuels. Here's who they are, how much they've received from the industry and what they've been up to in recent years.
Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL)
Since 2010, Gaetz's political campaigns have received $28,000 directly from fossil fuel companies and energy utilities, according to data compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics. These donors include the corporate PACs of utilities including Duke Energy, Gulf Power, NextEra Energy, Progress Energy, Southern Company and Teco Energy; oil and gas companies Chevron, Exxon and Koch Industries; and individual donors including the CEO of Gulf Power and the CEO of Global Industries and Dore Energy.
In 2016, as Gaetz ran for his first term in Congress, a super PAC supporting him received a $100,000 donation from Harness Oil and Gas, a Texas-based company reportedly run by family friends. This super PAC, North Florida Neighbors, spent more than $460,000, the bulk of its total expenditures during that election cycle, supporting Gaetz.
As a Florida state legislator, Gaetz successfully fought the requirement that gas sold in the state contain a minimum percentage of ethanol, something he called ""a feel-good attempt to use alternative energy.""
Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)
Massie, a U.S. representative since 2012, was first elected with the backing of the Tea Party group FreedomWorks, which heavily opposes environmental regulations and regularly questions whether humans are affecting the climate.
In his three congressional campaigns, Massie took in nearly $155,000 from companies working in various parts of the oil, gas and coal industries, including Alpha Natural Resources, Chevron, Duke Energy, Exxon, Halliburton and Koch Industries, as well as from CSX Corporation, a transportation company that operates trains carrying coal, oil, natural gas and frac sand, an essential material used in shale drilling.
From his position in Congress, Massie has attacked and attempted to weaken the EPA repeatedly. He co-sponsored a 2016 bill to shift how the EPA analyzes greenhouse gas emissions in favor of fossil fuel companies—a bill lobbied for by Marathon Petroleum (which has given him $20,000) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (which raises doubt about human-caused climate change). Before that, he co-sponsored a 2015 resolution weakening an EPA rule under the Clean Air Act and a 2014 bill lowering EPA ambient air quality standards.
The Liberty for All Super PAC, funded mostly by the young, Texas-based millionaire investor John Ramsey, spent nearly $630,000 backing Massie for Congress in 2012. Unsurprisingly, Ramsey has ""oil and gas ventures,"" according to his biography on the super PAC's website.
Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-GA)
Loudermilk's state and federal campaigns have received more than $60,000 from fossil fuel companies and trade associations, including Duke Energy, Exxon, Georgia Mining Association, Georgia Power, Koch Industries and Valero Energy.
In Congress, Loudermilk has co-sponsored several energy-related bills: a nuclear energy bill for which Duke Energy and Southern Company lobbied; a repeal of the U.S. crude oil export ban, which numerous fossil fuel companies, including BP, Chevron, Exxon, Marathon Oil and ConocoPhillips, lobbied in support of; and a bill challenging EPA greenhouse gas regulations, another piece of legislation oil and gas companies and utilities favored.
Both Loudermilk and Massie sit on the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology—which has jurisdiction over the EPA, the Department of Energy and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)—and its subcommittee on oversight, key positions that would naturally attract the attention of fossil fuel companies.
Loudermilk's 2015 financial disclosure statement reveals that he received state funding to attend and speak at a ""conservative policy summit"" hosted by the climate change-denying Heritage Foundation, which has reportedly received $780,000 from ExxonMobil and nearly $6 million from Koch family foundations. Another speaker at the conference was Myron Ebell, the notorious climate change denier who led Trump's EPA transition team. Ebell crafted Trump's plan to hobble the EPA.
As a Georgia state senator, Loudermilk was on the communications and technology task force of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative bill mill that unites state legislators and big business representatives. ALEC has a history of producing templates for anti-environmental legislation involving climate change denial, promoting gas pipelines and attacking residential solar energy. In addition, ALEC is funded by many of the same fossil fuel corporations that donated to the campaigns of Loudermilk and his fellow legislators hoping to abolish the EPA: Chevron, CSX, Dominion, Duke Energy, Exxon and Koch Industries, to name a few.
Rep. Steven Palazzo (R-MS)
PACs and employees of companies in the energy and natural resources sector have given more than $265,000 to Palazzo's four federal election campaigns, which includes $168,000 from oil and gas companies. The fourth-largest donor is Mississippi Power, an electric utility owned by Southern Company that burns coal and natural gas and has given Palazzo's campaigns more than $34,000. Palazzo has also taken in $24,000 from Chevron, nearly $20,000 from Koch Industries and $19,000 from General Electric.
In 2015 Palazzo voted to oppose an EPA rule that increased emissions standards for coal-fired power plants and the year prior, he voted to halt defense spending on climate change initiatives and cut all funding for the Department of Energy's energy efficiency and renewable energy program. In previous years, Palazzo voted to speed up natural gas pipeline permits, allow state laws to supersede federal EPA laws regarding hydraulic fracturing (""fracking"") and cut funding to the EPA, among other measures.
While serving as Mississippi state representative, Palazzo was also a member of ALEC.
Rep. Gaetz's office declined to offer comment, while the other three representatives did not respond to requests for comment.
While their bill to kill the EPA has been receiving little support from either political party and is unlikely to pass, its mere existence marks the extent to which fossil fuel funding has the potential to influence elected officials. This bill joins an effort already underway among the GOP-controlled House, Senate and White House to roll back regulations to protect the environment and public health.
Congressional observers likely can expect to see more of the same from these four representatives in the future.

","According to a breaking news report from the Associated Press, the nation’s most senior official who oversees the $1.5 trillion loan market has resigned in protest over what he says is Trump’s hostile policies towards students in debt.
In his resignation letter, Seth Frotman says he stay at his position as student loan ombudsman until the end of the week.
From the AP:
Frotman is the latest high-level departure from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau since Mick Mulvaney, President Donald Trump’s budget director who has been also acting director of the bureau, took over in late November. But Frotman’s departure is specifically notable, since his office is one of the few parts of the U.S. government that specifically was tasked with handling student loan issues.
Addressing Mulvaney in his letter, Frotman accused the Trump administration of using the agency “to serve the wishes of the most powerful financial companies in America.”
“Unfortunately, under your leadership, the Bureau has abandoned the very consumers it is tasked by Congress with protecting,” Frotman wrote, addressing Mulvaney and the Trump administration.
Frotman has served in his position for the past three years. The position was created by Congress in 2010 in response to the financial crisis. As ombudsman and assistant director, Frotman oversaw the CFPB’s Office for Students and Young Consumers and fielded complaints from student borrowers about the practices of private lenders, loan servicers and debt collectors.
In a tweet this Monday morning, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) wrote that Frotman’s resignation is a result of the Trump administration forcing “another cop from the beat when it comes to protecting students from predatory #4profit colleges, loan servicers, and repayment scams.”
“It is shameful,” Durbin tweeted. “I thank Mr. Frotman for his hard work and years of service on behalf of students & taxpayers.”
The Trump Administration has forced another cop from the beat when it comes to protecting students from predatory #4profit colleges, loan servicers, and repayment scams. It is shameful. I thank Mr. Frotman for his hard work and years of service on behalf of students & taxpayers. https://t.co/5WcHloOJSW — Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin) August 27, 2018
Since 2011, the CFPB has reviewed more than 60,000 student loan complaints and returned more than $750 million to aggrieved borrowers, NPR reports. But the office underwent a change since Trump took over the presidency, and that change was reflected in Frotman’s letter.
“The Bureau’s current leadership folded to political pressure… and failed borrowers who depend on independent oversight to halt bad practices,” Frotman wrote.
From NPR:
The Trump administration has also taken steps outside the CFPB to curb oversight of the student loan industry. The Justice and Education departments have argued that debt collectors should be protected from state efforts to regulate them. And, earlier this month, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos moved to scrap a rule meant to punish schools where graduates struggle with poor earnings and deep debt. The department defended its decision, saying it would instead give borrowers school performance data so they can decide for themselves what colleges offer the best value.
Frotman also accused CFPB leadership of suppressing a report he prepared which revealed that some of the nation’s largest banks were “saddling [students] with legally dubious account fees.”

","The results are sharply more negative for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker than the most recent Marquette University poll of the governor’s race in June. | Scott Olson/Getty Images Poll shows Walker trailing Democrat by double-digits in Wisconsin
A new poll from NBC News and Marist College shows Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker trailing a Democratic challenger by double-digits, part of a raft of rough results for Republicans across three Midwestern states.
The poll showed Wisconsin state education superintendent Tony Evers, the Democratic primary front-runner, taking 54 percent to Walker's 41 percent in a head-to-head matchup. Walker has warned for months that Republicans need to be active and vigilant as he runs for a third term, with Democrats winning a series of down-ballot elections in Wisconsin earlier this year.
But Democrats have had to grapple with a crowded Democratic primary field that at one point included more than a dozen candidates, but which has shrunk to eight ahead of the Aug. 14 primary. Evers has consistently polled at the front of the Democratic field.
The results are sharply more negative for Walker than the most recent Marquette University poll of the governor’s race in June, which showed Walker narrowly ahead of Evers, 48 percent to 44 percent.
NBC and Marist also surveyed the governor's races in Michigan and Minnesota, with the results showing Democrats in commanding positions in both open races.
In Michigan, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer, the front-runner in her party's gubernatorial primary, led Republican primary front-runner Bill Schuette in a general election matchup, 47 percent to 38 percent.

In Minnesota, former Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty trails Democrats Lori Swanson and Tim Walz, the two top candidates in their primary. The poll shows both Democrats getting 51 percent support to Pawlenty's 40 percent.
Democrats also performed well on the Senate ballot in all three states polled. In Wisconsin, incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin held a substantial lead over both potential Republican challengers. She led businessman Kevin Nicholson by 15 percentage points among registered voters, and led state Sen. Leah Vukmir by 17 percentage points.
Nicholson and Vukmir were neck and neck in the Republican primary, according to the poll, which echoed recent findings from Marquette University and other polling outfits.
In the Michigan Senate race, incumbent Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow topped both potential Republicans challengers by double-digits. Stabenow led John James by 18 percentage points, and led Sandy Pensler by 15 percentage points.
And in the Minnesota race, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith — who replaced former Sen. Al Franken in January — led Republican Karin Housley 49 percent to 35 percent.
In Wisconsin, the poll surveyed 906 registered voters. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points for the general election. In Minnesota, the poll surveyed 876 voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. In Michigan, the poll surveyed 886 registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points."

","Sanders isn’t interested. His campaign said Thursday that he’s giving the money to a Washington health clinic instead — and the drug executive isn’t getting the meeting.
WASHINGTON — The man who has become the public face of rising drug prices says he has donated to presidential candidate Bernie Sanders — who has been bashing Big Pharma on the campaign trail — to try to get a meeting so the two can talk it out.
Martin Shkreli, chief executive officer of Turing Pharmaceuticals, became one of the Democrats’ favorite villains after raising the price of the only treatment of a rare parasitic infection by 4,000 percent. He’s an unlikely supporter of the Vermont senator, a self-described socialist who has proposed letting people import cheaper prescription drugs from Canada and requiring Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices.

In an interview with Stat on Thursday, however, Shkreli confirmed that he’d donated $2,700 to the Sanders campaign — the maximum individual contribution — on Sept. 28.
At the time, the campaign sent the Turing CEO a form e-mail full of populist fervor: “Our political system is corrupt. Big Money controls much of what happens. Together, you and I are changing that. Thank you again for your support. Best, Bernie.”
On Thursday, however, campaign spokesman Michael Briggs said Sanders won’t keep the money. Instead, the campaign will make a $2,700 donation to the Whitman-Walker health clinic in Washington. “We are not keeping the money from this poster boy for drug company greed,” Briggs said.
Shkreli made the contribution, he said, partly because he supports some of Sanders’ proposals — just not the ones about drug prices. But mainly, he said, he donated to get the senator’s attention in the hopes that he could get a private meeting to explain why drug companies set prices the way they do.

Shkreli is “furious” that Sanders is using him as a punching bag without giving him a chance to give his side.
“I think it’s cheap to use one person’s action as a platform without kind of talking to that person,” Shkreli said in the interview. “He’ll take my money, but he won’t engage with me for five minutes to understand this issue better.”
Shkreli tweeted about his donation during Tuesday night’s Democratic presidential candidate debate, without saying how much he had given. He also challenged both Sanders and Clinton to say whether they’d prefer that he reduce the price of his company’s anti-parasitic drug, Daraprim, or use the money to develop a better treatment.
In the interview, Shkreli said he wouldn’t be surprised if Sanders gave the money back. But he wants Sanders to hear him out about why drug companies have to spend so much money on research and development — which he insists Turing does — and explain what he thinks is a reasonable amount for them to charge in return.
“I’d ask him, what role does innovation play in health care?” Shkreli said. “Is he willing to sort of accept that there is a tradeoff, that to take risks for innovation, companies have to invest lots of money and they need some kind of return for that, and what does he think that should look like?”
“And quite frankly, what I’m worried [about] is that he doesn’t have an answer for that, that he’s appealing to the masses, that he’s just kind of talking out of his rear end so that he gets some votes,” Shkreli said.

If Sanders gets his way and drug prices are limited, though, Shkreli said he’ll deal with it.
“Right now the rule of law in the United States is that drug companies can price their products wherever they see fit, not wherever he sees fit,” Shkreli said. “If the rule changes by congressional vote, then you know, I’ll adapt to the rules.”
During the debate, Sanders took pride in his fights against the drug companies, saying, “I would lump Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry at the top of my list of people who do not like me.”
Still, Shkreli said he likes some of Sanders’ views. He said he is neither a Democrat nor a Republican, and believes both parties have good ideas. But he said he supports Sanders’ call for free public college for everyone, as well as better access to mental health care.
And he was especially enthusiastic when Sanders mentioned during the debate that he supported President Bill Clinton’s military intervention in Kosovo to prevent ethnic cleansing. Shkreli, who is Albanian, cited that statement on Twitter when he mentioned he had given money to Sanders.
“That hit me very hard. For a guy I didn’t expect to like, I couldn’t ignore that,” Shkreli said.
He also said he could support Jeb Bush, who seems “reasonable” to him. But he’s not impressed by Donald Trump, who reportedly called him a “spoiled brat.” Not true, Shkreli said: “I grew up in a very poor family.”

And he’s definitely not a fan of Clinton.
“I don’t think she really stands for anything. At least Bernie’s passionate and really kind of provocative,” Shkreli said. “I met Hillary years ago. I didn’t like her then, I still don’t like her now.”

","Conservatives are pushing for an unprecedented Constitutional convention of the states to make changes to the federal budget, term limits and the 17th Amendment.
""They literally see this as the survival of the nation,"" said Karla Jones, director of the federalism task force at the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, told the Associated Press in a report published on Saturday.
For nearly 230 years, any amendments to the Constitution have been made through acts of Congress with the support of two-thirds of both the House and the Senate. Once both chambers signed off on the proposal, at least three-quarters of the states would have to sign off on the amendment as well.
And even though amendments can originate in the states — a right granted in the second clause of Article V — it has never been done before. Different political groups have tried to call a convention to order, once in the 1980s and again in the 1960s, but neither attempt ever came to fruition.
And even though Republicans have controlled all three branches of government for nearly two years, momentum is building for a first-time convention. Legislation promoted by the Convention of States Project calling for a convention has now been passed by 12 states. The group claims that 18 other states are also considering the measure.
Mark Meckler, a leader of the Tea Party, told the Associated Press that the Constitutional convention ""was specifically intended for a time like this, when the federal government gets out of control and when the Congress won't deliver to the people what they want.""
Even with a Republican president, House of Representatives and Senate, the GOP has not managed to pass some of its ideal legislation. Efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, have been halted multiple times. And though Donald Trump has targeted immigrants with draconian policies, some would like to see non-whites treated even more harshly.
The possiblity that the GOP will lose control of the House to Democrats in the upcoming midterm elections will mean that conservatives will have an even harder time passing legislation.
But according to the report, some of the issues conservatives calling for a convention have in mind deal with establishing term limits for members of Congress and a potential repeal of the 17th Amendment, which allows the public to elect senators instead of the state legislatures.
In order for a Constitutional convention to be successful, two-thirds of the states must call for the convention and at least three-fourths must approve of the amendment or change."

","A white woman called police on a black family for barbecuing at an Oakland, California, park -- and broke down sobbing after they confronted her.
Michelle Snider recorded video of the incident late last month at Lake Merritt, where another visitor called police because she believed the family was breaking park rules by cooking, reported KRON-TV.
""This is exactly what is the problem with Oakland today,"" Snider said. ""This lady wants to sit here and call the police on them for having a barbecue at the lake as if this is not normal.""
The woman tells Snider that charcoal grills are ""illegal"" in that part of the park, and she calls police and threatens the black family with jail.
""She said that we were trespassing, we were not welcome, and then she turned back around and said, 'Y'all going to jail,'"" said Snider's husband, Kenzie Smith.
The family argues about park rules with the woman for about 10 minutes as she stays on the phone with dispatchers, and the woman complains about the police response time.
""They've got other things to do other than sit here and listen to another white lady complain about black people in Lake Merritt Park,"" Snider says. ""This is a park for everybody.""
Snider, who is white, mocks the woman as ""the f*cking coal Nazi police,"" and repeatedly asks her to return a card the woman took from her hand, and then the woman tells dispatchers the family is threatening her after she becomes impatient with police.
She follows the white woman across the street to a convenience store, continuously asking her to return the card, and the white woman begins to cry but does not return the item.
""I'm being harassed,"" the white woman says, sobbing, about 23 minutes into the video.
An officer asks Snider to back off the woman, and asks both women about the incident.
""I reported over two hours ago some people were illegally grilling in the park with a charcoal grill where they're not supposed to, I was waiting there for a response because I was told they're coming,"" the woman says through sobs. ""After two hours, I just called back the non-emergency line, and in the interim these people came up and started harassing me, physically pushing me.""
Snider denies her claims, and says she just wants her card back.
Barbecues were banned about three years on the eastern part of the lake, after complaints about trash and a toddler was burned by improperly disposed charcoal, but police did not cite the family.
Both women claimed the other harassed them, but police took no action but filed a report."
progressive,"http://www.rawstory.com/2016/03/dan-savage-clinton-crediting-nancy-reagan-for-helping-aids-victims-is-a-fcking-lie/
","Columnist and LGBT activist Dan Savage ripped Hillary Clinton on Friday for saying that former First Lady Nancy Reagan helped start ""a national conversation"" about the HIV virus.
""This is a f*cking lie,"" Savage wrote in The Stranger. ""You could only say the Reagans started ""a national conversation"" about AIDS if terrified, desperate, and dying people screaming ""WHY AREN'T YOU SAYING OR DOING ANYTHING ABOUT AIDS!"" at the Reagans counts. It does not.""
The former secretary of state, who is running for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, made her remarks earlier in the day before Reagan's funeral.
""Because of both President and Mrs. Reagan -- in particular Mrs. Reagan -- we started a national conversation when before nobody would talk about it, nobody wanted to do anything about it,"" Clinton said in an interview with MSNBC. ""And you know that too is something that I really appreciate with her very effective, low-key advocacy but it penetrated the public conscience. And people began to say, 'Hey, we have to do something about this too.'""
Savage argued that Clinton ""needs to walk this back immediately or she risks losing the votes of millions of queer Americans who survived the plague. We watched our friends and lovers die by the tens of thousands while Nancy and Ronnie sat silently in the White House.""
He also stated that he was ""literally shaking"" as he composed his criticism of Clinton.
""There are no words for the pain Clinton's remarks have dredged up,"" Savage wrote. ""I'm supposed to be writing a column—it's way overdue—but all I can think about right now are all of my dead friends, lovely guys who might still be with us if Nancy and Ronald Reagan had started a national conversation about HIV/AIDS. Or done something about it.""
Clinton's description regarding Reagan also runs counter to analyses published by The Guardian and Towleroad, among others, as well as a Buzzfeed report last year stating that she refused family friend Rock Hudson's request for help when he sought experimental treatment for the disease in France.
Update, 4:45 p.m. EST: Clinton released a short statement apologizing for her remarks.
""While the Reagans were strong advocates for stem cell research and finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease, I misspoke about their record on HIV and AIDS,"" the statement read. ""For that, I'm sorry.""
Clinton's remarks can be seen below."
progressive,"https://jimheath.tv/2019/02/matt-gaetz-trumps-top-defender-in-house-threatens-congressional-witness-exhibits-mob-behavior/
","Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) tweeted a threat to President Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen on the eve of his public testimony before the House Oversight Committee.
It is a new level of mafia-like behavior that has crept into politics during the Trump era.
Hey @MichaelCohen212 – Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she’ll remain faithful when you’re in prison. She’s about to learn a lot… — Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) February 26, 2019
Cohen originally postponed his appearance before various congressional committees in part because of “threats against his family” from Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani.
Cohen is expected to testify before two separate House committees this week that Trump directed him to commit multiple crimes.
They include sending illegal hush payments to two of the president’s former mistresses, and lying to Congress about the timeline of negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow.
Gaetz, a Trump loyalist, recently told the New York Times that he thinks it’s “right” that scrutiny of investigations by congressional Republicans has “aided in the president’s defense.”
“It’s that last line that seems really problematic,” said Stephen Vladeck, a professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law, “‘She’s about to learn a lot…’ What is the test implied in that statement, as opposed to the insinuation that as a result of his testimony, his wife is going to come into negative information about him?”
Last December, Trump applied the term “rat” to Cohen, who told a federal court that the president had directed him in violating campaign finance law, including by buying the silence of two women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump before he became president.
Remember, Michael Cohen only became a “Rat” after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable & unheard of until the Witch Hunt was illegally started. They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY’S OFFICE! Why didn’t they break into the DNC to get the Server, or Crooked’s office? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 16, 2018
The use of the rodent name for is someone who “secretly aids the police to apprehend criminals.”
Experts date its use in the “underworld” — the abode of criminals and organized crime — to 1902, while it began to be employed by police in the 1920s, as they squeezed the underlings of gangsters and mafia bosses enriching themselves in the illicit liquor trade.
It is most associated with infamous mob boss Al Capone.
Gaetz generated news earlier this month when, at a congressional hearing, he called for the removal of two fathers whose children were killed in last year’s mass shooting in Parkland, Florida.
Gaetz has a long history of controversial statements and actions, including inviting internet troll and occasional Holocaust denier Chuck Johnson to the State of the Union and becoming a leading voice in the brief movement to release a memo written by Republican Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) that many on the right believed would damage Robert Mueller’s investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign.
Gaetz even appeared on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’s show to discuss the memo.
His moralizing outrage defending Trump, opposing the Mueller investigation, and sticking up for the NRA is often met with contempt online from his critics.
Opponents of Gaetz point out he was arrested in 2008 for DUI.
He’s also been cited for at least 16 other driving violations since 1999."
progressive,"https://www.rawstory.com/2018/08/not-enough-impeach-trump-entire-presidency-annulled/
","The only way I see the end of Trump is if there’s overwhelming evidence he rigged the 2016 election. In which case impeachment isn’t an adequate remedy. His presidency should be annulled.
Let me explain. Many people are convinced we’re already witnessing the beginning of the end of Trump.
In their view, bombshell admissions from Trump insiders with immunity from prosecution, combined with whatever evidence Mueller uncovers about Trump’s obstruction of justice and his aide’s collusion with the Russians, will all tip the scales.
Democrats will take back the House and begin an impeachment, and the evidence of impeachable offenses will put enough pressure on Republican senators to send Trump packing.
I don’t believe this for a moment.
First, the Senate has never in history convicted a president of impeachment.
Second, even if Democrats flip the House in November, Republicans will almost certainly remain in control of the Senate – and so far they’ve displayed the integrity of lizards.
Third, Fox News and the rest of the right-wing sleaze media will continue to distort and cover up whatever the evidence shows – convincing 35 to 40 percent of Americans, along with most Republicans, that Trump is the innocent victim of a plot to remove him.
Finally, Trump himself will never voluntarily resign, as did Nixon. He’ll lie and claim a conspiracy to unseat him.
He’s proven himself a superb conman, an entertainer-demagogue capable of sowing so much confusion and instigating so much hate and paranoia that he has already survived outrages that would have broken any garden-variety loathsome president – Helsinki, Charlottesville, children locked in cages at the border, firings and cover-ups, racist slurs, clear corruption.
In all likelihood, we’ll have him for another two and a half years.
Don’t bet the house on him losing in 2020, either. A malignant bullying megalomaniac who lies like most people breathe, and who’s able to suck the oxygen out of every news cycle, might pulverize any Democratic opponent.
Even if he loses in 2020, we’ll be fortunate if he concedes without being literally carried out of the Oval Office amid the stirrings of civil insurgency.
Oh, and let me remind you that even if he’s impeached, we’d still have his loathsome administration – Pence on down.
But lest you fall into a miasma of gloom, there’s another scenario – unlikely, but entirely possible.
Suppose, just suppose, Robert Mueller finds overwhelming and indisputable evidence that Trump conspired with Putin to rig the 2016 election, and the rigging determined the election’s outcome.
In other words, Trump’s presidency is not authorized under the United States Constitution.
Suppose these findings are so compelling that even Trump loyalists desert him, the Republican Party decides it has had enough, and Fox News calls for his impeachment.
What then? Impeachment isn’t enough.
Impeachment would remedy Trump’s “high crimes and misdemeanors.” But impeachment would not remedy Trump’s unconstitutional presidency because it would leave in place his vice president, White House staff and Cabinet, as well as all the executive orders he issued and all the legislation he signed, and the official record of his presidency.
The only response to an unconstitutional presidency is to annul it. Annulment would repeal all of an unconstitutional president’s appointments and executive actions, and would eliminate the official record of the presidency.
Annulment would recognize that all such appointments, actions, and records were made without constitutional authority.
The Constitution does not specifically provide for annulment of an unconstitutional presidency. But read as a whole, the Constitution leads to the logical conclusion that annulment is the appropriate remedy for one.
After all, the Supreme Court declares legislation that doesn’t comport with the Constitution null and void, as if it had never been passed.
It would logically follow that the Court could declare all legislation and executive actions of a presidency unauthorized by the Constitution to be null and void, as if Trump had never been elected.
The Constitution also gives Congress and the states the power to amend the Constitution, thereby annulling or altering whatever provisions came before. Here, too, it would logically follow that Congress and the states could, through amendment, annul a presidency they determine to be unconstitutional.
As I’ve said, my betting is Trump remains president at least through 2020 – absent compelling and indisputable evidence he rigged the 2016 election.
But if such evidence comes forth, impeachment isn’t an adequate remedy because Trump’s presidency would be constitutionally illegitimate.
It should be annulled."

","Boris Johnson will veto any attempt by Donald Trump to bring Russia back into the G7, Downing Street said today.
The PM's spokesman said the was no evidence of 'changed behaviour' from Moscow since it was suspended from the bloc in 2014 following the annexation of Crimea.
Mr Trump said over the weekend that he will postpone a G7 summit from this month to the Autumn amid the coronavirus turmoil, despite previously suggesting it would be a good symbol that things were getting back to normal.
The president also revived the idea of expanding the group, saying Russia, Australia, South Korea and India could be invited.
Mr Trump told reporters on Air Force One as he returned to Washington from Florida that the current makeup of the group was 'very outdated' and did not represent 'what's going on in the world'
Donald Trump (pictured at the White House on Saturday) has said he wants to expand the G7 to include Russia again
Boris Johnson (pictured in Downing Street today) will veto any attempt by Donald Trump to bring Russia back into the G7, his spokesman said
The G7 members are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. The group´s presidency rotates annually among member countries.
The PM's spokesman pointed out today that any expansion had to be agreed unanimously.
'We will look at the detail of what the US is proposing. It is customary for the country that holds the G7 presidency to invite other leaders to participate as guests in the summit,' the spokesman said.
'Decisions on G7 membership need to be made unanimously by all G7 leaders. Russia was removed from the G7 group of nations following its annexation of Crimea and we are yet to see evidence of changed behaviour that would justify its re-admittance.
'We wouldn't support it being readmitted as a member of the group.'
Canada's Justin Trudeau has also signalled his opposition.
'Russia has yet to change the behavior that led to its expulsion in 2014, and therefore should not be allowed back into the G7,' he said at a news conference.
Mr Trump postponed the G7 after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's office said she would not attend unless the coronavirus was more under control.
The leaders of the world's major economies had been slated to meet this month at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland.
Mr Trump announced in March he was canceling the summit because of the pandemic and that the leaders would stage a video conference instead.
But he then switched course, saying a week ago that he was again planning to host a face-to-face meeting.
'Now that our Country is 'Transitioning back to Greatness', I am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, DC, at the legendary Camp David,' Trump tweeted.
'The other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all - normalization!'
Russia had been invited to attend the gathering of the world's most advanced economies since 1997, but was suspended in 2014 following its invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.
Mr Trump said he wanted to invite other countries including Russia to the meeting. Russian President Vladimir Putin is seen above in Moscow on Thursday"

","There’s a very specific analog between Biff Tannen, the bully and bad guy in almost every timeline in Back to the Future Part II, and a certain political figure who is rather popular in the United States right now. He’s been handed the keys to fortune, he’s unrepentantly used that fortune exclusively for himself, and he’s even become a public advocate for plastic surgery for women in his family.
It is not hard to put two and two together.
So, Bob Gale—writer of Back to the Future Part II and man who helped predict the IMAX theater and the self-checkout line—in these past few months, were you thinking what we’re all thinking?
“We thought about it when we made the movie! Are you kidding?” he says. “You watch Part II again and there’s a scene where Marty confronts Biff in his office and there’s a huge portrait of Biff on the wall behind Biff, and there’s one moment where Biff kind of stands up and he takes exactly the same pose as the portrait? Yeah.”
Of course, in the movie, Biff uses the profits from his 27-story casino (the Trump Plaza Hotel, completed in 1984, is 37 floors, by the way) to help shake up the Republican Party, before eventually assuming political power himself, helping transform Hill Valley, California, into a lawless, dystopian wasteland, where hooliganism reigns, dissent is quashed, and wherein Biff encourages every citizen to call him “America’s greatest living folk hero.”
“Yeah,” says Gale. “That’s what we were thinking about.”
Of course, in Back to the Future Part II, Marty McFly and Doc Brown fix it all just in the nick of time. They save themselves and America from Donald Tr… Biff Tannen.
Now, today, Marty and Doc are here to deliver the rest.
Today is the Future.Here’s the bad news: Today, October 21 , 2015, is the day Marty and Doc arrive in Downtown Hill Valley, California, to save Marty from going to jail, then go on your standard 2015 stolen hoverboard chase through the main street of an American town. So if you’re downtown, you might want to hoverchain your hoverboard to a hoverfire hydrant.
But here’s the good news: Bob Gale is very optimistic about our future. He’s thinking it’s closer to the borderline utopian one in his brain in the 1980s than the dystopian one he’d also dreamt up.
And that’s tremendous news for us all, because Bob Gale was very, very right the first time.
“We wanted to portray an optimistic, enjoyable, fun future, where the characters are still a mess,” he tells The Daily Beast.
Gale and director Robert Zemeckis did just that. In 2015, Marty wanders around the town square and is attacked by a 3D hologram of what would eventually be known as an IMAX 3D version of Jaws 19.
“We don’t have Jaws 19, but we have Sharknado 3,” he says.
At Cafe ’80s, Marty orders a Pepsi from Michael Jackson and Ronald Reagan imitators, the celebrity voices of what we’d now consider self-checkout lines.
And at the dinner table, Marty’s future kid even checks his phone. Sure, it’s on the giant sunglasses affixed to his face, but he’s still off in his own world.
“Nobody gets it right. You might get a few things right, but you’re gonna get a lot of things wrong,” says Gale. “We missed the smartphone entirely. How did we miss that? We just missed it. Everybody else missed it, too. It took Steve Jobs to come along and say, ‘Everybody, you’re gonna need this.’ In the future, trust me, there will be something else.”
But here’s the beautiful thing about Bob Gale’s 2045: It’s just as optimistic as his imagined 2015. He thinks there’s going to be something he calls GoogleMD, for example.
“It’ll be able to do a whole bio-examination of you, compare it to the data that Google has on 400 million other people, and be able to say ‘You need to cut back on the ice cream,’” he says.
But the truly gorgeous part of his future is that it will take the ugly, broken, pubescent cultural quagmires of now, and it will make them transcendent, comfortable, or even empowering.
“Privacy is going away. We’re not gonna have it anymore,” he says.
How do you deal with that? “You deal with it by not having any shame about the stupid stuff that you do. Because if that picture somebody took on Facebook of you being drunk, running down the street naked—if that gets out there— what are you gonna say?” he asks.
“You’re gonna say, ‘Welp, I was drunk. I took off my clothes. Haven’t you ever been there?’ So am I gonna be worried about that? No.”
If that sounds like a better future, a more hopeful future than now, it’s because it is.
“That’s what Bob Zemeckis and I believe: These movies are about personal responsibility. You need to be responsible for your own future, and if you do the right thing now, it’ll have positive results in the future,” says Gale.
Gale brings up the time Marty McFly travels to a timeline where his mother winds up becoming an alcoholic.
“If you do the wrong thing—‘You shouldn’t drink!’ ‘Why not?’ ‘You might regret it later in life!’—and it’s because he knows she’s a drunk? People think about that,” says Gale.
There’s a certain religion in that, isn’t there?
“‘Your future is exactly what you make of it,’ as Doc Brown would say. I’ve had people come up to me and say, ‘That bit of advice was really important for me to hear,’” he says.
“Look, people love Star Wars, but I don’t think ‘Use the Force’ is gonna help you live your everyday life.”
Now, Gale gets to do one last victory lap. He and Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd and Lea Thompson and co-writer Robert Zemeckis (and maybe, according to rumors, a pair of Nike Air Marty McFlys with power laces) will be at the Lincoln Center AMC Theater tonight, October 21, 2015, The Future, talking about everything they all got to act out that came from Gale’s big, futuristic brain.
And it’s about time. Since the early days of Photoshop, and even before it, Back to the Future fans have been so impatient for this day to come, they would doctor the screenshot of Doc Brown’s flux capacitor so it read every October 21 for, oh, the last 18 years.
“The hoaxes! If you go back to 1997 when the Florida Marlins won the World Series, they were saying, ‘This is the day from Back to the Future!’” says Gale. “I guess they just wanted a hoverboard.”
But now it’s really here, and Gale is still humbled by the entire idea of it.
“What is the movie of the last 10 years that we’ll be celebrating a 30th anniversary of that people will still be interested in?” he asks. “On the other hand, even in 1995, did people really believe in 2015 people would be talking about Back to the Future? Probably not. But it’s been very, very good to me.”
And what’s the driving force behind why this movie has endured? Why did it work in a theater in 1989, and on a VHS tape in the ’90s, and on a DVD in the ’00s, and for a kid seeing it on an iPad, beamed wirelessly, like magic, into a moving car, for the first time, today, The Future?Why does it still hold up?
Because the hate in it still loses. (We’re looking at you, Biff.) And the hope for a better future—hoverboard or not—is still possible.
“Growing up in the ’50s and ’60s, technology was our God. It gave us hope. It permeated our generation. And I think every kid today is still sitting, thinking, daydreaming about the future,” he says. “I hope so. I hope they are.”"

","Mr. Trump has praised the high quality of care he received at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and has played down the risk of the virus. “Don’t be afraid of Covid,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Monday, before returning to the White House. “Don’t let it dominate your life.”
Across the country, patients have struggled with both the long-term health and financial effects of contracting coronavirus. Nearly half a million have been hospitalized. Routine tests can result in thousands of dollars in uncovered charges; hospitalized patients have received bills upward of $400,000.
Mr. Trump did not have to worry about the costs of his care, which are covered by the federal government. Most Americans, including many who carry health coverage, do worry about receiving medical care they cannot afford.
For some Americans, the bills could start mounting with frequent tests. Insurers are generally required to pay for those tests when physicians order them, but not when employers do.
The Trump administration made that clear in June, when it issued guidance stating that insurers do not have to pay for “testing conducted to screen for general workplace health and safety.” Instead, patients need to pay for that type of testing themselves. Some might be able to get free tests at public sites, and some employers may voluntarily cover the costs. Others could face significant medical debt from tests delivered at hospitals or urgent care centers."

","Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) believes Attorney General Jeff Sessions misled him during a Senate confirmation about his contacts with Russian officials during the presidential campaign.
The Washington Post revealed late Wednesday that Sessions had met twice with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. while serving as a senator and campaign surrogate for the Donald Trump campaign.
""His responses to me weren't accurate,"" Franken told MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""I would like to see him answer questions at a press conference and then we can decide whether he should resign or not.""
Franken had asked Sessions during his Senate confirmation hearings whether he knew of any contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia -- and the Alabama Republican had volunteered that he had not.
""I asked him, there had been breaking news as we were recessing for a while in the hearings, (and) when we came back, it had broken that members of the Trump campaign had met with the Russians, and I asked him since he was -- they were hearings from the attorney general, what would he do if he learned that members of the Trump campaign team had been meeting with the Russians,"" Franken said. ""He didn't answer my question, which probably should have been, 'I'd recuse myself.' What he did was, instead he pivoted and said, 'I was a campaign surrogate or considered one, and I never met with the Russians. That is, at best, extremely misleading, and here we are.""
Sessions now admits he spoke to the ambassador, but Franken isn't reassured by the attorney general's claims that he does not recall the subject of their conversation.
""If you don't remember what you talked about, you don't remember that you didn't talk about the campaign,"" Franken said.
Franken said there was something ""hinky"" going on with the Trump campaign and Russia, and he called on the president to turn over his tax returns to determine his ties to that nation's oligarchs.
He said Sessions no longer had the credibility to oversee the Justice Department investigation into those alleged ties -- and he said the attorney general and the White House should not be allowed to choose a special prosecutor.
""These are contradictory statements and he should immediately recuse himself from any of this,"" Franken said."

","Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's office sent a cease-and-desist letter Friday to a former official who has claimed his bosses nixed a lawsuit six years ago against Trump University, the beleaguered school tied to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
In a letter dated Friday, First Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Mateer asks John Owens to ""immediately cease and desist from disclosing any privileged or confidential information"" from his time in the office, which ended when he retired in 2011. Owens, the former deputy chief of the consumer protection division, told reporters Thursday that then-Attorney General Greg Abbott gave Trump special treatment when he declined to pursue a $5.4 million lawsuit against Trump University.
""Current and former Assistant Attorneys General have a duty to follow all rules related to the practice of law in the state of Texas,” Mateer said in a statement. ""While everyone has First Amendment rights to free speech, the law strictly prohibits attorneys from releasing confidential and privileged information.""
The letter lays out a half dozen provisions Owens may have violated under state law and the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. The provisions center on the possession and distribution of confidential materials related to state investigations.
Owens issued a statement denying any wrongdoing.
""I have done nothing illegal or unethical as stated in the letter,"" Owens said. ""I think the information I provided to the press was important and needed to be shared with the public.""
Earlier Friday, former Deputy Attorney General David Morales issued a statement saying he, not Abbott, decided to pass on the lawsuit and that his his decision was not influenced by the fact the company was associated with Trump. He said that Trump University agreed to suspend its Texas operations as the state was demanding documents, and in 2010 agreed to permanently leave.
Abbott is facing a new wave of questions about the investigation into Trump University as Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton makes it an issue in her race against Trump. More than three years after the probe effectively ended, Abbott received two donations from Trump totaling $35,000 in his run for governor.
On Friday afternoon, Abbott made his feelings known about those suggesting a connection between the conclusion of the investigation and the campaign contributions.
""Story is bogus,"" Abbott tweeted. ""A few journalists peddling their agenda rather than getting all the facts tank the profession."""

progressive,"https://sparktoro.com/blog/we-analyzed-every-twitter-account-following-donald-trump-61-are-bots-spam-inactive-or-propaganda/
","Last week, SparkToro launched our third free tool, a service that analyzes Twitter accounts to estimate what percent of their followers are bots, spam, propaganda, or inactive accounts. By far the account that’s been most checked by users of the tool is @realdonaldtrump. Since there’s great interest in that account, we decided to expand our usual sample analysis (which looks at a random group of 2,000 followers) and run every single one of the account’s 54,788,369 followers through our system.
The results are… interesting.
As you can see, @realdonaldtrump is vastly above the median for these types of followers. For comparison, here’s how a number of other prominent American politicians look:
Donald Trump (President) – 61.0%
Kamala Harris (Senator) – 24.4%
Ted Cruz (Senator) – 26.0%
Susan Collins (Senator) – 24.6%
Mike Pence (Vice President) – 41.5%
Al Gore (Former Vice President) – 41.0%
Beto O’Rourke (Congressman) – 22.7%
Barack Obama (former President) – 40.9%
Mitch McConnell (Senator) – 31.3%
Jerry Brown (Governor) – 50.0%
Lindsey Graham (Senator) – 25.3%
Elizabeth Warren (Senator) – 33.7%
Hillary Clinton (former Senator) – 43.8%
The @realdonaldtrump account has significantly higher numbers than any other American politician we could find. That said, a few accounts do eclipse this, including @tina_kandelaki (a Russian journalist and personality) with 82.0% fake followers and Demokrat_TV (an Indonesian news source) with 69.2% fake followers.
It’s not just the high percent of fake followers that’s surprising, but the distribution of follower quality on the account:
More than 35% of @realdonaldtrump’s followers are accounts that trigger 10+ different spam/fake follower signals (and thus have the lowest possible quality score, “1”). When compared to the distributions of other accounts, it seems likely that @realdonaldtrump acquired significantly more of these highly unusual and suspicious followers than others. We can speculate about why, but these numbers can make you feel confident in saying that the account likely reaches far less than half of the follower number reported by Twitter (at least, on that platform).
Methodology
SparkToro’s analysis uses a machine-learning based process to uncover numerous signals that correlate with spam/bots/inactive/propaganda accounts. We then analyze how these signals compare for any given Twitter account’s followers. In a standard analysis, we look at a random 2,000 followers, but in the case of @realdonaldtrump, we analyzed every single one of the 54+ million accounts in question.
It’s extremely important to keep in mind that NO ONE SIGNAL means we’d treat an account as likely spam/bot/inactive/propaganda. An account needs a combination of 7-10+ of these signals to be counted as “fake.” Here’s how those signals stacked up for @realdonaldtrump:
72% have been inactive for 120+ days (i.e. the account did not send any tweets or RTs during that time)
3% have been inactive for between 90-120 days
3% created their account in the last 90 days
36% use Twitter’s default profile image
39% use display names that include spam words+patterns
92% either don’t use a URL in their profile or employ a URL with spam patterns
60% don’t use a recognized location
27% have set their language to something other than English
54% have gone more than a year without sending more than a handful of tweets
3% send an abnormally large number of tweets per day
96% have been placed on very few (or zero) lists
79% have an unusually small number of followers
76% follow an unusual number of accounts
74% employ spam-correlated keywords in their profile description
I have this sinking feeling that someone will undoubtedly point to one of these signals and say “but that doesn’t mean the account is spam/bot/propaganda/inactive!” so let me state this again: no one, two, three, or even six signals means we’ll treat an account as low quality. But, I think we’d all agree (and the machine learning model built off spam+bot accounts would concur) that it’s very rare that an account could have a combination of 7-10+ of the above signals and still be a real, active, human being regularly logging into their Twitter account. Not impossible, just exceptionally unlikely.
Takeaways
For us, as creators of the Fake Followers tool, the fact that the estimated number was 57.1% (off the 2,000 sample followers) and the total number was 61.0% (off all 54 million) makes us feel very good about the sampling methodology.
For those who use the tool, you can feel relatively confident that numbers often line up to expectations and that sampling barely reduces the accuracy of a comprehensive analysis.
For those interested in Trump’s Twitter account, there are several items of note:
The spike of extremely low quality followers that fire 10+ spam flags suggests that this account in particular has been the target of a lot of suspicious activity.
The ease with which these accounts can be identified suggests Twitter is unwilling (rather than unable) to identify and remove obvious spam/bots/inactive/propaganda accounts.
Comparison against other prominent and well-followed American politicians suggests that the issue is unique to, or at least amplified, on @realdonaldtrump vs. others.
There is no evidence (at least in this analysis) that Trump himself or those working for/with him, have anything to do with the acquisition of these suspicious accounts. It’s certainly plausible that behavior by non-Trump-associated entities could be behind the accounts.
The most generous theory one might assign is that many people signed up for Twitter, filled out no information, send very few or no tweets, but followed Trump’s account and few others, then abandoned the platform. That is certainly true for at least some of these fake followers, though the triggering of some of the spam flags (use of spam-correlated keywords in particular) and the fact that Trump’s account is so much higher in fake followers than others, makes this a less comprehensive explanation.
Over the summer, Twitter removed a large number of spam accounts, but clearly, there are tens of millions (or more) still remaining on the platform. The singer @KatyPerry supposedly “lost” 2.8 million spam accounts in Twitter’s cleanup, while @RealDonaldTrump lost an estimated 300,000. Those numbers are surprising, given that Perry’s account appears to have far fewer obviously detectable spam followers (40.6%).
Notably, this isn’t the first analysis of that account’s followers. Newsweek wrote that about half of @realdonaldtrump’s followers were fake or inactive in 2017. Several linguistic analyses of the content have also been performed with interesting results.
One final note — while @realdonaldtrump probably only reaches ~20-25 million Twitter accounts directly, press, media, and other social media users amplify his messages to reach a broader group. But, for this account, and for others, the direct use of the published follower numbers on Twitter is a pretty poor estimate of true reach."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal prosecutors on Friday moved to drop charges against the last 39 people accused of participating in a violent protest on the day of President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
The motion to dismiss charges by the U.S. attorney’s office seemingly ends an 18-month saga that started with the Justice Department attempting to convict more than 190 people.
That effort saw the government facing off against an intensely coordinated grassroots political opposition network that made Washington the focus of a nationwide support campaign — offering free lodging for defendants, legal coordination and other support.

Members of that activist network were declaring victory on Friday.
“This is huge news,” said Dylan Petrohilos, a Washington-based activist who was one of the original defendants, but had his charges dropped earlier this year. “The solidarity we showed as defendants won out.”
More than 200 people were arrested after the protest, during which several store windows were broken and a parked limo set ablaze. Two group trials ended in defeats for the U.S. Attorney’s Office, which was hindered by the fact that most protesters wore similar black clothing and covered their faces.
The first trial ended with acquittals for all six defendants. After that defeat, the government dropped charges against 129 defendants, including Petrohilos, saying prosecutors would focus on the defendants against whom they had the strongest evidence.
But a second trial for four people in May ended in acquittals on most charges and a hung jury on the rest.
Activists credited a unified defense strategy with prevailing. This strategy included persuading defendants — sometimes over the objections of their lawyers — not to accept plea bargains.
“Solidarity was what won the case,” said Sam Menefee-Libey, a member of the DC Legal Posse activist collective. “I hope that organizers and people on the left study it.”"

","Weeks into their government standoff at a federal wildlife refuge in eastern Oregon, a right-wing militia group's attempts to reconcile with a local Native American tribe by filming themselves rummaging through their belongings has sparked outrage.
In the three-minute YouTube video uploaded Wednesday by LaVoy Finicum, one of the men responsible for leading the armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near Burns since Jan. 2, Finicum and several other men are shown leafing through boxes of documents belonging to the Paiute tribe.
Finicum encourages tribe members to meet with the militia group to reclaim items ""rotting"" and ""wasting away"" at the government refuge, which is home to thousands of Paiute artifacts, including tools and weapons, as well as burial grounds. In the video, Finicum notes decades-old papers strewn across the floor, and one box allegedly containing a rat's nest.
""We are concerned about the way artifacts are stored here, the Paiute's artifacts, and so we're reaching out to the Paiute tribe to say we need to open up a communication,"" Finicum said. ""We want to make sure that these things are returned to their rightful owners and that they're taken care of.""
Despite the militiamen's assertion that they intend to save Paiute artifacts from the government, tribe members argue it is the militiamen that their belongings need protecting from. In a letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service last week, the tribe requested assistance in protecting Paiute artifacts from the armed protesters, calling for an inventory of items in the refuge, and criminal prosecution of the group under the Archeological Resources Protection Act.

""They continue to desecrate one of our most important sacred sites,"" Burns Paiute Tribal Chair Charlotte Rodrique said in a news release. ""They should be held accountable.""
Also contrary to the militia group's mission to transfer control of public land from the federal government to ranchers, the Paiute argue the refuge land is a part of the tribe's ancestral territory and have refused to meet with the group.
Other members of the community surrounding the wildlife refuge have also denounced the actions of the militia members, many of whom are not from Oregon. Harney County Judge Steve Grasty said he plans to hold leader Ammon Bundy—son of notorious Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy— responsible for the cost of providing security measures for the refuge, a bill that could be as high as $70,000 a day.

In total, the standoff has cost taxpayers nearly a half million dollars, according to Oregon Gov. Kate Brown. In letters to the White House and Department of Justice this week, Brown requested assistance from the FBI and other law enforcement in removing the militia group from federal land, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported.
""For the citizens of Harney County and indeed all Oregonians, I must insist on a swift resolution to this matter,"" Brown wrote. ""Efforts to negotiate have not been successful, and now it is unclear what steps, if any, federal authorities might take to bring this untenable situation to an end and restore normalcy to this community."""

","UPDATE, July 8, 2015: Former Judge for the International Court of Justice at the Hague tells Newsweek that he believes former Vice-President Dick Cheney should and will be tried before the tribunal at the Hague for war crimes. Considered by many the world’s most distinguished living specialist in international human rights law, Thomas Buergenthal served as Dean of the American University Washington College of Law from 1980 to 1985 before serving for ten years on the International Court of Justice.
Video footage shows students walking out on Dick Cheney while he was speaking at American University in March of 2014. The students were protesting his foreign policy, and calling him a “War criminal” as they left the arena.
As reported by American University’s The Eagle, the former vice-president denied allegations that he was a war criminal saying that “the accusation are not true.”
Cheney had previously denied using torture in a pre-talk interview with ATV, the student-run television station at American University, saying: “Some people called it torture. It wasn’t torture.”
Cheney told the crowd that during his vice-presidency three people had been waterboarded.
According to Cheney, the enhanced interrogation tactics used do not fall under the scope of the 1949 United Nations Geneva Convention, which outlaws cruel, inhuman or any degrading treatment or punishment because the Geneva Convention does not apply to unlawful combatants. The Bush administration considered terrorists as unlawful combatants and considered those undergoing enhanced interrogation tactics as terrorists. “If I would have to do it all over again, I would,” Cheney said. “The results speak for themselves.”

","Representative Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic Texas Senate challenger, took a page from President Donald Trump's book on Tuesday evening, borrowing the president's 2016 nickname ""Lyin' Ted"" to describe his opponent, incumbent Senator Ted Cruz.
""Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you... He's dishonest. It's why the president called him 'Lyin' Ted,' and it's why the nickname stuck. Because it's true,"" O'Rourke said during the second senatorial debate.
Cruz took the jab well, and laughed before he shot back at O'Rourke. ""Well, it's clear Congressman O'Rourke's pollsters told him to come out on the attack,"" Cruz said.
Some O'Rourke supporters have been following the Cruz campaign around in a truck blasting President Trump's 2016 tweet about Cruz: ""Why would the people of Texas support Ted Cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them. He is another all talk, no action pol!"" goes their message. Trump won Texas by nine points in the presidential election, after waging a primary campaign against Cruz in which he repeatedly insulted the senator's family.
In the previous senatorial debate between O'Rourke and Cruz, the Texas senator said he had decided to look past Trump's insults in order to focus on what was best for the country. Cruz said that the presidential election was ""unlike any other,"" and that he had put aside his hurt feelings because ""I've got a responsibility, which is to fight for everybody here and every person in this state.""
Still, in a political ad directed by Richard Linklater that was not funded or approved by O'Rourke, actor Sonny Carl Davis attacked Cruz's approval and endorsement of Trump. ""If somebody called my wife a dog and said my daddy was in on the Kennedy assassination, I wouldn't be kissing their ass,"" he said. ""You stick a finger in their chest and give 'em a few choice words. Or you drag their ass out by the woodshed and kick their ass, Ted. Come on, Ted.""
O'Rourke's dig came in the middle of a heated debate between the candidates. The two squared off on hot-button issues like access to abortion, election security, health care, tariffs and border security and often jumped at each other in disagreement. O'Rourke and Cruz are embattled in a close race that has grabbed national attention.
Tuesday's debate took place before a studio audience of about 120 people and will be the final debate before early voting begins in Texas on Monday. Election day is Tuesday, November 6."

","PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:
First of all, the notion that I or Hillary or Democrats or whoever you want to choose are hell-bent on taking away folks' guns is just not true.
And I don't care how many times the NRA says it. I'm about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I have been president than just about any time in U.S. history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country.
And at no point have I ever, ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it's just not true.
What I have said is precisely what you suggested, which is, why don't we treat this like every other thing that we use? I just came from a meeting today in the Situation Room in which I got people who we know have been on ISIL Web sites, living here in the United States, U.S. citizens, and we're allowed to put them on the no-fly list when it comes to airlines, but because of the National Rifle Association, I cannot prohibit those people from buying a gun.
This is somebody who is a known ISIL sympathizer. And if he wants to walk in to a gun store or a gun show right now and buy as much — as many weapons and ammo as he can, nothing's prohibiting him from doing that, even though the FBI knows who that person is.
So, sir, I just have to say, respectfully, that there is a way for us to have commonsense gun laws. There is a way for us to make sure that lawful, responsible gun owners like yourself are able to use them for sporting, hunting, protecting yourself, but the only way we're going to do that is if we don't have a situation in which anything that is proposed is viewed as some tyrannical destruction of the Second Amendment. And that's how the issue too often gets framed."

","Republicans have, of course, turned Reagan into an icon, portraying him as the savior of a desperate, declining nation. Mostly, however, this is just propaganda. You’d never know from the legend that economic growth under Reagan was only slightly faster than it had been under Jimmy Carter, and slower than it would be under Bill Clinton.
And rapidly rising income inequality meant that a disproportionate share of the benefits from economic growth went to a small elite, with only a bit trickling down to most of the population. Poverty, measured properly, was higher in 1989 than it had been a decade earlier.
Anyway, gross domestic product isn’t the same thing as well-being. Other measures suggest that we were already veering off course.
For example, in 1980 life expectancy in America was similar to that in other wealthy nations; but the Reagan years mark the beginning of the great mortality divergence of the United States from the rest of the advanced world. Today, Americans can, on average, expect to live almost four fewer years than their counterparts in comparable countries.
The main point, however, is that under Reagan, irrationality and hatred for facts began to take over the G.O.P.
There has always been a conspiracy-theorizing, science-hating, anti-democratic faction in America. Before Reagan, however, mainstream conservatives and the Republican establishment refused to make alliance with that faction, keeping it on the political fringe.
Reagan, by contrast, brought the crazies inside the tent.
Many people are, I think, aware that Reagan embraced a crank economic doctrine — belief in the magical power of tax cuts. I’m not sure how many remember that the Reagan administration was also remarkably hostile to science."

","Item: Last week Republicans in the North Carolina House used the occasion of 9/11 to call a surprise vote, passing a budget bill with a supermajority to override the Democratic governor’s veto. They were able to do this only because most Democrats were absent, some of them attending commemorative events; the Democratic leader had advised members that they didn’t need to be present because, he says, he was assured there would be no votes that morning.
Item: Also last week, Representative Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, issued a subpoena to the acting director of national intelligence, who has refused to turn over a whistle-blower complaint that the intelligence community’s inspector general found credible and of “urgent concern.” We don’t know what the whistle-blower was warning about, but we do know that the law is clear: Such complaints must be referred to Congress, no exceptions allowed.
On the surface, these stories may seem to be about very different things. The fight in North Carolina is basically about the G.O.P.’s determination to deny health care to low-income Americans; the governor had threatened to veto any budget that didn’t expand Medicaid. The whistle-blower affair probably involves malfeasance by high government officials, quite possibly President Trump, that in some way threatens national security.
What the stories have in common, however, is that they illustrate contempt for democracy and constitutional government. Elections are supposed to have consequences, conveying power to the winners.

","Now that Donald Trump has failed in his campaign promise to promptly repeal and replace Obamacare with something better, it’s time to turn to his next promise: tax reform.
Don’t be fooled. Trump has already severely reduced his big tax cut promise to the vast majority.
As for the federal tax system overall, Trump’s own words show he has no plan to address the deep structural problems in the federal tax system, created by the political donor class trading campaign contributions for tax favors.
Trump would do nothing to change rules that convert the burden of federal taxes into a profit center for multinational companies and some wealthy individuals, including himself. What Trump’s words show is that he wants massive new tax breaks for those at the very top, especially himself, with only a dollop of tax savings for the vast majority.
Taxes for Most Americans
Let’s start with how the vast majority would fare.
Congress currently exempts an individual’s first $10,400 per year from federal income tax ($20,800 for married couples).
Trump promised to more than double those figures. “If you are single and earn less than $25,000, or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you will not owe any income tax,” Trump told voters in writing.
Trump reneged last September, however, telling the New York Economic Club he would exempt only $15,000 for singles ($30,000 for married couples). That’s a 40% reduction in his promise. For more, see How Income Taxes Could Change Under President Trump.
Mink vs. Sable at the Top Tier
Now let’s look at the high end. Trump’s 2005 tax return, which I got in the mail two weeks ago, showed $152.7 million of income. That was enough to put him high up among the 400 largest incomes reported that year.
Trump now says Congress should lower the top individual income tax rate from 39.6% percent to 25% percent. But that break isn't generous enough for him: Under his plan, those in Trump's personal sub-class of ultra-rich business owners would get an even more lavish break– a tax rate of just 15%. That would mean for each dollar of income tax top-ranked business owners now pay they would turn over less than 38 cents.
People who work for someone else, however, would not be eligible for these incredible tax savings. Executives, top sales agents and other highly paid employees would be taxed at 25% percent, a big discount from today, but two-thirds higher than owners would pay. The top execs get mink, but the owners get sable.
Compare the tax bill for two people, each of whom makes $100 million in a year: an owner like Trump who gets to take his money as business profits and a CEO who is an employee. Trump would pay $15 million. The CEO would pay $25 million.
Overall Trump’s tax plan would add $7.2 trillion to the federal debt in the first decade, the Tax Policy Center estimated, using its computer model, which has proved reliable in past projections.
Under Trump’s plan a married couple who work all year to gross $500,000 in salaries would pay the same marginal tax rate as an employee who earns $100 million—and a much higher rate than Trump himself.
Should this go through, it will be interesting to see if tax warfare erupts at the top—or whether the elite will just invent a new way of paying top employees to re-classify them as quasi-owners.
Big Cuts Didn't Work Before
Trump says his 15% rate for business owners will spur economic growth. There is little to no empirical support for that claim. The last tax cuts aimed this way didn’t achieve that goal.
Consider what happened from 2001 through 2012, the 12 years when the George W. Bush tax cuts for those at the top and for investors were in full effect. Adjusted for population and inflation, Americans reported $6.6 trillion less income in those years than if the country had stayed at the level of 2000, the year candidate Bush chose as his base to measure the promised success of his tax cut plans.
That never-earned income of $6.6 trillion is about $48,000 per household. Looked at another way: Had that income been earned and taxed at the average federal income tax rate—and had all of it been subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes as well—America would be economically very healthy today.
That $6.6 trillion in after-tax money would have been enough to pay off every car loan, every credit card debt, every student loan in the U.S. And after all those taxes and debts were paid off, there would have been a pile of cash left – an average of $17,800 for every taxpayer.
So, what’s different this time? Would Trump’s tax cut plans double economic growth from around 2% annually to 4%, as he claims? Trump’s promises are built ""on very rosy economic assumptions that I don't think are going to come to fruition,"" Marc Goldwein of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said after the New York Economic Club address. Many other economists and tax wonks concur.
The Taxes that Got Away
While planning huge cuts at the top, Trump’s plan does nothing to defray these tax revenue losses by tapping other sources of possible revenue.
Living on Borrowed Money. Currently, many billionaires are enjoying multiple mansions, private jets and yachts, but paying little or no income tax. Here's how that can happen:
If you had a billion you could borrow against it, maybe at 2% interest, which is far below the 15% tax rate Trump proposes for business owners. Let's say you have $1 billion in non-dividend paying stocks growing at 5% annually and you want to spend $20 million on your lifestyle. You borrow the $20 million at 2% interest (a bank's best customers get much lower rates than the rest of us). At year end you owe $20.4 million. But your wealth has grown by $50 million, so you are richer than before, ahead by almost $30 million. And—since you didn't sell any of those stocks—you don't owe even a dollar to Uncle Sam. Each year you will get richer and richer with no taxes.
Trump proposes to do exactly nothing about this.
What should happen: Congress should impose rules that make such borrowing taxable income, just as it imposes limits on how much mortgage interest is deductible and how much can go into pension plans and retirement savings.
Deferred Income. Likewise, Trump proposes to do exactly nothing about tax deferrals, a huge source of tax favoritism to the super rich, many of whom can earn now and pay their tax decades later. Deferral is a key to turning taxes from a burden into a source of profit.
Here's how the system that burdens most of us actually converts federal individual and the corporate income tax into a profit center for the politically favored.
If you are a multinational corporation, a manager of a hedge or private equity fund, a corporate executive, a movie star or a top athlete you can earn now and pay by-and-by. Congress lets these privileged citizens borrow their taxes from the government at zero interest for as long as they choose—as long as they follow the rules about deferred income. Those rules exclude Joan and Joe Sixpack, who legally cannot get their pay or pension money until taxes are first deducted and given to Uncle Sam.
This rich people’s entitlement—unlimited interest-free loans from Uncle Sam—gets no attention in the Trump tax plan.
What should happen: Congress should restore the liquid-assets limits that have applied to domestic corporations since 1909. Then it should declare that profits sent offshore will be subject to a stiff penalty tax unless they are repatriated (and made subject to the regular 35% corporate tax rate) within one year.
Corporate Tax Escapes. Then there’s the disparate way Congress taxes foreign and domestic companies, an area where Trump promises more favors for the multinationals. Think of that as his anti-reform plan.
When federal and corporate income taxes are combined, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said this month, the formal federal corporate income tax rate is 39.1%. But the actual rate paid is less than half as much at 18.6%, according to the CBO.
That’s because the multinationals, which tend to be the biggest firms, are legally allowed to siphon taxable profits out of the United States and put the money into tax havens where little or no tax is due. Some big multinationals report their tax liability as a negative number year after year, meaning those companies profit from the tax system, a truth obscured by accounting conventions that need updating. What If You Were Taxed Like a Multinational? explains some of the details.
Congress treats industries and their financial structures so differently that for a decade it levied General Electric profits at 11.8% while the parent of The New York Times paid a 71% rate on its vastly smaller profits. (Full disclosure: I am a former New York Times reporter.)
What should happen: This is a complex area, but basically our system overtaxes manufacturers and undertaxes financial, digital and multinational corporations. I’ll explain how to deal with this in a future column.

Don’t Be Fooled
Trump wants tax savings for himself and the swamp people he promised to drain right out of the nation’s capital. Now that he is in office, Trump is trying to turn Washington into a tax paradise for himself and other very rich people, a paradise the rest of us will be taxed to pay for unless we demand better."

","Inside the White House, poetic justice looks a lot like Donald Trump.
Past and present aides to President Barack Obama are gloating that a Republican leadership they say defined itself by blustery opposition — and used it to win the House, then the Senate, and stand in the White House’s way at every turn — is getting devoured by a candidate personifying the anger agenda.
Obama insiders would rather have immigration reform signed than lament knowingly on Sunday talk shows that the Republicans will keep losing elections until they deal with the issue. They’d rather have a longer-term approach to government spending, or more of the entitlement and tax reform deals Obama said he was eager to cut.
But on everything from guns to reproductive health to opening up Cuba, Obama’s team says it has been battling for years the very politics that paved the way for Trump’s ascendance this election cycle.
“It’s not so much a reaction to Obama,” said one person familiar with the president’s thinking about the Trump phenomenon. “It’s more of a reaction to their strategy that, ‘We’re just going to be antithetical to everything [Obama] stands for.’”
According to people in the White House, Obama doesn’t talk about Trump much. When he does, it’s with a combination of amusement and disgust at the rhetoric, occasionally mentioning his amazement at GOP leaders’ inability to understand Trump’s supporters and the long-term damage the president thinks Trump is doing to the party with the groups of voters who will decide future elections.
“Coming out of 2008 and the demographic changes in the country, Republicans needed energy, and instead of reaching for new ideas and new leadership, they reached for the political equivalent of Four Loko,” said Hari Sevugan, a senior spokesman for Obama’s 2008 campaign. “Sure it gives a shot of energy, but it eventually rots your brain and kills you.”
But it’s more than told-ya-so. It’s personal.
The West Wing still burns over Trump leading the birth certificate charge in 2012, forcing an official rebuttal from the White House and the release of the president’s long-form birth certificate. Aides say Trump played into fears and racism and encouraged voter distrust of the president, as he’s doing now on the campaign trail.
Obama administration alumni remember hearing what they call the “those people” strain of politics when they were knocking on doors in 2008. It was evident at rallies for Sarah Palin and at tea party events in the first term of his presidency. Americans weren’t wrong to think Obama’s election in 2008 meant the country had changed — the president himself bought into it and was frustrated in the early years to see how slowly it translated into policy accomplishments.
Still, Obama’s team refuses to see Trump’s political success as some kind of backlash against the president.
“In the long sweep of history, this chapter is all pretty simple: The country actually switched from one dominant culture that was in charge for 240 years to one that’s multicultural,” said one Obama campaign veteran. “And that wasn’t going to go easy. But now we’re in the middle of it, so it seems chaotic and complicated.”
They also won’t concede that Trump might win. The billionaire real estate developer’s six months atop the GOP primary race have coincided with arguably the most successful year of Obama’s presidency — scoring deals with Iran and Cuba and on climate change and trade, and seeing previous efforts on Obamacare and gay marriage secured by the Supreme Court. That this all happened simultaneously with Trump’s rise demonstrates how little support Trump politics has in the country, Obama’s aides say.
“It’s not that the country has changed, it’s that a narrow band of mostly white, low- and middle-income Americans are supporting a candidate who is speaking to their anxiety about being left behind in this economy,” said Bill Burton, a former deputy White House press secretary. “Under no circumstances could Trump get a majority of Americans to support the nonsense and intolerance that he espouses.”
After all, Burton said, there’s not a lot of overlap between the people showing up at Trump rallies and the ones who had HOPE posters pinned on their walls eight years ago.
“What we are seeing play out in the Republican primary is a conversation between the GOP and itself about what kind of party it wants to be,” said Brent Colburn, the communications director for Obama’s reelection campaign. “No one who has ever worked for President Obama is surprised by the fact that there is a deeply divisive wing of the Republican Party. That was true in 2008, it was true in 2012, and, sadly, that is turning out to be true in 2016.”
But it’s not just about the GOP. White House aides say they are legitimately concerned that Trump is damaging America’s reputation around the world. It’s more than just Trump’s rhetoric playing into ISIL recruitment, they say; to people watching overseas, he’s eating away at ideals of what America’s supposed to stand for.
Going into next year, Obama will be speaking out against Trump, as he did indirectly in several pro-immigration speeches earlier this month and by name in an interview with NPR last week, when he argued that the Republican front-runner is exploiting the fears of “particularly blue-collar men [who] have had a lot of trouble in this new economy.” And pushing back against Trump will be a central theme of Obama’s international engagement.
“The nature of American politics is that all these statements are consumed around the world,” said deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes. “When there are statements that could present challenges in terms of perceptions of America’s openness to people of different faiths and America’s inclusiveness, the president is going to speak out on that.”
Obama loyalists like to point out that Trump’s been good at two things in his career — sales and bankruptcy. So when asked what Trump’s rise says about Obama’s America, the president’s team likes to note that Trump hasn’t won a single vote yet.
“The rise of Trump says more about the lack of progress in the GOP since 2008 than the progress the country has made since the president came into office,” Sevugan said. “But there's only one way to find out if the country has changed: Nominate Trump.”"

"," -- Newly declared presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders said today he hopes to lead a ""political revolution"" for working families and against money in politics in his bid for the White House.
""I think I'm the only candidate who's prepared to take on the billionaire class,"" Sanders, I-Vt., told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on ""This Week."" ""We need a political revolution in this country involving millions of people who are prepared to stand up and say, enough is enough, and I want to help lead that effort.""
Sanders, who will run in the Democratic primary against Hillary Clinton, told ABC's Jonathan Karl earlier this week the millions of dollars flowing into the Clinton Foundation poses a ""very serious problem.""
""It's not just Hillary. It's the Koch Brothers. It is Sheldon Adelson,"" he said, referring to billionaire backers of conservative causes and candidates. ""Can somebody who is not a billionaire who stands for working families actually win an election?""
Sanders could challenge Clinton from her left. He opposed the Iraq War, which Clinton supported in the Senate, and is against Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which the Obama administration is trying to get through Congress.
Clinton fully supported TPP as secretary of state but has raised reservations about it since announcing her presidential bid.
""Hillary Clinton has been part of the political class for many, many years,"" Sanders said. ""I respect her and I like her, but I think what the American people are saying, George, is ... maybe it's time for a real political shakeup in this country.""
He has raised more than $1.5 million since announcing his campaign on Thursday, but has pledged not to have a Super PAC that could accept unlimited contributions.
A self-described socialist who won his first election to become mayor of Burlington, Vermont, by just 10 votes, Sanders has a message for his doubters.
""Very few people thought that I would beat an incumbent Republican to become United States congressman from Vermont by 16 points,"" Sanders said. ""And people weren't so sure I could beat the richest person in Vermont to become a United States senator.
""Don't underestimate me,"" he added."

","“These fines, fees, and penalties can trap people in a cycle of debt, and low- ­income people and people of color are often hit the hardest,” the ordinance, which takes effect July 1, acknowledged. “Under this system, government becomes a driver of inequality.”
AD
California, like virtually every other state in the country, fines people who are convicted of felonies, misdemeanors and traffic violations as punishment for violating the law. But on top of those fines, states also charge often exorbitant fees. Some fees underwrite the costs of the justice system, such as incarceration or court construction. Others go directly into a state or municipality’s general fund.
AD
In California, many of these fees are mandatory — a county such as San Francisco has no choice but to impose them. But some of the fees are discretionary; a county can determine which of a number of fees to assess. Until now, every county in California has exercised its discretion to charge fees. For example, San Francisco charged a monthly probation fee of $50, which added up to $1,800 for the average three-year probation term. Individuals subject to electronic monitoring paid $35 a day for their ankle bracelet.
AD
Fines and fees do not affect only those with criminal convictions. Even a minor traffic offense can saddle a person with crippling debt. In many states, people who cannot afford to pay their fines and fees immediately are subject to interest charges and late-payment fees. They may have their driver’s or occupational license suspended. They may not be able to vote, and they may even go to jail. An emerging body of research reveals that debt from fines and fees often forces families to choose between paying their debt or paying for essential goods and services such as health care, food or housing. Court debt limits access to employment and student loans and adversely affects credit.
AD
Communities of color are most likely to suffer from abusive fines and fees practices because of overpolicing, the demographics of poverty (a majority of people living in poverty in the United States are people of color) and racism. A recent study found a “clear positive relationship” between revenue from fines and fees and the proportion of black residents in a city. Notably, cities with black city council members are much less likely to rely on fines and fees for revenue than those without them.
The irony is that while we impose millions of dollars of debt, we don’t collect much of it. A 2015 study found that Florida courts assessed $278 million in felony fines and fees in 2013 but recouped less than 14 percent of that total. In Washington state, where the cost of a typical felony conviction hovers around $2,500, half of sentenced felonies have a collections rate of zero — and when defendants do pay, data show that they are only able to pay on average 20 percent of their total debt. This fiscal inefficiency holds true for San Francisco as well, where a study this year showed the collection rate was around 17 percent for the $15 million in court debt accumulated over six years by about 20,000 individuals. We are quite literally making people’s lives miserable for nothing.
AD
The San Francisco ordinance will not solve the problem of fines and fees even in San Francisco, where judges must still impose mandatory state fines and fees that, according to the state’s Legislative Analyst’s Office, are used to fund more than 50 government programs. But by recognizing the inherent unfairness and profoundly harmful consequences of the “justice tax,” the San Francisco Supervisors expressly hope “to inspire other jurisdictions to lift this burden off low-income families, and to find more fair and just ways to fund their criminal justice systems.”
AD
The job of the justice system is to do justice, not to raise revenue through hidden taxes imposed on those who can least afford them. Cities and states throughout the country should follow San Francisco’s example and eliminate these unfair and profoundly harmful fees.

","Believe it or not, there was another atrocity in our politics over the weekend. This atrocity can kill at a respectable remove from the perpetrators. From the LA Times:
Their fears turned out to be true. Funding for CHIP runs out on Saturday, and no vote on reestablishing the program’s $15-billion appropriation is expected for at least a week, probably longer. That’s the case even though CHIP is one of the few federal programs that has enjoyed unalloyed bipartisan support since its inception in 1997. The consequences will be dire in many states, which will have to curtail or even shut down their children’s health programs until funding is restored. Hanging in the balance is care for 9 million children and pregnant women in low-income households.
Christamighty, these gossoons spent so much time trying to strip health care from 32 million Americans that they ran out the clock on health care for nine million kids. This is terrible if it represents simple legislative incompetence, but it’s even worse if—as I suspect—it was deliberate.
Agreement on a bill had been reached in mid-September by Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). “Momentum was building,” says Bruce Lesley, president of First Focus, a children’s advocacy group in Washington. Then came Cassidy-Graham, and “we couldn’t even get a meeting,” Lesley says. “No one was even taking our calls.” The impact of delay varies by state, because states are able to apply unspent CHIP money in any fiscal year to the next year. But even those with money in their coffers can’t escape the consequences of Congress’ inaction. Because they can’t merely assume that Congress will eventually get around to reauthorizing the funding, they have to start planning to shut down their programs now, or reallocate funding from other social programs. According to Medicaid officials, who manage CHIP from the federal end, California, Arizona, Minnesota and North Carolina will run out of CHIP funding by December or early in January. Half the states won’t make it beyond the first three months of 2018. Some will run out of money next week.
Lovely.
Don’t worry, though. The House of Representatives is on the case. In a tweet earlier Monday morning, Maggie Haberman of The New York Times pointed us to this statement from a “House GOP aide” that claims that the funding won’t run out until December.
This atrocity can kill at a respectable remove from the perpetrators.
First of all, contra this House GOP Aide, Minnesota officials have pointed out to their congressional delegation that their state’s money ran out this past weekend. Second, this is not a scenario that should give anyone much hope. If the thinking within the Republican congressional majority is that they have another two months leeway with this program, then I don’t think it unreasonable to assume that they will use it as a bargaining…er…chip in the upcoming slanging match over the budget, thus making the health coverage for nine million kids a hostage to, say, the elimination of the estate tax. Are they above doing this? Are you kidding me?

","Coretta Scott King, the widow of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., died in 2006. But her opinion on the man who is now President Donald Trump’s attorney general is still being talked about today.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., tried to read a 1986 letter by Coretta Scott King that criticized Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., as the Senate was considering his confirmation for attorney general. (He was ultimately confirmed on a near-party-line vote.) Before Warren could finish reading the letter, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell successfully silenced her under an obscure Senate rule.
The Senate’s decision to silence Warren energized her supporters. But it wasn’t long before conservative corners of the Internet tried to push a counter-narrative showing Coretta Scott King as favorable towards Sessions.
On Feb. 8, an aggregation site called True Pundit published a post with the headline, ""SHATTERED: Video of Coretta Scott King Thanking Jeff Sessions for Rosa Parks Library Crushes Elizabeth Warren Racial Stunt.""
Here’s the rest of the post, which also referenced a controversy over Warren and whether she had American Indian heritage:
Well, that was quick. Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s racial stunt that sparked her removal from the senate floor Tuesday night proved even shorter than her time living in a teepee.
Warren attempted to use the words of Coretta Scott King, the widow of slain civil rights hero Martin Luther King Jr., to smear Sen. Jeff Sessions’ bid for Attorney General. Warren’s now warrant-less claim was that King’s wife’s words framed Sessions as a bigot.
But now a more recent video has surfaced where Coretta King in fact praises Sessions at the launching of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum.
What a difference 12 hours can make.
Several readers were curious about what the attached video showed, so we took a closer look. (True Pundit did not respond to an inquiry through its website.)
The event in question was the Dec. 1, 2000, dedication of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum, located on the Montgomery, Ala., campus of Troy State University (since renamed Troy University). Parks had helped spark the civil rights movement in 1955 when she defied Alabama’s Jim Crow racial laws by refusing to relinquish her seat in the front of a municipal bus in Montgomery.
Speakers at the dedication included Parks herself; Coretta Scott King; civil rights widow Juanita Jones Abernathy; civil rights leaders Johnnie Mae Carr, Dorothy Height, Evelyn Lowery, Elaine Steele, Mammie Till-Mobley; actor Cicely Tyson; and several elected and appointed officials, including Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman, Montgomery mayor Bobby Bright, Troy State-Montgomery chancellor Jack Hawkins and president Cameron Martindale, U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, and Sessions.
Here’s a transcript of what King said on the YouTube video embedded in the website. A complete video of her address has been archived by C-SPAN, starting around the 1:06:44 mark.
To President Martindale, to Sen. Sessions, Mayor Bright, Troy State Chancellor Jack Hawkins Jr., Dr. Dorothy Height, Ms. Johnnie Carr, Juanita Abernathy, Mammie Till-Mobley, to all of the distinguished program participants and guests in this audience today, it's a great honor and a privilege for me to join you in celebrating the grand opening of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum. History teaches us that all great freedom movements begin with an inspiring act of courage, and in this regard the American civil rights movement provides a supreme example. The library and museum we dedicate today is a living testament to the courage, commitment and character of the great woman whose act of courage sparked our freedom struggle, the woman we call Mrs. Rosa Louise Parks. In her extraordinary courage and humility, Mrs. Rosa Parks provided our movement with a matchless example of the very spirit of non-violence.
That was the only time King mentioned Sessions in her speech -- and it her words fall well short of ""thanking"" him, whether for his role in establishing the library or for anything else. She simply acknowledged his presence in the room, as she did with other dignitaries.
We checked with Jeff Shesol, a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton who is now a founding partner of West Wing Writers, which does speechwriting for a variety of clients.
""This is the verbal equivalent of a wave or a handshake,"" Shesol said. ""In speechwriting, we call this the ‘acknowledgments’ section -- a list of people that you simply have to mention, in passing, given their office or stature. The sort of people who you can't risk slighting by appearing to ignore them.""
Shesol said there is a separate category of salute that qualifies as a genuine thank you.
""When someone needs to be singled out and thanked for their role in something, or for their contribution or leadership, that requires the speaker to pause and say something grateful and meaningful,"" he said.
And King did just that later in her speech, in a portion not shown in the YouTube clip that True Pundit appended to its post. In her remarks, King specifically thanked the Montgomery Improvement Association and Troy State University for their efforts on helping establish the library and museum.
""What you have here is a willful misinterpretation of a very basic gesture,"" Shesol said of the way True Pundit framed its post.
Our ruling
True Pundit said a video shows ""Coretta Scott King thanking Jeff Sessions for Rosa Parks library.""
Even a cursory review of the video shows no such thing. King did acknowledge Sessions’ presence at the event, along with the presence of seven other dignitaries. But she did not go any further than mentioning his name. By contrast, she specifically thanked a local community group and the hosting university for their help in making the museum a reality.
The website twists King’s actual words to a ridiculous degree, so we rate it Pants on Fire."

North Carolina’s state Republican party hasn’t won any leadership awards lately, but has controversially been the recipient of an outpouring of national support from Democrats who raised funds to repair their burnt out Orange County party offices. Now the NC GOP’s state spokesperson just admitted on NBC (still unchanged) that the Orange County party office actually held completed absentee ballots. If that’s true, then the NC GOP just admitted to a serious election felony. North Carolina election law says:
“§ 163-226.3. Certain acts declared felonies. (a) Any person who shall, in connection with absentee voting in any election held in this State, do any of the acts or things declared in this section to be unlawful, shall be guilty of a Class I felony. It shall be unlawful:
(6) For any person to take into that person’s possession for delivery to a voter or for return to a county board of elections the absentee ballot of any voter, provided, however, that this prohibition shall not apply to a voter’s near relative or the voter’s verifiable legal guardian[.]”
It didn’t take long for the internet to notice the irregularity of the statement. Speculation began on Fox entertainer Sean Hannity’s forum. The entire mess caught the attention of criminal defense lawyer and State Senate candidate T. Greg Doucette, who made this Facebook post. Then this tweet went viral and the rest as they say, it’s shameful history.

Nobody knows precisely what happened at the North Carolina’s Orange County offices yet, but investigators are looking into the fire. America’s free discourse demands that the perpetrators are brought to justice and the full story revealed quickly.
However, we do know that the North Carolina GOP just admitted a shocking ballot fraud, and any legitimate investigation must now seek to ensure the integrity of the rural county‘s electoral results.

It’s bad enough for Republicans that their presidential nominee is burning down their party, but if their state level party is caught engaging in open misconduct because of this omission, their already tenuous electoral hopes in the swing state may slip away entirely.

No matter who perpetrated the act, a message must be sent to that or those people that violence for political ends is never the right answer. Nor are dirty tricks by the Republican Party.

UPDATE II – 10/18/2016: Notably, Fox News used a chyron noting that “Absentee ballots burned in office attack” during their interview with the NC GOP’s chairperson, though he did not mention any absentee ballots in that interview, but rather sample ballots. You can watch the complete interview from Fox News below. This makes a second news outlet that noted Absentee Ballots being destroyed in the Orange County GOP office fire, but the broadcast doesn’t make it apparent why they chose that specific chyron."

","ThreatConnect is a group of researchers in Arlington, Virginia unraveling the source behind the hack of DNC emails that have shaken up the Democratic National Convention and voters everywhere. As the FBI continues their investigation into the hack, ThreatConnect says they’ve already uncovered a connection to Russian government.
According to ThreatConnect:
‘After further investigation, we can confirm that Guccifer 2.0 is using the Russia-based Elite VPN service to communicate and leak documents directly with the media. We reached this conclusion by analyzing the infrastructure associated with an email exchange with Guccifer 2.0 shared with ThreatConnect by Vocativ’s Senior Privacy and Security reporter Kevin Collier. This discovery strengthens our ongoing assessment that Guccifer 2.0 is a Russian propaganda effort and not an independent actor.’
The group Guccifer 2.0 is considered to be a group of bureaucrats and not sophisticated hackers. ThreatConnect believes that they may be part of a Russian propaganda arm designed to deflect attention away from political leaders in Russia and focus it elsewhere.
The news about ThreatConnect’s discoveries comes amidst new speculation about Donald Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns. He remains, at this point in the race, the only presidential nominee in modern history to refuse to release his returns during the race.
According to reports from The Wall Street Journal, most of the larger US banks won’t do business with Trump due to his history of failed businesses and bankruptcies, leaving him reliant on overseas funding for loans for new business ventures. When asked whether or not Trump has any outstanding debt to Russia, Trump’s press secretary would only say that Trump has no investments in Russia, an obvious deflection of the question.
The question is not whether Trump has invested money in Russia, but rather, has Russia invested money in Trump?
Even Fox News contributor and GOP lawyer, George Will, is beginning to question Trump’s link to Russian oligarchs as a result of his refusal to release his tax returns.
‘Well, it’s the sort of thing we might learn if we saw the candidate’s tax returns. Perhaps one more reason why we’re not seeing his tax returns — because he is deeply involved in dealing with Russian oligarchs and others. Whether that’s good, bad or indifferent, it’s probably the reasonable surmise.’
What was revealed in the hack of DNC emails is disturbing and cause for great concern, but if Donald Trump is receiving help with his campaign from Russian hackers willing to commit illegal acts to advance him in the race against Hillary Clinton, this should also be of grave concern to the presidential election voters.

","This scandal has a malign conspiracy, public lies, possible perjury, and an unrelenting assault not just on a core American institution enshrined in the Constitution but on democracy itself.
As you may have heard, the Trump administration has decided to add a question to the 2020 Census asking whether those answering are U.S. citizens. It’s already widely known that it’s hard enough already to get people, particularly in immigrant communities, to answer the questions, because there’s not only concern about privacy but also fear that the census will be used to target people for harassment or even deportation.
A citizenship question — which hasn’t been part of the decennial census for 70 years — is all but guaranteed to make people even more reluctant to answer the questions. That’s particularly true in the environment of fear that President Trump has created for all immigrants, both documented and undocumented, and indeed for all racial, religious and ethnic minorities.
AD
AD
That is, of course, the whole point. When communities with lots of immigrants and minorities are undercounted, that means fewer federal dollars will flow to them and they will be underrepresented in the redistricting that occurs after the census. The addition of the citizenship question is one more part of a broader Republican vote suppression effort that includes aggressive gerrymandering, voter ID laws, voter purges and restriction of early voting.
But like all those efforts, the administration’s decision to effectively turn the census into a tool to maintain Republican power has to be clothed in some kind of reasonable-sounding justification. It need not even be all that plausible; all that’s necessary is to give Republicans something they can say when Democrats point out what they’re doing. We have to pass voter ID because of the mythical epidemic of voter impersonation fraud. We have to purge the rolls because we care so deeply about efficient database management. And we have to ask about citizenship because the Trump administration needs complete information to enforce the Voting Rights Act and safeguard the rights of minorities.
That comical justification was what the administration, and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross in particular, offered to explain why it was so important to add the citizenship question (the census is under the authority of the Commerce Department). When they began raising the possibility, they said that the whole idea came from the Department of Justice, which made a request in December to the Commerce Department to add the question.
That, it has now become clear, was a lie. In fact, the Commerce Department asked the Justice Department to make the request, in what seems an obvious attempt to provide the cover story that they could use from that point forward. We know this because as part of a lawsuit filed by multiple states to stop the addition of the citizenship question, emails have been obtained that show Ross and other Commerce officials stating exactly what they were doing. Here’s part of The Post’s report, from Tara Bahrampour:
AD
AD
In a May 2, 2017, email to Earl Comstock, director of the department’s Office of Policy and Strategic Planning, Ross wrote: “I am mystified why nothing have [sic] been done in response to my months old request that we include the citizenship question. Why not?” Comstock responded the same day, promising to “get that in place” and adding, “We need to work with Justice to get them to request that citizenship be added back as a census question, and we have the court cases to illustrate that DOJ has a legitimate need for the question to be included.” This appears to contradict Ross’s testimony in March before the House Ways and Means Committee saying that the Justice Department had initiated the request for the question.
Indeed it does. On March 22, Ross testified before that committee when Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) asked him about the citizenship question. He began his response this way:
“The Department of Justice, as you know, initiated the request for inclusion of the citizenship question.”
With the release of these emails, we now know that was a part of the cover story that Ross and others in the administration concocted to argue falsely that the citizenship question would be added only to satisfy the Trump Justice Department’s deep concern for enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.
I doubt that Ross will be prosecuted for perjury, but it’s hard to see why he couldn’t be.
We also learn from an April 2017 email that “Steve Bannon has asked that the Secretary talk to someone about the Census,” which further undercuts the administration’s cover story that 1) this only came up because of the December 2017 Justice Department request, and 2) that it’s all about getting an accurate count to aid enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.
AD
AD
So here’s what we know:
Almost immediately after taking office, people in the Trump administration, including the president’s chief political strategist and the secretary of commerce, begin pushing to add the citizenship question.
Commerce officials decide to “work with Justice to get them to request that citizenship be added back as a census question.”
In September 2017, a Trump appointee at the Justice Department writes to officials at Commerce that “It sounds like we can do whatever you all need us to do,” adding that “the AG,” meaning Attorney General Jeff Sessions, “is eager to assist.”
The letter making the request finally gets written in December 2017, by a Trump appointee who spent much of his career defending Republican redistricting efforts.
The administration then publicly claims that the reason the citizenship question is being added is that the Justice Department has requested it so that the Voting Rights Act can be properly enforced and the rights of minorities safeguarded. In the statement released upon announcing the change on March 26, Ross claims that the request from the Department of Justice initiated the process, and after a careful review, “I have determined that reinstatement of a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census is necessary to provide complete and accurate data in response to the DOJ request.”
Ross also testifies under oath, falsely, that the entire process was initiated by the Justice Department.
On June 21, Ross puts out a new letter in which he changes his story, saying he had been considering the question for some time and, as part of the process, he “inquired whether the Department of Justice (DOJ) would support, and if so would request, inclusion of a citizenship question as consistent with and useful for enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.”
I’ll leave it up to you to decide whether that sounds like Ross knew, because of the multiple lawsuits that have been filed or for some other reason, that his lies were going to be exposed and he ought to get out in front of them."

","Update, 2/24/17: This Wednesday, President Trump revoked landmark protections that allowed transgender students to use the bathrooms they identify with, reversing work of the previous Obama administration that many celebrated as a victory for LGBT civil rights.
As reported by Reuters, last May then-President Barack Obama ordered schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms matching their preferred gender identity. Schools that did not comply risked having their funds withheld.
Read Reuters’ full report here.
Original story below:
As GOP lawmakers push their draconian anti-LGBT legislation across the South, the transgender community is now assuming the role of religious conservatives’ new favorite target, namely through what the Internet is calling “bathroom laws,” a tactic used to keep trans people from using the bathroom they associate with their gender identities.
But as Dan Avery of NewNowNext pointed out in late March, in all the entire history of the earth, more Republican lawmakers have been arrested for lewd conduct in bathrooms than trans people. Republicans – 3, (that we know of off-hand) trans people – 0.
“Obviously we need laws against senators using bathrooms, not trans people!” Avery writes.
To support the work we do on this site, click here.
Here are the three he dug up:
Jon Hinson
Hinson, a Mississippi congressman, was arrested in 1981 for having oral sex in the House of Representatives’ bathroom with a government staffer. In 1976, he was also arrested for exposing himself to an undercover agent but still managed to get himself reelected in 1980 after saying the incident was a result of his alcoholism. After the bathroom incident in 1981, he resigned from office.
Hinson came out as gay shortly after and lived out the rest of his life as an LGBT activist. He passed away from AIDS in 1995.
Larry Craig
Craig, an Idaho Republican senator, was arrested for lewd conduct in a men’s room at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in 2007. Craig’s claim that he simply had a “wide stance” after an undercover officer accused him of trying to initiate a sexual transaction between bathroom stalls was bandied about on headlines and late-night talk shows.
Craig pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of disorderly conduct, but two months later tried to withdraw the plea. even reversing his decision to resign from the Senate. Craig finished out his term and did not run for re-election in 2008.
Bob Allen
Around the same time as the Craig scandal, Florida state Representative Bob Allen was arrested for allegedly agreeing to pay $20 to perform a sex act an undercover cop in the bathroom at a public park. Although he resigned later that year, he maintained that the only reason he was in the bathroom was because he was hiding out from the scary African American men hanging around.
According to Avery, “It just goes to show that for Republican politicians, it’s better to be thought of as a racist than as wanting to suck another man’s d*ck.”
Another line of rationale that anti-LGBT politicians use to justify bathroom laws is the hypothetical notion that men might ‘pretend’ to be trans just to gain access to women’s bathrooms. A March 2014 piece from Media Matters shot that down handily, pointing out that no such cases exist.
“It’s a lie that is unsupported by even a shred of evidence and contradicted by years of experience in states that already have non-discrimination laws on the books.”

","Donald Trump lied to his Republican base and thought they were so stupid they would believe it, according to Jared Kushner.
Mr Kushner, a property developer who is both President Trump’s senior advisor and son-in-law, reportedly made the remarks after he was challenged about Mr Trump’s prolonged interrogation over whether Barack Obama was born in the US.
During Mr Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign and throughout his presidency, multiple theories emerged falsely claiming he was not a natural-born American US citizen and it was therefore unconstitutional for him to become US President. Mr Trump was among those who pushed the “birther” conspiracy theory and consistently questioned former President Obama’s birthplace of Hawaii.
✕ Donald Trump creates social media storm with 'covfefe' tweet
The former New York Observer editor has now claimed that Mr Kushner, the former publisher of the paper, informed her that Mr Trump did not believe the “birther” lies he was peddling.
“When I was the editor of the New York Observer, Kushner and I were going back and forth about how the paper should cover him,” Elizabeth Spiers wrote in a post on Twitter.
“I told Jared that I was particularly appalled by his father-in-law’s birtherism stance, which I viewed as cynical and racist.
“He rolled his eyes and said ‘He doesn’t really believe it, Elizabeth. He just knows Republicans are stupid and they’ll buy it’”.

Ms Spiers, who served as the editor of the publication from early 2011 to late 2012, made the alleged revelation in order to prove to a right-wing blogger that Mr Trump was a “notorious liar”.
“Let's be clear he was talking about you, Doug,” she says. “Trump did not con Democrats; he conned – and is still conning – his base. So you have every right to your gullibility and I won’t try to deprive you of it, but personally, I’d rather know what the hell is going on”.
Ms Spiers, who is also the founder of Gawker, also claimed that a friend of the mogul-turned-politico once told her Mr Trump would “lie to you about what time of day it is, just for the practice”.
But she is not the only person to argue that President Trump is a liar. It has been asserted by a number of politicians and commentators, with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders branding Mr Trump a “pathological liar”.
“What do you do when you have a President-elect, soon to be President, who – and I say this not happily but I think most people who observe him would agree – is a pathological liar who changes his mind every single day?” said Mr Sanders, who challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, at the end of last year."

","President Trump has been roundly criticized for skipping a veterans event in France over the weekend, and on Tuesday, a retired Army officer offered a particularly scathing assessment of the affair.
Barry McCaffrey, a retired four-star Army general who served as former President Bill Clinton's Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, told MSNBC's Brian Williams Tuesday that Trump skipping the event in France was ""insulting."" The president did so simply because he wanted to ""stay out of the rain, eat cheeseburgers, watch TV, and tweet angry denunciations of his many enemies,"" said McCaffrey, per Mediaite.
Trump was in France with other world leaders to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of the end of World War I, and he was scheduled to visit a cemetery where American soldiers are buried but canceled at the last minute. The White House at the time cited the rainy weather, saying it would not be safe to travel by helicopter, reports The New York Times. Trump days later threw the Secret Service under the bus, saying he wanted to travel to the event by car but they wouldn't let him.

","A majority of Americans say Donald Trump has not accomplished much during his first nine months in office and they have delivered a report card that is far harsher even than the tepid expectations they set for his tenure when he was sworn into office, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News survey.
Approaching the first anniversary of his victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, Mr Trump has an approval rating demonstrably lower than any previous chief executive at this point in his presidency over seven decades of polling. Fewer than 4 in 10 Americans — 37 per cent — say they approve of the way he is handling his job.
Mr Trump’s approval rating has changed little over the past four months, which have included tumultuous events, from hurricanes to legislative setbacks to indictments in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the role Russia played in the 2016 campaign.
The president’s disapproval rating has reached 59 per cent, with 50 per cent saying they strongly disapprove of the job he is doing. While little changed since the summer, both represent the worst marks of his presidency.
He is the only president dating back to Harry S Truman whose approval rating at this point in his presidency is net negative — by 22 points. The next worst recorded in that time was Bill Clinton, who had a net positive of 11 points by this time in his presidency.
✕ Donald Trump says 'Im the only one who matters'
Mr Trump began his presidency with only modest expectations on the part of a public that was divided coming out of last year’s contentious election. Roughly 100 days into his presidency, 42 per cent said he had accomplished a great deal or a good amount while in office. Today, that has declined to 35 per cent.
Meanwhile, 65 per cent say he has accomplished “not much” or “little or nothing.” This is up from 56 per cent last spring. Forty-three per cent of all Americans give him the lowest possible rating, saying he has accomplished “little or nothing.”

At the 100-day mark of Mr Trump’s presidency last spring, Americans were split almost evenly on the question of whether he was keeping most of his major campaign promises, with 44 per cent saying he was and 41 per cent disagreeing. Today the verdict is more severe, with a majority (55 per cent) saying he is not keeping most of those promises.
The public sees Democrats acting mostly as an opposition party, rather than offering ideas of their own. Asked whether the Democratic Party is presenting alternatives to Mr Trump’s proposals or mainly criticizing the president, 61 per cent said mainly criticizing, identical to the percentage who said this of Republican Party leaders one year after Obama’s election. Only a plurality of Democrats (47 per cent) say their leaders are offering alternatives to Mr Trump’s ideas.
Mr Trump’s actions and behaviour have drawn sharp criticism from a few members of his own party, most recently from Sensators Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona. Former president George W Bush delivered a recent speech that, while never mentioning Mr Trump by name, was seen as a rebuke of the way the president is conducting himself in office.

The Washington Post-ABC News poll asked self-identified Republicans and independents who lean toward the GOP whether they believed their party leaders should speak out when they disagree with the president. Overall, 71 per cent said they should, with just 27 per cent saying those leaders should avoid criticizing him, including 65 per cent of Trump voters who say Republicans should air their disagreements.
On four key issues, Mr Trump has not matched the early expectations for his presidency, and today, majorities — in some case strong majorities — give him negative reviews. Those issues are the economy, dealing with race relations, improving the health-care system and dealing with the threat of terrorism. (Part of this survey was conducted before the terrorist attack on Tuesday that left eight people dead in New York.)
The president has pointed to what he sees as significant accomplishments in the area of the economy, with the stock market at record levels, unemployment at 4.1 per cent — a 17-year low — and growth in the two most recent quarters at 3 per cent.
But the public gives him little credit for the state of the economy. Last January, 61 per cent offered a positive assessment when asked how they thought he would handle the economy. Today, 44 percent give him positive marks, while 53 per cent say he has not done well.

In January, a majority (56 per cent) said they believed he would do an excellent or good job dealing with threats of terrorism. Today, 43 per cent give him positive reviews.
Mr Trump receives even lower ratings on race and health care. Fewer than 3 in 10 say he has done a good job dealing with race relations, which is 12 points below the 40 per cent who said in January they thought he would handle race issues effectively. Half of all Americans say they believe Mr Trump is biased against black people and slightly more (55 percent) say he is biased against women.
The racial assessment follows a backlash to Mr Trump’s comments about the white supremacist rally in August in Charlottesville, where marchers chanted Nazi slogans and the ensuing violence left one woman dead and others injured. Two state police officers also died when their helicopter crashed after assisting in the unrest. Mr Trump was slow to condemn the marchers and at one point said there were “very fine people” among the neo-Nazi demonstrators.
In January, 44 per cent said they expected him to handle the issue of health care effectively, including 87 per cent of Republicans. Optimism has faded sharply, with 26 per cent of Americans and 59 per cent of Republicans giving him positive marks today. The overall percentage offering a negative assessment has jumped from 51 per cent in January to 70 per cent today, including 47 per cent who give him the lowest rating, “poor.”

Political independents have soured the most considering Mr Trump’s pre-inaugural expectations and current ratings. The percentage of independents saying Mr Trump is doing a good job on the economy, race relations and health care is more than 20 points lower than the percentage that expected him to perform well in January. On terrorism, today’s ratings are 17 points below early expectations among independents.
Congressional Republicans were stymied in their efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, despite years of promises to do so. The House, after first failing to pass a bill, eventually approved a measure and sent it to the Senate. Senate Republican leaders struggled to get a health bill to the floor for consideration. When they did, they fell short of the necessary majority needed to keep the process moving.
Throughout that process, Mr Trump prodded the Republican leadership, principally Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, with demeaning tweets demanding action. Ever since the effort broke down, Mr Trump has attempted to focus the ire of disappointed conservatives on those congressional Republicans, but the failed effort also appears to have taken a toll on him.
A solid majority (59 per cent) also see Mr Trump as trying to make the federal health law fail. Less than one-tenth of the public says they support those efforts to scuttle the law through executive actions, while overall, 50 per cent of the public opposes what they see as Mr Trump undermining the existing program.
As tensions mount over North Korea’s pursuit of a nuclear weapon and delivery system capable of hitting the United States, the public has little trust in the president to handle the problem responsibly. A majority (51 per cent) say they trust him “not at all” on this national security issue and 16 per cent say they trust him “just some.” Meanwhile, 32 per cent say they trust him “a great deal” or “a good amount.”

Other measures highlight the degree to which Mr Trump is governing with the support of a minority of the population. Four in 10 say he is a strong leader. That’s 13 points below the level in April. On this question, he has gone from a net positive of eight points to a net negative of 19 points. Roughly twice as many Americans say that under Mr Trump, US leadership in the world has gotten weaker rather than stronger, 53 to 26 per cent.
Mr Trump campaigned on his dealmaking ability, but the public doubts his ability to forge political agreements. Almost 6 in 10 say he is not good at making political deals while under 4 in 10 say he is good at making deals.
One-third say he is honest and trustworthy, down only marginally since April. On the question of whether he has the temperament and personality needed to serve as president, 31 per cent say yes, while 66 per cent say no. That is the lowest since August 2016, when Mr Trump was embroiled in a controversy with a Gold Star family.
A minority of 37 per cent say he understands the problems “of people like you,” unchanged since last spring, while 42 per cent say he has brought needed change to Washington, marginally better than when last measured two months ago.
Of those Americans who say they voted in 2016, 46 per cent say they supported Clinton, and 43 per cent say they backed Mr Trump. If an election were held today, with the same candidates, 40 per cent of those 2016 voters say they would back Mr Trump, and 40 per cent say they would support Ms Clinton.
Mr Trump has succeeded in satisfying voters who elected him president but few others. Voters who supported Mr Trump continue to be overwhelmingly supportive, with 91 per cent approving of his performance, including 69 per cent “strongly.” A still larger 95 per cent of Clinton voters disapprove of him, with 88 per cent who feel that way strongly. Among those who supported neither candidate — or did not vote — 24 per cent approve of Mr Trump while 68 per cent disapprove.

","“ They should be LYNCHED !” Oliver wrote in comments posted on his Facebook page.
On Saturday, state Rep. Karl Oliver (R) had described the “destruction” of Confederate monuments in Louisiana as “heinous and horrific” and compared leaders in that state to Nazis.
After condemnation from members of his own party, a Republican member of the Mississippi House of Representatives apologized Monday for calling for the lynching of anyone who removes a Confederate monument, including lawmakers in a neighboring state.
The message drew “likes” from two of Oliver’s fellow Republican lawmakers, state Rep. John Read and state Rep. Doug McLeod, the Jackson Free Press reported.
Oliver’s post came a day after a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was removed in New Orleans. It was the city’s fourth Confederate memorial to be dismantled in recent days.
On Monday, following press scrutiny and criticism from members of his own party, Oliver removed the post and issued a statement apologizing for his remarks:
I, first and foremost, wish to extend this apology for any embarrassment I have caused to both my colleagues and fellow Mississippians. In an effort to express my passion for preserving all historical monuments, I acknowledge the word “lynched” was wrong. I am very sorry. It is in no way, ever, an appropriate term. I deeply regret that I chose this word, and I do not condone the actions I referenced, nor do I believe them in my heart. I freely admit my choice of words was horribly wrong, and I humbly ask your forgiveness.
The state’s Republican leaders, including Gov. Phil Bryant, condemned Oliver’s remarks, and the state GOP distanced itself from them, according to Mississippi Today.
“Rep. Oliver’s comments were offensive, do not represent the Mississippi Republican Party and have no place in our public discourse,” Mississippi Republican Party Chairman Joe Nosef said in a statement. “I hope he will quickly clear up his remarks to make his point without these inappropriate comments.”
Democrats in the state blasted Oliver’s call for the violent killing of people he disagrees with.
“I am offended and outraged that a public official in 2017 would, with an obvious conviction and clear conscience, call for and promote one of the most cruel, vicious and wicked acts in American history,” Mississippi state Sen. Derrick Simmons, a Democrat, told The Root."

","President Donald Trump supporters protesting the outcome of the 2020 election have a new and surprising opponent: the Republican Party.
A viral video of protesters, as well as posts on social media platform Parler, indicate that Trump supporters are looking to boycott the upcoming Georgia Senate runoff elections.
Trump supporters in Georgia vow to destroy the Republican Party if Trump doesn't win pic.twitter.com/04dPRQFfC0 — Fifty Shades of Whey (@davenewworld_2) November 21, 2020
A video, shared on Twitter on Saturday, shows a protester speaking into a mic criticizing Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and Utah Senator Mitt Romney, who are both Republicans. The protester calls them ""traitors.""
Seemingly reacting to certification from Georgia election officials that President-elect Joe Biden had indeed won the Peach State following an election recount, the protesters disavowed the GOP.
""Any Republican who allows this to happen is complicit, and we will finish you,"" the protester, donning a camo sweatshirt with an elephant on it, shouts into the microphone. ""For any Republicans not explicitly helping Trump to 'stop the steal,' we will make sure you are never elected ever again.""
Another demonstrator can be heard shouting a long ""We're the new GOP.""
Reading remarks off his phone, the protester in the camo vows to dismantle the party.
""If the Republican establishment stands back and stands by and allows the steal to go through, we will do whatever it takes to completely destroy the Republican Party,"" he said. ""We will accept nothing less than a Donald Trump victory."" He also accused recounts and ballots of being ""fake""—yet claims about voter fraud have been widely debunked.
While in-person protests urged officials to call the election for Trump, a number of Republicans on the ""free-speech"" social media website Parler have demanded a boycott of the Senate runoff elections, citing a conspiracy theory about ""rigged"" voting machines. Screenshots shared by reporter Marcus Baram showed that people on the app accused Kemp and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of being ""RINOs""—an acronym for ""Republican in Name Only""—and trying to lead to victories for Democratic candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff. Both Warnock and Ossoff are challenging incumbent Republican Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, respectively.
Many of the posts bore a resemblance to language used by people who believe the QAnon conspiracy theory.
""DO NOT VOTE IN THE GEORGIA RUNOFFS, THE DEEP STATE WILL BE COLLECTING EVERYONE'S INFO. THIS IS A CHARADE, MEANT TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO DON'T VOTE DEMOCRAT,"" one post read, which also lamented that potential victories for Warnock and Ossoff were a ""small price to pay.""

The Georgia runoff election is scheduled for January 5, with early voting beginning on December 14. The runoffs will determine which party controls the Senate.
Other than the Republican Party, many supporters have also turned on Fox News, upset that the network has also called the election for President-elect Joe Biden. Another video of protests shows one person saying that Fox ""betrayed us"" in calling Arizona for Biden.
""After Fox News called Arizona prematurely for Joe Biden, I said, 'I will never watch Fox News again,'"" the protester said.

","Brett Kavanaugh's Yale University classmate ripped into the Supreme Court nominee for ""blatantly lying"" during his Senate Judiciary hearing yesterday.
After Kavanaugh spoke at the hearing on Thursday, Lynne Brookes, a self-identified Republican who said she was the roommate of Deborah Ramirez, the second Kavanaugh accuser who claimed the judge once exposed his genitals to her at a dormitory party, told Chris Cuomo on CNN that she and some of her fellow Yale colleagues were ""extremely disappointed in Kavanaugh's characterization of himself and the way he evaded his excessive drinking questions.
""There is no doubt in my mind that while at Yale he was a big partier, often drank to excess,"" she said.
""And there had to be a number of nights where he does not remember. In fact, I was witness to the night that he got tapped into that fraternity, and he was stumbling drunk in a ridiculous costume saying really dumb things. And I can almost guarantee that there's no way that he remembers that night.
""There were a lot of emails and a lot of texts flying around about how he was lying to the Senate Judiciary Committee today,"" Brookes continued.
Brookes also told Cuomo that she had drank to ""excess many nights with Brett Kavanaugh"" and spoke about a particular incident in which the Supreme Court nominee and a friend allegedly barged into a room ""where a guy and girl had gone off together and embarrassed that woman.""
""They thought it was funny. The girl was mortified,"" she said, before accusing Kavanaugh of ""blatant lying.""
During the hearing on Thursday, Kavanaugh vehemently denied claims made by Christine Blasey Ford in her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had sexually assaulted her when the two were high school students more than three decades ago.
""This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons,"" Kavanaugh said in his opening statement.
The judge also denounced the senators on the committee, saying they had turned the hearing into a ""national disgrace."" Kavanaugh then turned on the Democrats who he claimed had been ""in a frenzy"" since Trump nominated him for the Supreme Court in July.
Ford has taken a polygraph test, and the results showed the probability of deception was 0.02. Kavanaugh has yet to take a polygraph.
""You may defeat me in the final vote,"" he said during the hearing. ""But you will never get me to quit, never."""

","Wikipedia editors voted to ban Breitbart as a source of fact in it articles. The consensus, reached late last month, agreed that the outlet “should not be used, ever, as a reference for facts, due to its unreliability.” Wikipedia editors also decided that InfoWars is a “conspiracy theorist and fake news website,” and that the “use of InfoWars as a reference should be generally prohibited.
Breitbart, a far-right conservative media website, has come under scrutiny—such as when it vehemently supported Alabama politician and alleged pedophile Roy Moore, when it shilled for scam cryptocurrencies through its newsletter, or when it fueled racist narratives about black NFL players. Wikipedians decided that because fact checkers have found much of Breitbart’s coverage to be “misleading, false or both,” they won’t abide it as a source of fact anymore.

“We have something over 2,500 links to Breitbart, many of them as sources in articles,” the editor who nominated the rule wrote in the vote. “I think that Breitbart is not a reliable source […] It's my view that we should not source anything to Breitbart other than strictly factual and uncontroversial facts about Breitbart on the articles related to Breitbart and its people.”
The ensuing discussion about whether Breitbart should be considered a factual source went on for dozens of comments, many of them impassioned. But, overwhelmingly, editors believed it should be banned except when used as a source to attribute opinions or relevant commentary. It has been “deprecated” for English articles, and will no longer be used as a reliable source for facts on the English version of the online encyclopedia.
“There is a very clear consensus here that yes, Breitbart should be deprecated in the same way as the Daily Mail,” Wikipedian Fish+Karate, a Wikipedia administrator, wrote in a post announcing the change.

“Longstanding reputation for publishing utter falsehoods, fabrications and blatant distortions about living people it opposes, and having no meaningful fact-checking structure in place whatsoever,” another editor wrote about Breitbart. “Completely inappropriate for Wikipedia.”
In February 2017, Wikipedians made a similar call for Daily Mail citations—that the publication would no longer be cited in articles as fact, due to its “reputation for poor fact checking, sensationalism and flat-out fabrication.” In April, when Facebook started marking fake news stories as fake with a popup linking to Wikipedia as a fact-checking reference, Breitbart claimed that Wikipedia “is notorious for its bias, editorial unaccountability, and unreliable articles.” In fact, Wikipedia is incredibly stringent about fake news and its editors are obsessive about accuracy (that doesn’t mean Wikipedia is always correct, but mistakes are generally fixed quickly.) In addition to Facebook, YouTube is also relying on the work of volunteer Wikipedia editors to fact-check its conspiracy theory videos.

Last week, Wikipedia editors held a similar vote for Occupy Democrats, a progressive website. As it’s a political activist movement outlet, and not a reliable news source, it can’t be cited on Wikipedia as fact.
They also started a discussion for InfoWars’ reliability, but the vote was closed, citing the “Snowball Clause,” that no sane editor would cite InfoWars in the first place (giving it a “snowball’s chance in hell” that it’d be used and left up on the site except in exceptional cases.) In any case, InfoWars is also generally banned from being a source on the site.
Wikipedia currently classified InfoWars as a “conspiracy theorist and fake news website. It is a generally unreliable source. The use of InfoWars as a reference should be generally prohibited, especially when other more reliable sources exist. InfoWars should not be used for determining notability, or used as a secondary source in articles.” InfoWars is also on the Wikimedia global spam blacklist.

Soon after Breitbart was banned, Wikipedia editors began making a master list of all Breitbart citations on the site that are opinion-related, so that those could be protected and other instances of Breitbart serving as a source of facts could get deleted.
“Every second spent removing content which can only be sourced to Breitbart is well spent,” one editor wrote in support of the new rule."

The official said four websites that U.S. intelligence has marked as fronts for Russian intelligence have exaggerated the risk of side effects associated with the Pfizer shot and other Western vaccines and falsely questioned their efficacy and speed of their approval process. The sites don't have large readership numbers, but officials are reportedly concerned they could be amplified.
Pfizer is likely the main target because it was the first vaccine besides Russia's own Sputnik V to see widespread, global use, the Journal reports. An upcoming report from the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a German Marshall Fund-affiliated NGO which focuses on authoritarian governments, reportedly says Russia likely views Pfizer as a threat to ""Sputnik's market dominance""
A spokesman for the Kremlin denied that Moscow was orchestrating a campaign against any vaccine, arguing that if Russia were to treat ""every negative publication"" about the Sputnik jab ""as a result of efforts by American special services, then we will go crazy because we see it every day, every hour, and in every Anglo-Saxon media.""

","Domestic Terrorist: Rep. Lauren Boebert, a newly elected member of congress and a big QAnon supporter, is facing calls for her arrest after live-tweeting Nancy Pelosi’s location to terrorists as they stormed the U.S. Capitol earlier this week.
Raw Story reports:
Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), a gun-toting supporter of the QAnon movement, is facing backlash after she was accused of live-tweeting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) location during the attack on Capitol Hill last week.
As Trump supporters were storming the Capitol, Boebert warned the terrorists that Pelosi had been moved, tweeting:
The Speaker has been removed from the chambers. — Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) January 6, 2021
The Speaker has been removed from the chambers.
Before tweeting that Pelosi had moved, she had tweeted:
We were locked in the House Chambers.
In addition, Boebert tweeted encouragement to the domestic terrorists before the assault, declaring:
Today is 1776. — Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) January 6, 2021
Today is 1776
As one might imagine, many are calling for Boebert’s arrest and removal from congress. The following is a sample of reactions to Boebert’s deplorable behavior:

","TOPLINE
Postal workers in Washington State have reinstalled high-speed mail sorting machines—dismantled after controversial orders from the U.S. Postal Service— despite USPS orders not to put machines back in use.

[+] Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on U.S. Postal Service operations during Covid-19 pandemic August 21, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Photo by U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee via Getty Images)
KEY FACTS
After embattled Postmaster General Louis DeJoy announced he would pause recent controversial changes to U.S. Postal Service protocol, the service told workers not to reinstall removed equipment. 40 percent of the high-speed mail sorting machines in the Seattle-Tacoma area were disconnected or dismantled since the changes went into effect, according to KUOW Public Radio in Seattle, with workers in the Tacoma, Washington sorting plant saying eight of their 18 machines that sort and postmark letters were disconnected and pushed into a corner. A sorting machine in Wenatchee, Washington was also reconnected, against the orders of the Postal Service’s head of maintenance, Kevin Couch. Only two facilities, Seattle-Tacoma and one in Dallas, seem to be ignoring the Postal Service’s directive to leave decommissioned sorting machines out of use.
Key Background
Since being appointed postmaster general in May, Louis DeJoy, a prolific GOP fundraiser and Trump donor, has enacted highly controversial changes to U.S. Postal Service protocol that workers say resulted in massive delays in mail delivery, including cutting overtime for postal workers, the nationwide removal of mail collection boxes and decommissioning or dismantling of hundreds of high speed mail sorting machines across the country. The changes have led to widespread fear that the Postal Service won’t be equipped to handle the millions of mail-in ballots expected during the November election. Democrats on the state and national level have filed lawsuits against DeJoy, the USPS, and President Donald Trump arguing that the changes are an effort to curb mail-in voting during the November election. DeJoy testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Friday and is expected to testify before the House Oversight Committee on Monday.

","GOP campaigners have called on senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley to resign through billboards that condemn them for supporting claims the 2020 election was “stolen”.
The billboard campaign, which launched on Thursday, targets 10 other Republicans who also rejected Joe Biden’s presidential election win when Congress voted on 6 January – hours after they came under attack by Donald Trump’s supporters with claims the election was “rigged”.
About $1 million (£729,000) has been spent on the billboard campaign, Politico reported, which has been set-up by the Republican Accountability Project (RAP), a group of former GOP officials who formed together in the days after the Capitol riot.
RAP has already committed to spend $50 million (£36 million) supporting GOP members of Congress who voted to impeach Mr Trump on 13 January, as well as senators who vote to convict him for “incitement of insurrection”.
That vote will follow a second impeachment trial in the Senate, which is set to begin on 8 February despite recent calls by Mr Cruz to “move on”.
One billboard by RAP says that Mr Cruz ""lied about the election. The Capitol was attacked. Sen. Cruz: Resign.” It is due to appear in his Texas constituency, with billboards also planned in major US cities.
Other Republicans targeted by the campaign include the House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, who met with Mr Trump in recent days, as well as a number of House Republicans who voted against the election results and Mr Trump’s impeachment.

Sarah Longwell, executive director of the Republican Accountability Project, told Politico that those targeted by the billboards are “people who are the most enthusiastic about lying to their constituencies about the election being stolen”.
“The goal is to not allow these officials to memory-hole the fact that they pushed this lie, which incited the attack on the Capitol,” said Ms Longwell.
“It took a lot of players within the Republican party to convince the vast majority of their voters that the election was fraudulent,” she added."

","The U.S. government's response to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak has been ""much, much worse than almost any other country that's been affected,"" Ashish Jha, who runs the Harvard Global Health Institute, told NPR on Thursday. ""I still don't understand why we don't have extensive testing. Vietnam! Vietnam has tested more people than America has."" Without testing, he added, ""you have no idea how extensive the infection is,"" and ""we have to shut schools, events, and everything down, because that's the only tool available to us until we get testing back up. It's been stunning to me how bad the federal response has been.""
There are a lot of reasons why the U.S. lags other countries in testing for the new coronavirus — defective early tests by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the decision not to adopt an effective German test adopted by the World Health Organization — but Politico's Dan Diamond told Fresh Air's Terry Gross on Thursday that politics also seems to have played a role, along with mismanagement and infighting between, for example, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Seema Verma, the Medicare chief.
In January, Azar ""did push past resistance from the president's political aides to warn the president the new coronavirus could be a major problem,"" Diamond said, but he ""has not always given the president the worst-case scenario of what could happen. My understanding is [Trump] did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that's partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear — the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential re-election this fall."""

","With Democrats now in control of the U.S. House of Representatives, several members of House-led committees are preparing to challenge Department of Education Secretary Besty DeVos on several policies.
POLITICO reports that at least five committees could take DeVos to task next year on some of the more controversial policies enforced by the Dept. of Education.
Among them will be the House education committee where Virginia Democrat Bobby Scott is expected to be named chairman. Scott has been vocal about many of the policies enforced by DeVos, including the secretary's rollback of sexual assault policies on college campuses.
""The proposed rule creates a new process and evidentiary standard that makes it harder for survivors of harassment, abuse, and assault to achieve the justice they deserve,"" Scott said in a statement after reports of DeVos' policy plans surface. ""Campus sexual misconduct is already underreported and those who do come forward are too often denied respect, compassion, and a fair investigation of their claim.""
Another opponent, expected to lead the Veterans' Affairs Committee, will be Rep. Mark Takano.
The California Democrat told POLITICO he plans to investigate the effects the reduction of regulations meant to stop misuse of funds from for-profit colleges. Those colleges, Takano said, enroll thousands of veterans each year.
A House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees education funding is expected to be led by Rep. Rosa DeLauro, who told Politico that DeVos' record on student debt was ""appalling.""
According to DeLauro, the committee will, ""hold Secretary DeVos accountable for her agency's failure to uphold federal protections for our students.""
Rep. Maxine Waters, known for her public spats with President Donald Trump, could be an ally for DeLauro as she is believed to be the future chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee.
Waters has publicly condemned DeVos' policies, saying earlier in November that the Education secretary is conducting a ""full-on attack on civil rights protections for students — particularly students of color, students with disabilities, transgender students, and survivors of sexual assault.""
Waters told POLITICO that her position will largely spotlight big banks and Wall Street, but the Financial Services Committee also oversees student loan companies and the Consumer Protection Bureau.
DeVos has no love lost with members of the CPB, either. The bureau's top student loan officer, Seth Frotman, resigned in August as a form of protest against policies enacted by DeVos and the Trump Administration.
""Betsy DeVos has brought a special mix of incompetence and malevolence to Washington — and that's rocket fuel for every committee in a new Congress that will finally provide oversight,"" Frotman said."

","Six families sued Alex Jones and InfoWars for defamation, among other claims.
Six families of victims killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School won a legal victory Friday in their fight against controversial radio and internet personality Alex Jones.
A judge in Connecticut has granted the families’ discovery requests, allowing them access to, among other things, Infowars’ internal marketing and financial documents.
The judge has scheduled a hearing next week to decide whether to allow the plaintiffs’ attorneys to depose Jones.
The plaintiffs include the parents of five children who went to the school as well as family members of first-grade teacher Victoria Leigh Soto and Principal Dawn Hochsprung, according to a statement from the plaintiff's attorneys.
According to the statement, the plaintiffs allege a ""years-long campaign of abusive and outrageous false statements in which Jones and the other defendants have developed, amplified and perpetuated claims that the Sandy Hook massacre was staged and that the 26 families who lost loved ones that day are paid actors who faked their relative's deaths.""
It goes on to say that ""Jones' actions subjected the families and survivors of the Sandy Hook shooting to physical confrontations and harassment, death threats and personal attacks on social media.""
""From the beginning, we have alleged that Alex Jones and his financial network trafficked in lies and hate in order to profit from the grief of Sandy Hook families. That is what we intend to prove, and today's ruling advances that effort,"" Chris Mattei, one of the attorneys representing the families, said in the statement. ""We look forward to gaining access to Infowars' internal marketing and financial documents to show that Jones has built an empire as nothing more than a conspiracy profiteer, as alleged in our complaint.""
Jones has sought to dismiss the lawsuit.
""Plaintiffs suffered a horrible tragedy,"" his defense attorney, Jay M. Wolman, wrote in a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. ""Alex Jones and Infowars are not responsible for this tragedy. To punish them for First Amendment protected speech on this matter of public concern will not bring back the lives lost.""
Wolman did not immediately respond to ABC News' requests for comment.
The judge’s ruling on discovery gives the plaintiffs access to any communication Jones had about the Newtown massacre and to documents that could point to the inner workings of Infowars."

This is the highest number on record with more than two months left in the year, and the vast majority are Black and Brown transgender women. It’s unacceptable.

These deaths don’t exist within a vacuum. Dehumanizing government actions and rhetoric as well as a failure to address risk factors like domestic and intimate partner violence, underemployment and unemployment and poverty, housing insecurity and health disparities, put this community at risk.
From banning transgender patriots from serving their country, to attempting to limit transgender people’s access to health care in the midst of a pandemic, to literally erasing the word transgender from government websites, President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have fueled the flames of transphobia in our nation while refusing to acknowledge the epidemic of violence.
Solving this epidemic of violence doesn’t just require a President who actually recognizes it as fact, but one who believes in the humanity and dignity of transgender people.
As President, I will put forward comprehensive solutions to help empower the transgender and gender non-conforming community and prioritize the prosecution of anti-transgender violence. My administration will enact the Equality Act to end legal discrimination against LGBTQ+ people, expand economic opportunities for LGBTQ+ people, reform our treatment of transgender and gender non-conforming individuals in our criminal justice system, ensure access to accurate identification documents, and improve government data collection to better track violence against the transgender community.

","House Democrats launched a sweeping new Russia investigation Wednesday with the promise to dig deep into President Trump’s family and their money.
The new probe takes aim at Trump’s business, and it will investigate whether any of his administration’s decisions have been influenced by financial incentives dangled by foreign actors.
California Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, acknowledged the ongoing investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller while announcing the new congressional probe.

“[T]he Committee must fulfill its responsibility to provide the American people with a comprehensive accounting of what happened, and what the United States must do to protect itself from future interference and malign influence operations,” Schiff wrote in a statement Wednesday.
The investigation will have 5 vectors:
Russian attempts to influence U.S. politics
Links between Russia and Trump’s team
“Whether any foreign actor has sought to compromise or holds leverage, financial or otherwise, over Donald Trump, his family, his business, or his associates”
Whether Trump and his inner circle have ever been vulnerable to foreign exploitation, or tried to steer U.S. government policy to benefit foreign interests
Whether anyone has tried to obstruct investigations, including those run by Congress
The revival of the Russia probe is the second major act from the House Intelligence Committee under Democratic leadership, and comes the same day that they voted to send key transcripts to Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
“As its first act, the Committee has voted to release to the Department of Justice and its components, including the Special Counsel’s Office, transcripts of testimony taken before the Committee during the 115th Congress, with no restrictions on their use,” Schiff said in a statement Wednesday.
The flurry of activity Wednesday marks the real-world consequences of November’s midterm elections, in which Democrats took back control of the House of Representatives. Having reclaimed control of House committees, Democrats can now investigate Trump’s White House and business empire — equipped with subpoena power.
Democratic leaders have already threatened to use that power to demand key members of Trump’s orbit testify before Congress, including Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen and Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, who is scheduled to appear on Capitol Hill on Friday.

A previous Russia investigation in the House Intelligence Committee was closed by Republican leadership last March, amid partisan squabbling over whether its work was really finished. The committee’s GOP majority released a final report concluding there was no evidence Trump colluded with Russian efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election. Democrats in the minority published their own take, arguing that many potential leads were never followed up on.
Now, Schiff is signaling that the committee is about to take a deep look at whether Trump may be awash in dirty Russian money.
“During the prior Congress, the Committee began to pursue credible reports of money laundering and financial compromise related to the business interests of President Trump, his family, and his associates,” Schiff said in a statement.
“The President’s actions and posture towards Russia during the campaign, transition, and administration have only heightened fears of foreign financial or other leverage over President Trump and underscore the need to determine whether he or those in his administration have acted in service of foreign interests since taking office,” he said."

","President Donald Trump is facing major problems attracting senior voters he won in 2016, particularly women over age 65, allowing former Vice President Joe Biden to expand his lead in the battleground states of Florida, Pennsylvania and even North Carolina.
A new poll released Thursday evening finds Trump has been unable to close the gap with Biden in several key swing states he won in the 2016 presidential election, due in large part to his failure to win over seniors and Latinos. The latest Hill/Harris battleground poll shows Biden leading Trump 51 to 46 percent in Pennsylvania, 50 to 47 percent in Florida and eking out a slight advantage over Trump in North Carolina. Coronavirus pandemic concerns among elderly women and a failure to attract more Hispanic residents in the South were cited as major factors behind Trump's lagging numbers just days before the November 3 election.
In 2016, Trump enjoyed a significant 9-point advantage nationally over Hillary Clinton among seniors over age 65, 53 to 44 percent—a lead he has since lost primarily among older women.
Biden is holding a steady 10-point lead over Trump among Latinos across all three states, 52 percent to 42 percent, according to this newest survey.
""In Florida, Trump has a strong Latino vote for a Republican but has problems with senior women concerned about the [coronavirus],"" said The Hill pollster and political strategist, Mark Penn. ""Joe Biden's position in key swing states going into the final week suggests that Trump has so far been unable to generate enough momentum to close the gap.""
The Biden campaign is pressing hard to maintain a lead among Florida Latino voters while simultaneously picking off 2016 senior voters—particularly women—who voted for Trump four years ago. Biden told a crowd in Tampa Thursday that he will ""shut the virus down"" as both he and former President Barack Obama have been on a campaign blitz across the state ridiculing the Trump administration's pandemic response.
A majority of Florida voters, 55 percent, say Biden will do a better job of handling the COVID-19 pandemic than Trump, who 45 percent said the same of in the poll conducted among 1,148 likely Florida voters this week. The Biden campaign has put forward aggressive campaigning in Pennsylvania and North Carolina suburbs, although Trump maintains very strong support among rural voters in all three states.
Trump won North Carolina by about 3.5 percentage points, or fewer than 200,000 votes, in the 2016 presidential contest with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
The overwhelming majority of polls released over the past few weeks show Trump trailing in key Midwest and battleground states he narrowly won four years ago—potentially dooming his campaign should these numbers not turn around with five days left until Election Day.
A separate SurveyMonkey and Axios survey released Thursday showed Biden is 9 points ahead of Trump in Michigan and the Democratic nominee leads Trump by 12 percentage points in the neighboring Midwest states of Minnesota and Wisconsin.
Although Biden may be expanding his support among older U.S. voters in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida, two of those states are seeing unprecedented levels of voting from the youngest Americans. North Carolina last week joined Florida and Texas in leading the country for the most youth ballots cast in early voting as of last week.
""This is really a must-win state for Trump. Biden can lose this state and still be OK,"" Andy Jackson of the conservative Civitas Institute told Fox News Thursday of North Carolina's importance in the 2020 election. ""The Trump campaign has been putting more effort here because they have to.""

A former Border Patrol officer said there is no excuse for current officers not to lay down their weapons and refuse to detain children separated from their parents. Jenn Budd, 47, was with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection from 1995 to 2001 as a senior patrol officer. Based in Campo, California, Budd was tasked with patrolling the border and assisting in the deportation of immigrants. She ultimately left because of what she described as a culture of sexual harassment against women but said she took gratification in the job itself. “I’ve had a lot of negative things to say about the Border Patrol, but I also recognize that we have to protect our borders and I had some pride in that,” Budd told HuffPost. But what she’s seeing now has sickened her, she said. In a facility in Texas, nearly 1,500 children are being held captive with no access to their parents. White House officials continue to lie about the reason for the detainments, saying they are just following a law ― except no law ordering immigrant families to be separated exists. And in her defense of the treatment, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that “it is very biblical to enforce the law.”
There’s going to be kids that end up committing suicide, whether in custody or afterward, because of the trauma we’re putting them through. Jenn Budd, former Border Patrol agent
On Monday, ProPublica published audio of detained children crying and begging for their parents. In it, an agent can be heard saying, “Well, we have an orchestra here” over the sounds of sobbing. “I honestly was just so ashamed that I ever belonged to this organization,” Budd said about hearing the audio. “It’s unlawful to take children away from their parents like this. It’s unheard of.” At a press briefing Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen argued that some children are separated when they are not able to provide proof that the adults they are with are, in fact, their parents. She said if they can’t provide proof of the relationship, it could be a case of human trafficking. Budd said that’s a lie. “They’re not crossing over with birth certificates and even if they did, immigration officials might not believe those documents, they’ll say they’re fake,” she said. “It’s very rare that anybody ever crosses the border with somebody else’s child. Kids are usually with an aunt or relative or something like that. [The administration] is misleading people and flat-out lying.”

","Mere days before his 2016 election to the presidency, Donald Trump boldly promised his voters: “When we win on November 8th and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.”
Now Trump is on his way out of the White House, and the health care law is still standing.
Trump, who had promised on the campaign trail to deliver “great health care at a tiny fraction of the cost — and it’s going to be so easy,” quickly realized how wrong he was. Republican congressional attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act consumed most of Trump’s first year in office. They wanted to deliver on a years-long obsession with undoing the previous president’s signature legislative achievement.
The repeal push ultimately failed with Sen. John McCain’s thumbs-down in July 2017. Though Republicans said they would make a second attempt that fall, it quickly sputtered and never came up for a vote.
Trump and Republicans failed to figure how to satisfy the outsized promises they had made. Rather than make health insurance more affordable, their plans would have shrunk federal assistance and hiked premiums for millions. Rather than cover everybody, as Trump said he wanted to do, millions of people would have lost their insurance. Rather than protect Medicaid, as the president pledged he would, their proposals would have cut hundreds of billions of dollars in spending and led to millions falling off its rolls. People with preexisting conditions would have lost the iron-clad protections that Obamacare had given them, that they would not be denied coverage or charged a higher premium because of their medical history.
“Nobody knew health care could be so complicated,” Trump said just one month into his term.
The Trump White House paid the price for its miscalculation. Democrats, campaigning heavily on preserving health care, won back the House in the 2018 midterms. The GOP’s Senate majority was lost in 2020. Biden pummeled Trump over his health care agenda and made the latter a one-term president.
Not every president passes a landmark health care bill, as Barack Obama did. But Republicans swept into power four years ago having promised to fix what they said Obama had broken. Trump said he would not only repeal and replace Obamacare, but he’d put into place ambitious plans to bring down drug prices.
The Covid-19 pandemic response was a disaster, with 400,000 Americans now dead, and the repercussions will be felt for years. That will be Trump’s legacy more than any affirmative steps his administration took to change US health care. As Trump surrenders power, what’s remarkable is how little of a mark he will leave on American health care.
“We spent four years waiting to see Trump’s health care plan, which may or may not have ever existed,” Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. “His promise of ‘great’ health care was certainly never realized.”
The denouement to Trump’s failed health care record should come later this year when the US Supreme Court, of which he’s appointed a third of the members, is expected to reject the latest challenge to the ACA — a lawsuit that the Trump administration had supported.
Biden begins his term looking to quickly build on the ACA, expanding the welfare state that the outgoing president tried so hard but failed to shrink. There are still serious problems in US health care: tens of millions still uninsured and medical care left unaffordable for many others who do have an insurance card. But Biden will pick up where Obama left off, almost as if the Trump administration never happened.
Why Trump failed to change US health care
Legislation is the surest way to change US public policy for good, and Trump’s most comprehensive health care plans failed to pass Congress. Even though Republicans did succeed in repealing the individual mandate as part of their tax bill, experts were around the same time concluding that the mandate was not as essential to the law functioning as previously believed. Obamacare enrollment stayed mostly steady in the first year after the mandate penalty was zeroed out.
Trump’s record on health care is largely his administrative actions — and those are most vulnerable to being undone by the courts or the incoming Biden administration. Many of his most significant achievements already appear to be at risk.
The Trump administration approved, for the first time in history, Medicaid work requirements in several states, conditioning a person’s eligibility for health insurance on whether they are working or looking for work. But those requirements were blocked by the courts, which questioned whether they met Medicaid’s objectives as it quickly became clear that thousands of people would lose coverage.
The Supreme Court will hear a lawsuit challenging Medicaid work requirements in the coming year, and legal experts actually believe there is a chance the conservative-leaning high court will side with the lower courts and block work requirements from taking effect. Alongside the Obamacare case, the justices could spell the end to another one of Trump’s health care priorities.
A sense of desperation clearly kicked in during the final months of Trump’s term. Trump’s No. 2 health official, Seema Verma, worked overtime in the final days of the administration to ensconce some of the administration’s agenda for Medicaid. A waiver to establish Medicaid spending caps in Tennessee, also known as block grants, was approved, as were waivers proposed by conservative governors in Tennessee and Florida.
The problem, according to experts, is that these Medicaid waivers are approved at the discretion of the federal government. The Biden administration is not going to be friendly toward work requirements or block grants. Verma has tried to put in place procedural barriers to unwinding these last-minute approvals, but the consensus of experts is that Biden should be able to reverse them, though it will surely take time and a lot of paperwork.
Some of Trump’s other actions — such as cutting Obamacare outreach funding — can be nixed with the stroke of a pen. Others, like various plans to cut drug prices, have been proposed but never finalized as regulations and therefore will not actually take effect unless Biden takes them across the finish line.
This shoddy legal and regulatory work has exposed Trump’s health care policies to being quickly and permanently nullified. Even his administration’s most successful action could be weakened if Biden succeeds in passing the Covid-19 stimulus plan he has proposed.
Having failed to repeal Obamacare, the Trump health department proposed and did actually finalize a regulation expanding short-term limited-duration insurance. Those plans are not subject to the ACA’s rules about preexisting conditions and, under these new regulations, they would be allowed to last as long as three years. Trump officials portrayed them as a cheaper, free-market alternative to Obamacare, though their sales have been plagued by misleading marketing, and patients have sometimes found that these plans do not provide the level of coverage they were led to believe.
Nevertheless, enrollment in those plans did grow under Trump, up to about 3 million consumers, according to the best estimates. The merits could be debated, but the impact was real.
When I asked health policy experts about what Biden could do administratively to change health care, I was surprised when several of them said they weren’t sure whether he would be able to reverse Trump’s expansion of short-term plans. Their thinking was that the Biden team might be hesitant to yank those plans, cheap and substandard though they are, away from people without giving them an alternative.
But then Democrats won both Georgia Senate runoffs, and with them control of the Senate, and suddenly Biden’s legislative agenda had some life. As part of his Covid-19 stimulus plan, Biden is proposing to make Obamacare’s premium assistance more generous and to make more people eligible for it. People might be more willing to drop a short-term plan and sign up for Obamacare if those proposals pass and ACA-compliant plans are cheaper.
There was one Trump policy that Levitt thought could leave a lasting impression: new requirements that health care providers and insurers disclose more data about the prices paid for medical services. But there’s a twist.
“The data that will become available could shine a spotlight on how high prices are and how much they vary,” he said. “Perhaps ironically, Trump’s market-oriented price transparency regulation could help build support for more regulatory approaches to deal with high costs.”"

","A lengthy New Yorker profile of White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tries to answer why someone who is a devout Christian can justify repeatedly lying on behalf of President Donald Trump.
In part, the profile concludes that Sanders is willing to lie for the president because he has actually kept the promises he made to evangelical Christians, especially regarding the appointment of hard-line conservative judges.
The piece cites Washington Post religion reporter Michelle Boorstein, who says that evangelicals are happy to have a president who will do what they say -- a stark contrast to past politicians who ""have broken promises to Christian conservatives.""
It then quotes former Baptist pastor Brian Kaylor, a frequent critic of the president who believes most evangelicals see Trump's 2016 election victory as a divine intervention that justifies excusing almost any kind of immoral behavior by the president.
""It’s more than you are defending a politician, or even a President,"" he explained of Sanders' mindset. ""You are defending God’s chosen leader for this time."""
Liberal,"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-talk-preserving-our-heritage-sick-and-reminiscent-hitler-says-1349955
","CNN national security analyst Samantha Vinograd on Saturday said President Donald Trump's talk of preserving our ""heritage"" during his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) made her feel ""sick"" and argued it was reminiscent of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.
Trump addressed the CPAC for more than two hours earlier today, where he claimed that those in attendance at the conservative conference ""are on the front lines of protecting America's interests, defending America's values, and reclaiming our nation's priceless heritage.""
""With your help, we are reversing decades of blunders and betrayals,"" the president added. ""These are serious, serious betrayals to our nation and to everything we stand for. It's been done by the failed ruling class that enriched foreign countries at our expense. It wasn't America first, in many cases it was America last. Those days are over, long over.""
Following Trump's speech in Maryland, Vinograd, who previously worked in former President Barack Obama's administration, appeared on CNN to discuss the president's statements, comparing them to those of Hitler.
""His statements make me sick, on a personal level, preserving our heritage, reclaiming our heritage, that sounds a lot like a certain leader that killed members of my family and about six million other Jews in the 1940s,"" she said.
Vinograd then argued that the rest of Trump's speech sounded like it was scripted by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""By the way, this whole CPAC speech, how many pieces, parts of President Putin's to-do list was President Trump trying to accomplish today?"" she said. ""He denigrated our institutions, the Department of Justice and U.S. Congress, he spread misinformation and conspiracy theories, he undermined the credibility of several of our institutions, he sewed divisions, he sowed confusion, he was speaking to his base but he was also saying things that really looked like Vladimir Putin scripted his speech.
So it helped him perhaps with his base, and politically, while at the same time, making Russia's job a lot easier,"" Vinograd added.
In the past, Trump also has used the annual meeting with right-wing supporters to fire up his base. After the president hugged the U.S. flag after walking on stage, he launched into his two-hour address, where he took aim at congressional Democrats and repeatedly criticized special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation.
Trump also called House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, one of the top Democrats who's heading investigations on Russia-related matters, ""Little Shifty Schiff.""
""Unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions, and they leave people for a long time that should not be there,"" Trump said. ""All of a sudden, they are trying to take you out with bulls--t. With bulls--t."""

","What the hell happened with the polls this year?
Yes, the polls correctly predicted that Joe Biden would win the presidency. But they got all kinds of details, and a number of Senate races, badly wrong. FiveThirtyEight’s polling models projected that Biden would win Wisconsin by 8.3 points; with basically all the votes in, he won by a mere 0.63 percent, a miss of more than 7 points. In the Maine Senate race, FiveThirtyEight estimated that Democrat Sara Gideon would beat Republican incumbent Susan Collins by 2 points; Gideon lost by 9 points, an 11-point miss.
Biden’s lead was robust enough to hold even with this kind of polling error, but the leads of candidates like Gideon (or apparently, though it’s not officially called yet, Cal Cunningham in North Carolina) were not. Not all ballots have been counted yet, which could change polling-miss estimates, but a miss is already evident in states like Wisconsin and Maine where the votes are almost all in.
To try to make sense of the massive failure of polling this year, I reached out to the smartest polling guy I know: David Shor, an independent data analyst who’s a veteran of the Obama presidential campaigns who formerly operated a massive web-based survey at Civis Analytics before leaving earlier this year. He now works advising super PACs on ad testing. Since 2016, Shor’s been trying to sell me, and basically anyone else who’ll listen, on a particular theory of what went wrong in polling that year, and what he thinks went wrong with polling in 2018 and 2020, too.
The theory is that the kind of people who answer polls are systematically different from the kind of people who refuse to answer polls — and that this has recently begun biasing the polls in a systematic way.
This challenges a core premise of polling, which is that you can use the responses of poll takers to infer the views of the population at large — and that if there are differences between poll takers and non-poll takers, they can be statistically “controlled” for by weighting according to race, education, gender, and so forth. (Weighting increases and decreases the importance of responses from particular groups in a poll to better match their share of the actual population.) If these two groups do differ systematically, that means the results are biased.
The assumption that poll respondents and non-respondents are basically similar, once properly weighted, used to be roughly right — and then, starting in 2016, it became very, very wrong. People who don’t answer polls, Shor argues, tend to have low levels of trust in other people more generally. These low-trust folks used to vote similarly to everyone else. But as of 2016, they don’t: they tend to vote for Republicans.
Now, in 2020, Shor argues that the differences between poll respondents and non-respondents have gotten larger still. In part due to Covid-19 stir-craziness, Democrats, and particularly highly civically engaged Democrats who donate to and volunteer for campaigns, have become likelier to answer polls. It’s something to do when we’re all bored, and it feels civically useful. This biased the polls, Shor argues, in deep ways that even the best polls (including his own) struggled to account for.
Liberal Democrats answered more polls, so the polls overrepresented liberal Democrats and their views (even after weighting), and thus the polls gave Biden and Senate Democrats inflated odds of winning.
Shor and I talked over Zoom on November 5 about the 2020 polling miss, how he’s trying to prevent it from happening again (at least with his own survey), and why qualitative research is vulnerable to these same problems. A transcript, edited for length and clarity, follows.
Dylan Matthews
So, David: What the hell happened with the polls this year?
David Shor
So the basic story is that, particularly after Covid-19, Democrats got extremely excited and had very high rates of engagement. They were donating at higher rates, etc., and this translated to them also taking surveys, because they were locked at home and didn’t have anything else to do. There’s some pretty clear evidence that that’s nearly all of it: It was partisan non-response. Democrats just started taking a bunch of surveys [when they were called by pollsters, while Republicans did not].
Just to put some numbers on that, if you look at the early vote results and compare it with the crosstabs of what public polls said early voters were going to be, it’s pretty clear that early voters were considerably less Democratic than people thought. Campaign pollsters can actually join survey takers to voter files, and starting in March, the percentage of our survey takers who were, say, ActBlue donors skyrocketed. The average social trust of respondents went up, core attitudes changed — basically, liberals just started taking surveys at really high rates. That’s what happened.
Dylan Matthews
You mentioned social trust. Walk me through your basic theory about how people who agree to take surveys have higher levels of social trust, and how that has biased the polls in recent years.
David Shor
For three cycles in a row, there’s been this consistent pattern of pollsters overestimating Democratic support in some states and underestimating support in other states. This has been pretty consistent. It happened in 2018. It happened in 2020. And the reason that’s happening is because the way that [pollsters] are doing polling right now just doesn’t work.
Poll Twitter tends to ascribe these mystical powers to these different pollsters. But they’re all doing very similar things. Fundamentally, every “high-quality public pollster” does random digit dialing. They call a bunch of random numbers, roughly 1 percent of people pick up the phone, and then they ask stuff like education, and age, and race, and gender, sometimes household size. And then they weight it up to the census, because the census says how many adults do all of those things. That works if people who answer surveys are the same as people who don’t, once you control for age and race and gender and all this other stuff.
But it turns out that people who answer surveys are really weird. They’re considerably more politically engaged than normal. I put in a five-factor test [a kind of personality survey] and they have much higher agreeableness [a measure of how cooperative and warm people are], which makes sense, if you think about literally what’s happening.
They also have higher levels of social trust. I use the General Social Survey’s question, which is, “Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people?” The way the GSS works is they hire tons of people to go get in-person responses. They get a 70 percent response rate. We can basically believe what they say.
It turns out, in the GSS, that 70 percent of people say that people can’t be trusted. And if you do phone surveys, and you weight, you will get that 50 percent of people say that people can be trusted. It’s a pretty massive gap. [Sociologist] Robert Putnam actually did some research on this, but people who don’t trust people and don’t trust institutions are way less likely to answer phone surveys. Unsurprising! This has always been true. It just used to not matter.
It used to be that once you control for age and race and gender and education, that people who trusted their neighbors basically voted the same as people who didn’t trust their neighbors. But then, starting in 2016, suddenly that shifted. If you look at white people without college education, high-trust non-college whites tended toward [Democrats], and low-trust non-college whites heavily turned against us. In 2016, we were polling this high-trust electorate, so we overestimated Clinton. These low-trust people still vote, even if they’re not answering these phone surveys.
Dylan Matthews
So that’s 2016. Same story in 2018 and 2020?
David Shor
The same biases happened again in 2018, which people didn’t notice because Democrats won anyway. What’s different about this cycle is that in 2016 and 2018, the national polls were basically right. This time, we’ll see when all the ballots get counted, but the national polls were pretty wrong. If you look at why, I think the answer is related, which is that people who answer phone surveys are considerably more politically engaged than the overall population.
If you match to vote history, literally 95 percent of people who answer phone surveys vote. That’s the problem with “likely voter screens” [which try to improve polls by limiting them to the likeliest respondents to vote]. If you restrict to people who have never voted in an election before, 70 percent of phone survey takers vote. If you restrict to people who say they will definitely not vote, 76 percent of those people vote.
Normally that doesn’t matter, because political engagement is actually not super correlated with partisanship. That is normally true, and if it wasn’t, polling would totally break. In 2020, they broke. There were very, very high levels of political engagement by liberals during Covid. You can see in the data it really happened around March. Democrats’ public Senate polling started surging in March. Liberals were cooped up, because of Covid, and so they started answering surveys more and being more engaged.
This gets to something that’s really scary about polling, which is that polling is fundamentally built on this assumption that people who answer surveys are the same as people who don’t, once you condition on enough things. That can be true at any given time. But these things that we’re trying to measure are constantly changing. And so you can have a method that worked in past cycles suddenly break.
Dylan Matthews
Why can’t you just fix that by weighting? Why not just control the results by sexual orientation or religion to get around that problem?
David Shor
You can know from the GSS, say, how many people nationwide have low levels of social trust. But that doesn’t tell you — what about likely voters? Or what about likely voters in Ohio’s 13th Congressional District? How does that break out by race or gender or education? How does that interact with turnout? All that stuff becomes quite hard.
There’s a reason pollsters don’t weight by everything. Say you have 800 responses. The more variables you weight by, the lower your effective sample size is. Once the number of things you control for increases past a certain point, traditional techniques start to fail and you need to start doing machine learning and modeling.
This is the bigger point about the industry I’m trying to make. There used to be a world where polling involved calling people, applying classical statistical adjustments, and putting most of the emphasis on interpretation. Now you need voter files and proprietary first-party data and teams of machine learning engineers. It’s become a much harder problem.
Dylan Matthews
One reaction I’ve seen from several quarters is that 2020 shows that quantitative methods aren’t enough to understand the electorate, and pollsters need to do more to incorporate ethnographic techniques, deep interviews, etc. In a way, you’re proposing the opposite: Pollsters need to get way more sophisticated in their quantitative methods to overcome the biases that wrecked the polls this year. Am I understanding that right?
David Shor
I mean, I’m not a robot. Qualitative research and interpretation are important for winning elections. But I think it’s a misunderstanding of why polls were wrong.
A lot of people think that the reason why polls were wrong was because of “shy Trump voters.” You talk to someone, they say they’re undecided, or they say they’re gonna vote for Biden, but it wasn’t real. Then, maybe if you had a focus group, they’d say, “I’m voting for Biden, but I don’t know.” And then your ethnographer could read the uncertainty and decide, “Okay, this isn’t really a firm Biden voter.” That kind of thing is very trendy as an explanation.
But it’s not why the polls were wrong. It just isn’t. People tell the truth when you ask them who they’re voting for. They really do, on average. The reason why the polls are wrong is because the people who were answering these surveys were the wrong people. If you do your ethnographic research, if you try to recruit these focus groups, you’re going to have the same biases. They recruit focus groups by calling people! Survey takers are weird. People in focus groups are even weirder. Qualitative research doesn’t solve the problem of one group of people being really, really excited to share their opinions, while another group isn’t. As long as that bias exists, it’ll percolate down to whatever you do."

","Democratic nominee Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, have both tested negative for the coronavirus, his campaign has confirmed.
There were fears Biden had been exposed to the coronavirus at Tuesday’s presidential debate in Cleveland, when he appeared onstage with President Donald Trump. Trump and first lady Melania Trump have both tested positive for the coronavirus, the president announced in a tweet early Friday morning. While it sometimes takes several days for a person to test positive after contracting the virus, the Bidens have initially tested negative.
“Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden underwent PCR testing for COVID-19 today and COVID-19 was not detected,” said the Bidens’ doctor Dr. Kevin O’Connor in a statement. “I am reporting this out in my capacity as both Vice President Biden and Dr. Biden’s primary care physician.”
The Biden campaign has not been informed of possible coronavirus exposure by the White House or the Trump campaign, a senior Biden campaign official told CNN and NBC.
Biden tweeted his well-wishes to the president and first lady on Friday morning.
Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 2, 2020
It’s so far unclear if Trump was contagious during the debate. Biden’s and Trump’s podiums were spaced far apart on the debate stage, which helps reduce the likelihood of exhaled droplets from Trump being inhaled by Biden.
Biden has also been diligent about wearing a mask at his campaign events and public appearances, a fact Trump mocked him for at Tuesday’s debate.
Biden’s campaign has been doing in-person events for a few months, but all events have had small numbers of attendees, all of whom are carefully spaced 6 feet apart and wearing masks. The Bidens have been on a train tour of Midwestern states following Tuesday’s debate.
The former vice president has also been taking extra personal precautions since this spring, following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for limiting one’s exposure to the virus.
“I wash my hands God knows how many times a day with hot water and soap,” Biden said this spring. “I carry with me … as a matter of fact, I have it in my bag outside here … hand sanitizer. I don’t know how many times a day I use that. I make sure I don’t touch my face, and so on. So I’m taking all the precautions we’ve told everybody else to take.”
During a spring Democratic primary debate, Biden told CNN’s moderators that even though he is 77 years old, he does not have any underlying health conditions like diabetes, or heart or lung disease, that can lead to more serious complications.
“Fortunately I don’t have any of the underlying conditions that you talked about, number one,” Biden said. “Number two, thank God — for the time being, anything can happen, knock on wood — I’m in good health.”"

","Authorities said the gunman — identified as Ian David Long, a 28-year-old Marine veteran who was cleared by a mental-health specialist after an encounter with police earlier this year — was found dead inside after apparently killing himself. Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said Thursday morning that investigators have not been able to determine a motive.

The bloodshed spread throughout the Borderline Bar & Grill, a popular nightspot in Thousand Oaks, Calif., a city near Los Angeles. When the gunfire began, people were line dancing during the venue’s “College Country Night,” witnesses said. That detail evoked the massacre of 58 people at a country-music festival in Las Vegas a little more than a year earlier — a connection deepened when some of those who escaped Borderline said they had also survived that massacre.
AD
Police said Long, wearing a black sweater and wielding a .45-caliber Glock handgun with an extended magazine, approached the bar and shot a security guard standing outside. He then headed in and shot other employees before turning his fire on patrons, Dean said.
“It’s a horrific scene in there,” Dean, who is set to retire Friday night, told reporters. “There’s blood everywhere.”
The gunfire set off a panic, as patrons grimly familiar with stories of shooting rampages at churches, schools, movie theaters, offices and other locations across the country scrambled for safety and shelter.

“They ran out of back doors, they broke windows, they went through windows, they hid up in the attic, they hid in the bathroom,"" Dean said. ""Unfortunately, our young people, people at nightclubs, have learned that this may happen. They think about that. Fortunately, it probably saved a lot of lives that they fled the scene so rapidly.”

Benjamin Ginsburg, 23, said he hid under a table and then, hearing gunfire from the front, ran with other people toward the rear exits. Teylor Whittler, 19, said a man named Ethan “picked me up because I kept getting ... trampled,” carrying her out the back door and saving her life. She said many people then hid behind bushes, in their cars or underneath the vehicles in the parking lot.
Among the dead was Ron Helus, a veteran sergeant in the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office who was mortally wounded when he responded to the incident just minutes after 911 calls began flooding in, authorities said.
Helus and a Highway Patrol officer headed into the club and exchanged fire with the attacker, Dean said. Helus, a 29-year veteran of the force with a grown son, had been on the phone with his wife when he got the call about the shooting and headed to the club, Dean said. During the shootout, he was struck several times.

“He died a hero,” Dean said, his voice cracking, “because he went in to save lives.""
The latest attack carried echoes and reminders of others. The descriptions of chaos inside the club were similar to those reported during the slaughter of 49 clubgoers at Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016; the rampage in California occurred about 100 miles away from a community center where 14 were killed during a 2015 terror attack in San Bernardino, Calif.

Dean alluded to these earlier attacks, saying the carnage in Borderline “is part of the horrors that are happening in our country and everywhere, and I think it’s impossible to put any logic or any sense to the senseless.”
When asked by a reporter what it looked like inside the venue, Dean responded: “Like hell.”
California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) said in a statement that “our hearts ache today for the victims of this heinous act” and thanked Helus and other law enforcement officials “who took heroic action to save lives.” President Trump ordered flags to be flown at half-staff until sunset on Saturday in response to the “terrible act of violence perpetrated in Thousand Oaks.”

In addition to those slain at the club, Dean said he believed between eight and 15 other people were injured, mostly with cuts from diving under tables and jumping through windows. One person had a minor gunshot injury, he said.

Cody Coffman, a 22-year-old who had been talking to recruiters about fulfilling his dream of joining the Army, was among those killed, his father said Thursday morning.
“I am speechless and heartbroken,” Jason Coffman said outside the Thousand Oaks Teen Center, where families were gathering in the wake of the attack.
Coffman, at times so overwhelmed he could not speak, leaned on his father-in-law to steady himself. He said he last saw his son as the younger man was heading out last night.

“The last thing I said was, ‘Son, I love you,'” he said.
Sarah Deson, 19, said Cody Coffman stood in front of her as the shooter approached from the front entrance. Coffman yelled for everyone to get down and told her to run for the front door as the shooter moved farther into the bar, she said.
“Cody saved so many people last night, he was shielding people and getting them out,” she said.

A group of more than a dozen people walked out of one building at the center huddled together. The teen center had become a de facto staging ground for relatives because authorities were notifying families and close friends there about victims. Families could be seen crying and hugging each other; outside, a man with a hoodie pulled up over his head sat on the curb while another man sat nearby and placed a hand on his shoulder.
What could have motivated the attack remained a mystery to authorities, Dean said. The FBI said it was processing the crime scene at the bar as well as the attacker’s home and vehicle at the request of Dean’s office and would pursue leads “to identify any possible motivation.”

The Marine Corps said Long served between August 2008 and March 2013. He served as a machine gunner in Afghanistan from November 2010 to June 2011 and became a corporal two months later. California State University Northridge said Long was a former student there who last attended the school in 2016.
AD
Gen. Robert B. Neller, commandant of the Marine Corps, tweeted on Thursday his condolences and pointedly referred to Long as “that ex-Marine” in his message:
Dean said Long lived in Newbury Park, Calif., a town near Thousand Oaks. Police have had “several contacts” with Long over the years, Dean said, most of them for minor events including traffic accidents. In April, deputies were called to Long’s home for a disturbance call, Dean said.
AD
“They went to the house, they talked to him,"" he said. “He was somewhat irate, acting a little irrationally. They called out our crisis intervention team, our mental health specialist, who met with him, talked to him and cleared him.”
Part of the discussion among those responding to Long’s home was that “he might be suffering from PTSD,” Dean said, pointing to the 28-year-old’s military service. But “the mental health experts out there cleared him that day,” Dean continued, and no involuntary holds were placed on Long.
AD
The gun used in the bar massacre appeared to have been purchased legally, Dean said.
Relatives of Long could not be immediately reached for comment Thursday. A former roommate described Long as “quiet, really really quiet"" and prone to unusual behavior — like dancing alone in the garage to trance music — but said he never saw any signs of mental-health issues.
Neighbors of the home where Long lived with his mother recalled the police visit in April. Richard Berge, who lived around the corner, said he saw police cars blocking the street and saw officers standing across the street with a rifle.
Carol Richardson, who lives a few houses down from the Longs, said she heard yelling and banging before the police arrived in April. After Wednesday night’s shooting, she said, her son texted her saying: ""I bet it was that guy.” She said there were other incidents involving Long. Her 19-year-old daughter, Morgan, said: “We always knew he had problems.”
Reports of a shooting first came in about 11:20 p.m. Pacific time Wednesday, and authorities arrived on the scene at 11:22 p.m., Dean said. After Helus was struck, the highway patrol officer secured the perimeter, Dean said.
Six off-duty police officers from other agencies were inside, Dean said. He said the parent of one person who was there told him the officers stood in front of her daughter to protect her.
Witnesses reported seeing smoke, but it was unclear if those were from smoke bombs, Dean said.
The shooting unfolded a little more than a year after a lone gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, killing 58 people. The Sutherland Springs church massacre that killed 26 people followed just weeks later.
Many of those at the Las Vegas festival last year had come from California, and some at the venue in Thousand Oaks also said they survived that earlier attack. Chandler Gunn, 23, told the Los Angeles Times that when he heard about the shooting, he called a friend who works at the bar and was also at the Route 91 Harvest Festival targeted in Las Vegas a year earlier.
“A lot of people in the Route 91 situation go here,” Gunn told the newspaper after the Thousand Oaks shooting. “There’s people that live a whole lifetime without seeing this, and then there’s people that have seen it twice.”
The Borderline Bar describes itself as Ventura County’s largest country dance hall and live music venue. With a dance floor covering about 2,500 square feet, it is open until 2 a.m. five days a week. Authorities said more than 100 were inside at the time of the shooting. Scores of colleges lie within a 20-mile radius of the bar, including Pepperdine University, California State University at Channel Islands, Moorpark College and California Lutheran University, which has its own line dance club.
Pepperdine officials said that multiple students from the school were at the bar during the shooting. California Lutheran canceled classes “given the tragedy and uncertainties.”
While officials haven’t released the names and ages of those killed and injured, the combination of factors — a bar near colleges on a weeknight — suggested that many are likely in their late teens and 20s.
Matt Wennerstrom, a regular at the bar, told reporters he saw the gunman open fire on employees working at the front of the bar.
“At that point I grabbed as many people around me as I could and pulled them down underneath the pool table that we were closest to until he ran out of bullets for that magazine and had to reload,” he told ABC.
During the pause, Wennerstrom, 20, said he and others threw bar stools through a window and helped people escape. He told ABC he was able to push “30 or 35 people through that window.”
Rochelle Hammons, 24, told The Post that she heard four shots before she was able to flee.
“Everyone got down on the floor,"" she said. ""Everyone ducked and covered each other As everyone crouched down on the floor, I figured that my only chance would be to run out to the nearest exit. I saw the nearest exit, and I ran out as fast as I could.”

Liberal,"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-04-22/ap-interview-gore-says-backing-biden-isnt-rocket-science
","Former Vice President Al Gore, now one of the world’s leading climate activists, endorsed Joe Biden’s White House bid on Wednesday, declaring that choosing the presumptive Democratic nominee over President Trump is “not rocket science” and “not a close call.”
“This is the clearest, most definitive choice in a national election that the United States of America has ever faced, especially for people who care about the climate,” Gore told the Associated Press.
Gore, 72, didn’t rehash the 2000 presidential election, when he lost to President George W. Bush by a razor-thin margin tilted partly by third-party progressive Ralph Nader. But Gore alluded to the similar threat facing Biden, with some young activists and progressives — including among climate activists — lukewarm toward his candidacy.
“If there is any person in America who cares about the climate crisis and has any doubt whatsoever about the importance of voting for Joe Biden this November, I want to emphasize to that person in as strong a way as I possibly can: This is not complicated,” Gore said. “This is not rocket science. This is not a close call.”

He said it was imperative to defeat Trump, “the anti-climate president and the face of climate denial worldwide.”
Gore’s endorsement came on the 50th observance of Earth Day. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a former 2020 rival who focused his presidential bid on combating climate change, also endorsed Biden on Wednesday. And on Monday, Biden won the backing of the League of Conservation Voters Action Fund.
Gore and Biden, who served together in the Senate before their respective vice presidencies, appeared together later Wednesday on a split-screen online livestream from their homes, Biden in Wilmington, Del., and Gore in Nashville.
“Beating Trump won’t end climate change, but it’s a critical first step,” Biden said, adding that Trump isn’t just refusing to act but is “eviscerating” regulations that mitigate the crisis.

Gore told AP that Biden had asked him to “engage in an ongoing dialogue” to “strengthen his climate platform considerably.” He declined to get into the specifics of his policy discussions with Biden or his campaign aides, but he said Biden already had the right focus and had expressed a willingness to make climate action his “top priority.”
Biden last summer unveiled a $5-trillion, decade-long plan to combat the climate crisis; $1.7 trillion of that total would come from the government, the rest from the private sector. Biden’s plan falls short of the Green New Deal advanced by some Democrats, especially in the timeline he envisions for eliminating carbon pollution from the economy.
Biden’s plan calls for tax breaks, direct spending and more aggressive federal regulations. He’d start with reversing many actions of the Trump administration, which has rolled back a range of Obama administration efforts on energy and the environment. Biden would add an aggressive push on the world stage, using U.S. political and economic muscle to limit emissions from other nations, including China.

Gore supports the efforts of Democrats pushing the Green New Deal on Capitol Hill. But he also calls it an “aspirational” plan that likely wouldn’t clear Congress in one sweeping act. Much more likely, he argues, is a series of actions that flow from an administration prioritizing the overall issue.
Gore was adamant Wednesday that the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting flurry of emergency spending measures shouldn’t derail climate as the top national priority. Rather, he said, the economic fallout highlights the need.
“We need to speed things up by putting tens of millions of people to work in every community in this country” doing everything from installing solar panels and retrofitting buildings to overhauling agricultural practices, Gore said. “It will be the biggest boost to sustainable economic growth that we’ve ever had.”
In their online event, Gore and Biden compared the dynamics of the climate debate to earlier movements, such as those that led to the abolition of slavery, women’s suffrage and, more recently, marriage rights for same-sex couples.

“You look at all of those social revolutions, and they all have one thing in common: They seemed impossible,” Gore said. “But they kept on going and they crossed a threshold where, finally, the majority of people said, oh, OK, I get it. This is about justice. This is about fairness. This is about a bright future.”
As for his own future, Gore made clear that his days in government are finished.
“I’m not looking for any job,” he quipped. “I gave at the office.”
Gore’s public profile, both during his long political career and since, has been defined by his advocacy on environmental issues and the climate crisis.

As a young congressman in the early 1980s, he stood out for holding hearings on global warming before it was a routine part of public discourse. As vice president, Gore helped craft the Kyoto Treaty — a forerunner of the Paris Agreement of 2016, which Biden was involved in crafting — but watched the U.S. Senate refuse ratification, just as Trump has scoffed at the Paris deal.
Since leaving the vice presidency in 2001, Gore has won the Nobel Peace Prize for his activism and an Oscar for his documentary, “An Inconvenient Truth.”"

","There are numerous problems with Trump's brag here. Trump is giving credit for his decision to send ventilators to up-for-reelection Republican Sen. Cory Gardner—but Trump had previously ignored the requests of the state's Democratic governor, instead now clearly suggesting that his decision was based on the politics of the person asking. Trump has done this before, last year crediting Sen. Thom Tillis for his decision to declare a national disaster in North Carolina after Hurricane Dorian rather than any of the other state officials begging for the same. Tillis was in a tough reelection battle, as Gardner is now; Trump's use of national disasters to reward patrons and damage enemies, regardless of what lives he endangers, is apace with his half-authoritarian, half-stupidity-based willingness to use all the rest of government as similar slush fund.
But bragging about relinquishing a mere hundred ventilators to Colorado after his government seized five times that number out from under Colorado—that is, if possible, lower.
Last week, CNN reported that Colorado had ordered 500 of the devices, but the manufacturer canceled their order—along with ""many"" other orders—when Federal Emergency Management Agency officials moved in to buy the same equipment themselves. ""States aren't just competing for ventilators with other states, but also with FEMA,"" said CNN's quoted ""congressional source.""
On Friday, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis confirmed the canceled order. ""Either work with us, or don’t do anything at all,"" he told CNN host Don Lemon. ""But this middle ground where they’re buying stuff out from under us, and not telling us what we’re going to get, that’s really challenging to manage our hospital surge and the safety of our health care workers in that kind of environment.”
We still do not know just what, to put it bluntly, the hell the Trump administration is doing in its bizarre procurement efforts. The administration did not make any major attempts to procure emergency medical supplies until just weeks ago, despite the critical urgency and known shortages. After national outrage swelled to levels that could no longer be ignored, Trump's team (led, in some as-of-yet-inexplicable manner, by Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner) sought to ""solve"" the problem by reaching down into supply chains to seize materials being procured by states and hospitals themselves—doing nothing to solve the problem of short supply, but helping to further raise prices and spark bidding wars.
For Trump to brag, in the middle of that half-fiasco, half-malevolent clusterf--k, that he is graciously providing a fraction of the supplies his government prevented a state from getting in the first place, is ... typical. For Trump, it is typical. We also cannot simply take him at his word that those 100 ventilators will arrive in Colorado; he has lied repeatedly over near-identical things, and will continue to do so.
The 10,000 American deaths and rising have had no impact on him. The depression-level scale of unemployment, as botched testing and slow response led to a need for nationwide stay-at-home orders, have had no impact on him. His metrics remain the same: Which things make him look good, on his television set? Which make him look bad?
He envisions himself as hero-emperor of a crisis of his own making. He will reward his allies, and punish his enemies. Whether 400 missing ventilators will result in deaths does not enter his mind. The supposed United States president hasn't shown any concern over whether Americans lived or died from the first days of the crisis onward. He pretended it was not happening until he could no longer pretend. He insisted it would be small and trivial until it was large and catastrophic. He says now it will be short, when it is absolutely assured to be long.
And he tweets, and holds the most bizarre press conferences the White House has ever seen in any era, demanding praise and making threats towards reporters, lawmakers, and elected officials who decline to provide it."

","President Donald Trump's controversial nomination for a lifetime seat on the United States Supreme Court could end the political career of Maine's Republican senator, Susan Collins.
Collins, who has branded herself as pro-choice, has been heavily criticized for backing the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the high court.
Bestselling author Stephen King, who lives in Maine, slammed the conservative lawmaker for supporting President Donald Trump's nominee.
""If Susan Collins votes to confirm Kavanaugh, and if she runs for re-election -- two bigs ifs -- she will be defeated,"" King tweeted on Saturday.
""It would be unwise for anyone to mistake how angry most Americans are at the way this is being railroaded through,"" he added.
King, whose 58 novels have sold more than 350 million copies, was born in Portland, Maine and attended the University of Maine. King currently lives in Bangor.
This was not King's first time pressuring his senator on a confirmation vote.
In January of 2017, King asked his Twitter followers to ""Please ask Susan Collins, a sane Republican senator, to vote against the totally unqualified Betsy DeVos.""
A week later, following the vote, King praised Sen. Collins.
""Thanks to Susan Collins for saying 'no' on Betsy DeVos. Notice that it's possible to be a good Republican and still say no to Donald Trump,"" King argued."

","Donald “No Collusion!” Trump Photo: Ron Sachs/Getty Images
Earlier this summer, President Trump asked his lawyers about pardoning his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort. Giuliani told the president such a maneuver would be inadvisable and could expose Trump to a possible obstruction of justice charge. “We sat [Trump] down and said you’re not considering these other pardons with anybody involved in the investigation. He said yes, absolutely, I understand,” Giuliani told the Washington Post, “The real concern is whether [Robert] Mueller would turn any pardon into an obstruction charge.”
Yesterday, Trump went ahead and dangled a pardon for Manafort anyway. “It was never discussed,” he told the New York Post, falsely, before continuing, “but I wouldn’t take it off the table. Why would I take it off the table?”
Dangling a pardon like this is an extremely serious offense. It was one of the very crimes for which Nixon was going to be impeached. This naturally raises the question of why Trump would obstruct justice so blatantly.
Trump’s explanation is that he feels badly for Manafort, who he believes is being treated unfairly by the Department of Justice. So, by this account, Trump is putting himself at risk of an obstruction charge just so he can defend his former campaign manager (who he has dismissed as someone who “came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time.” That doesn’t sound like something Trump would do.
Yet Trump has taken this risk over and over. From the moment he learned about the Russia investigation, he asked the FBI director to go easy on its principal subject, Michael Flynn. He hasn’t stopped obstructing justice since. He fired Comey for failing to show loyalty, fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions for the same reason — and admitted in public he hired Sessions only because he expected loyalty — and replaced him with a hack who had already indicated agreement with his views of the case.
Trump’s lawyers have formed joint defense agreements with Jerome Corsi, who Mueller appears to have dead to rights on both perjury and attempts to collude with Wikileaks. More recently, Trump’s legal team got Manafort to brief them on his interactions with Robert Mueller, a violation that could also expose Trump to obstruction of justice charges, reports NBC. This is an extremely risky legal strategy that, as lawyers such as Harry Litman and Ken White have observed, may allow Mueller “to delve into the Trump lawyers’ conversations with Mr. Manafort’s lawyers.”
A common theory of the Russia scandal is that it consists of nothing more than some low-level shenanigans. Perhaps some cheap grifters attached themselves to Trump and took some inappropriate meetings, but Trump’s campaign did not collude with Putin, and Trump himself has nothing to fear. Trump’s evident rage at the investigation, by this theory, is simply his indignation at the notion that his great victory has been tainted as a cheat with Russian help.
But how could this theory explain the extremely risky moves Trump keeps taking? The endless obstruction of justice, while binding his legal fate ever more tightly to the low-level crooks who supposedly can’t be tied to him — the latter of which requires the assent of Trump’s lawyers — all make no sense. Unless Trump is, in fact, guilty."

","Scientists have called out President Donald Trump after he once again used the cold weather to question the existence of global warming.
On Thursday, the president tweeted: ""Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming?""
Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2018
Trump appeared to be pointing to forecasts that Thanksgiving in the Northeast could be among the coldest on record, due to chilly air traveling down from the Arctic Circle.
Thanks to high pressure sweeping south from Canada to the East Coast, temperatures in the Northeast are predicted to drop between 15° to 25°F lower than is normal in November. New York could see lows not experienced since 1901.
But experts were quick to point out a flaw in Trump's argument: the difference between weather and climate. The term ""weather"" relates to conditions in the atmosphere over a short period of time, whereas ""climate"" denotes long-term trends, according to NASA.
Environmentalist Bill McKibben responded to the president's tweet with a chart illustrating this important difference, by demonstrating how global temperatures have risen by 1.2°C above preindustrial levels.
I know you're Mr. America-is-all-that-matters, but climate is actually a global phenomenon. Here's today's global weather map (oh, and red=hot.) As a whole, Earth is about 1.2 degrees above preindustrial temps today pic.twitter.com/kRaGd7cZF3 — Bill McKibben (@billmckibben) November 22, 2018
Dr. Michael Mann, professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University, told Huffington Post ""[the tweet] demonstrates once again that Donald Trump is not an individual to be taken seriously on any topic, let alone matters as serious as climate change.
""He is a clown — a dangerous clown,"" he said.
Mann told Newsweek: ""It is disturbing to see the titular head of our nation misinforming the public about the greatest threat we face—the threat of catastrophic climate change impacts. Not only has Trump sought to dismantle the environmental protections put in place by previous administrations, he has also sought to lower the level of discourse by making nonsensical public comments that are untruthful factually, and deliberately conflate normal day-to-day weather fluctuations with climate change.
""It is shameful, irresponsible and most unbecoming of someone who would call himself President of the United States.""
This is not the first time Trump has seized a cold snap as an opportunity to question whether climate change is real.
Last year, he tweeted the U.S. ""could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!""
In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 29, 2017
At the time, climate expert Marshall Shepherd explained for Forbes that cold weather events can in fact be a symptom of the wider trend of global warming. A phenomenon known as polar amplification is partly to blame: where a shift in net radiation (the total energy contained in the atmosphere) causes larger changes in temperature at the Earth's poles when compared with the global average. Net radiation can be tweaked by factors including a spike in greenhouse gasses. The consequences, like polar ice caps melting, can trigger extreme weather events: from cold snaps to droughts.
Since taking office, Trump has welcomed fellow climate change skeptics into top positions in his administration. Most recently, physics professor and well-known climate change skeptic William Happer was appointed to the National Security Council as the senior director for emerging technologies. Similarly, Scott Pruitt—who has claimed humans are not the biggest contributor to global warming—was the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, before resigning in August.
Earlier this month, the Environmental Protection Agency ceased to update its websites with information on climate change. Last year, the agency removed around 80 URLs associated with climate change, including epa.gov/climatechange. At the time, the organization said it was a temporary move. But a recent report published by the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative non-profit which assesses federal data on the environment said a note saying the website was under construction was changed to ""we want to help you find what you are looking for.""

","Actress and campaigner Alyssa Milano has weighed in on a viral video that appeared to show Make America Great Again-hatted high school boys chanting in the face of a Native American veteran near the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.
""The red MAGA hat is the new white hood,"" Milano tweeted Sunday, appearing to compare the Trump campaign merchandise to robes worn by the Ku Klux Klan. ""Without white boys being able to empathize with other people, humanity will continue to destroy itself.""
The tweet was one of several posted by the actress apparently in reference to hotly debated viral footage of the group of boys from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky. The students were in the capital for an anti-abortion ""March for Life"" rally, while the Native American campaigner pictured in the video'—Nathan Phillips—was taking part in the Indigenous Peoples' March.
Although the students' behavior was initially condemned on social and mainstream media, by the boys' school and by lawmaker Deb Haaland, responses to the confrontation shifted as more videos quickly emerged.
Phillips told the Detroit Free Press he had intervened in a standoff between the boys and a few members of a group called the Black Hebrew Israelites. He said he put himself between the two groups to defuse the situation. The students, he added ""were in the process of attacking these four black individuals.""
But some have argued the boys' behavior was provoked. ""All they're doing is waiting to get on a bus and they're being yelled at by grown men. Why are they the bad guys?"" parent Jim Wilson told CBS Evening News with Jeff Glor.
The original footage provoked such controversy it was eventually removed by Twitter Monday for breaking the social media site's rules. As a company spokesperson told The Hill, ""Deliberate attempts to manipulate the public conversation on Twitter by using misleading account information is a violation of the Twitter Rules.""
Responding to the controversy surrounding the footage, Milano tweeted Monday: ""Let's not forget—this entire event happened because a group of boys went on a school-sanctioned trip to protest against a woman's right to her own body and reproductive healthcare. It is not debatable that bigotry was at play from the start.""

","An online petition demanding that the Ku Klux Klan be listed as a terrorist organization has gained more than one million signatures in just four days.
The Change.org petition is demanding that the white supremacist hate group be formally listed as a terrorist organization by the government.
Currently, the KKK are classified as a domestic extremist group as there is no definition for domestic terrorism organizations in the U.S.
""Ever since the inception of the Ku Klux Klan in December 24,1865 they have terrorized American citizens for the color of their skin and opposing views,"" the petition states. ""This group has a long history of murder & intimidation of people based on color and religion.
""Black Americans have suffered the most under this terror group.""
The ""Change KKK status into Terrorist Organization"" campaign is one of a number of similar petitions to have gone viral in recent days on the change.org website.
One petition calling for the KKK to be classed as a terrorist organization has gained 178,000 signatures, with a second receiving more than 100,000 before it was closed. Another petition demanding ""Make the KKK illegal"" is also approaching one million signatures.
The petitions started to go viral after President Donald Trump said the far-left and anarchist movement antifa will be treated as a terrorist organization. They also gained popularity amid ongoing debates about race relations in the U.S. in the wake of the death of Minneapolis man George Floyd which sparked worldwide protests.
During one such protest in Richmond, Virginia, a man who allegedly drove into a crowd of people who was later found to be a KKK leader.
The State Department says a group must be a foreign organization who engage in terrorist activity that threatens the security of the U.S. or American citizens to be listed as a terrorist organization.
This means that foreign groups such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda are listed as terrorists, but the KKK are not.
The definition also suggests Trump may not be able to class antifa as terrorists, who are also seen as a movement rather than a coordinated organization.
People who express far-right and white supremacist views are protected by the First Amendment. As domestic terrorism is not a federal offense, those accused of acting on behalf of the KKK or other far-right groups while carrying out an attack or other crimes can only face hate crimes charges.
A State Department spokesperson told Newsweek they do not discuss specific designations or internal deliberations when asked about the petitions calling for the KKK to be classed as a terrorist group.
Elsewhere, another petition calling for acts of racism to be treated as terrorism in the wake of Floyd's death has gained more than 200,000 signatures.
The change.org petition is calling for the introduction of ""George's Law,"" which would expand the definition of terrorism to include racially motivated attacks, as well as listing hate groups such as the KKK as terrorist organizations.
""I would love a situation where we have disbanded this group and say that is a part of our history, and frowned upon,"" activist Michael Anthony, who set up the petition, told Newsweek.

“Randy Levine’s a great friend of mine from the Yankees,” Trump said. “He asked me to throw out the first pitch. And I think I’m doing that on August 15 at Yankee Stadium. And I said, ‘How’s the crowd going to be?' And, it’s like, ‘You don’t have a crowd. There’s no such thing.' It’s gonna be interesting.”

Three days later, Trump said he had to decline the offer.
“Because of my strong focus on the China Virus,” Trump tweeted, referring to the coronavirus, “including scheduled meetings on Vaccines, our economy and much else, I won’t be able to be in New York to throw out the opening pitch for the @Yankees on August 15th. We will make it later in the season!”
However there is a new angle to Trump’s first pitch decision. The New York Times reports Trump never received an offer from the Yankees to play ball on Aug. 15: Mr. Trump had not actually been invited on that day by the Yankees, according to one person with knowledge of Mr. Trump’s schedule. His announcement surprised both Yankees officials and the White House staff.
According to the New York Times, Trump’s first pitch announcement was motivated by the fact that Dr. Anthony Fauci was throwing out the first pitch on Opening Day at Nationals Park before the game between Yankees and Nationals:
Mr. Trump had been so annoyed by Dr. Fauci’s turn in the limelight, an official familiar with his reaction said, that he had directed his aides to call Yankees officials and make good on a longtime standing offer from Mr. Levine to throw out an opening pitch. No date was ever finalized.
Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is the leading immunologist in the country and the face of the Trump administration’s fight against COVID-19.

","In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has moved from dismissing the threat posed to Americans by the coronavirus to styling himself as a “wartime president.” But until mid-March, new reports reveal, he was planning to send the army into battle with only a fraction of the weapons and armor they’d need.
On Sunday, the Associated Press reported that the government largely failed to place bulk orders of N95 respirator masks, ventilators, and other medical equipment vital to those treating coronavirus patients until mid-March, according to federal purchasing contracts. The Washington Post reported that the Trump administration received its first briefing about the outbreak in China on January 3.
On March 12, the day before Trump finally declared a national emergency due to the pandemic, the Department of Health and Human Services placed its first bulk order with 3M for $4.8 million worth of N95 masks. Nine days later, when there were over 30,000 confirmed cases in the country, it placed a larger second order for $173 million. Those masks would be added to the national stockpile, which was created in 1999 in anticipation of potential effects from the Y2K computer bug and expanded following 9/11.
But, the AP reported, the mid-March contracts signed by the federal government and 3M don’t require the company to begin delivering the masks until the end of April — after the White House’s forecasts predict the pandemic will have peaked:
“We basically wasted two months,” Kathleen Sebelius, health and human services secretary during the Obama administration, told AP.
By March 31, according to the Trump administration, more than 11.6 million masks from the stockpile had been distributed to state and local governments. That represents about 90 percent of the stockpile at the start of 2020. According to HHS official Dr. Robert Kadlec’s congressional testimony in March, the US would need about 3.5 billion masks to get through the pandemic.

The stockpile also contains ventilators, machines that helps patients in serious condition breathe. At the beginning of March, the stockpile had 16,660 ventilators, some of which were nearly 20 years old, with 2,425 out for maintenance. On March 31, the White House said it had already distributed half of them.
The federal failure to order equipment until it was far too late to mitigate much of the damage is consistent with the denial and dysfunction that has plagued the administration’s response. And it has left other leaders scrambling to fill gaps, rather than coordinating to get aid to the parts of the country that need it the most.
States are scrambling to pick up the Trump administration’s slack
To understand the holes the federal government’s response has left for states to attempt to fill, look at what’s happening with ventilators.
On March 27, Trump pledged to ensure 100,000 ventilators would be available “within 100 days,” saying he’d use the Defense Production Act to order companies to step up production. That means they’d be available in late June, when experts project the virus will be past its peak in the US. And it’s unclear that it will happen; on April 2, FEMA officials said in a House Oversight and Reform Committee briefing that 100,000 ventilators would be available in late June “at the earliest.”
That delay has created dire situations in places like the state of New York, which has become an early epicenter of the outbreak, with more than 4,100 deaths and 122,000 confirmed coronavirus cases as of April 5.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on April 3 that he anticipated his state alone needing up to 40,000 ventilators for coronavirus patients. FEMA has sent about 4,000 to the state, according to the New York Times. But Cuomo has said he’s essentially stopped assuming that the federal government will be able to help by distributing ventilators to New York from the stockpile. “I know that the ventilator ability is just a problem for everyone — you have 50 states competing for it, you have the federal government trying to buy it,” he said on April 2. “Our attitude here is we’re on our own.”
Because the White House’s strategy for distributing medical equipment and personal protective equipment, such as masks, gowns, and gloves, has been so varied, states have been pitted against one another as they bid for equipment on the open market — or they’ve been forced to take extraordinary measures to obtain equipment for hospitals in their states.
On April 4, Cuomo announced that the Chinese government was sending 1,000 ventilators to New York. Shortly after, he tweeted that Oregon Gov. Kate Brown was sending 140 more.
And Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker worked with Patriots owner Robert Kraft, the Chinese UN ambassador, and Chinese officials to ship 1.2 million masks to the state on the Patriots’ team plane. Baker said in a press conference on April 2 that Massachusetts had previously ordered 3 million masks that were seized by the federal government, so in order to “keep the Feds from finding out” about the masks and seizing them, he had to classify the trip as a “private humanitarian mission.”
Gregory F. Treverton, former chair of the National Intelligence Council, said in an April 4 Washington Post article detailing the extent of the federal dysfunction that “this has been a real blow to the sense that America was competent. That was part of our global role. Traditional friends and allies looked to us because they thought we could be competently called upon to work with them in a crisis. This has been the opposite of that.”"

","A neon sign was placed in front of the White House with a message blaming President Donald Trump for the coronavirus death rate in the U.S..
The display reading ""Trump lied, 200,000 died"" was held up by several democrats and paid for by the DNC, WSET reported.
The sign was lit up on Sunday night as the U.S. is on the verge of hitting the 200,000 milestone for COVID-19 deaths.
As of late Monday morning, Johns Hopkins University places the death toll in the U.S. at 199,525—the highest in the world.
Democrats have accused Trump of misleading the public in claiming that the U.S. is starting to control the spread of the virus, when 31 states are reporting an increase in the number of confirmed cases.
Trump has also been widely criticized after he was recorded in March telling journalist Bob Woodward how he ""wanted to always play it down"" when asked what he knew about the potential dangers of the virus.
""I still like playing it down because I don't want to create a panic,"" Trump told Woodward.
Elsewhere, marches are set to take place across the country in protest at Trump's handling of the outbreak as the 200,000 death toll approaches.
The Refuse Facism group has organized several rallies in cities including New York, Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and Boston this week. The events titled ""March Against Death, Lies, and Fascism and For Humanity"" are scheduled on Monday.
The group has accused Trump of ""continuing to lie, assail science, traffic in conspiracy theories, hold super-spreading rallies, and sabotage attempts to contain the pandemic."" Organisers have also said they fear that Trump will not accept election defeat in November.
Most recent polling has suggested that Democratic nominee Joe Biden will win the upcoming election.
""We face a rolling coup barreling to a showdown on November 3. The Trump/Pence regime have said and shown that they will not abide by an election they lose,"" Coco Das, of the RefuseFascism.org Editorial Board, said in a statement.
""A new path of sustained, non-violent protest is being blazed. A force is gathering that must grow that will not stop until this fascist regime is driven from power. We must make this OUR time, not Trump's.""
""On Monday, September 21, we'll take the next step,"" Das added. ""Marking the grim milestone of 200,000 COVID-19 deaths by holding nationwide marches with the resounding demand for an end to the death, lies, and fascist escalation.""

","The two kinds of gaps appear to have slightly different explanations. “We find evidence that gender disparities by political affiliation are largely driven by violent offenses and drug offenses,” the study said. “We also find that racial disparities by political affiliation are largely driven by drug offenses.”
The authors of the study sounded a note of caution. “The precise reasons why these disparities by political affiliation exist remain unknown and we caution that our results cannot speak to whether the sentences imposed by Republican- or Democratic-appointed judges are warranted or ‘right,’” the authors wrote. “Our results, however, do suggest that Republican- and Democratic-appointed judges treat defendants differently on the basis of their race and gender given that we observe robust disparities despite the random assignment of cases to judges within the same court.”
The study is studded with fascinating tidbits. Black judges treat male and female offenders more equally than white judges do. Black judges appointed by Republicans treat black offenders more leniently than do other Republican appointees.
More experienced judges are less apt to treat black and female defendants differently. Judges in states with higher levels of racism, as measured by popular support for laws against interracial marriage, are more likely to treat black defendants more harshly than white ones.
The Trump administration has been quite successful in stocking the federal bench with its appointees, and by some estimates the share of Republican appointees on the federal district courts could rise to 50 percent in 2020, from 34 percent in early 2017.
The study said these trends were likely to widen the sentencing gaps.
“Our estimates suggest that a 10 percentage point increase in the share of Republican-appointed judges in each court would increase the racial sentencing gap by approximately 5 percent and the gender sentencing gap by roughly 2 percent,” the authors wrote. “During an average four-year term, a Republican president has the potential to alter the partisan composition of the district courts by over 15 percentage points, potentially increasing the racial and gender sentencing gap by 7.5 and 3 percent, respectively.”
There are a couple of reasons to question that prediction. The Trump administration has been more energetic in appointing appeals court judges than trial judges. And in recent years many conservatives have started to shift positions on sentencing policy. The very scope of the study, which considered sentences imposed from 1999 to 2015, could mask trends in the later years."

","With Democrats furious over Donald Trump, and many Republicans furious over the treatment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the 2018 elections are likely to see the highest turnout of midterm voters in recent history.
But those voters will be confronted by a byzantine array of voter restrictions, voter-suppression efforts, and voter discrimination standing in their way. A review by The Daily Beast found at least five voter-suppression practices in active use today. All are led by Republicans, all have disproportionate effects on non-white populations, and all are rationalized by bogus claims of voter fraud. They include:
Closing polling places in communities of color
Purging eligible voters from the rolls without their knowledge
Barring felons from voting
Voter ID laws
Eliminating early voting
Each one of these alone is troubling. In the aggregate, though, they paint an unmistakable picture of Republican efforts to hold on to power in an increasingly non-white nation by making it harder for non-white people to vote.
Closing polling places
The simplest way to stop people from voting is to make it harder for them to vote, and the easiest way to do that is to close polling places. And since 2013, more than 1,000 polling places have been closed in nine Republican-dominated states alone.
2013 was pivotal for two reasons. First, it came after President Obama’s re-election, which shocked many Republicans and which depended—like Trump’s victory four years later—on new blocs of voters turning out in record numbers. According to Carol Anderson, author of One Person, No Vote: The Impact of Voter Suppression in America, the Obama coalition brought in 15 million new voters, mostly young people and people of color. 2012 was when the demographic writing was on the wall.
Second, 2013 is when the Supreme Court decided Shelby County v. Holder, which eviscerated the Voting Rights Act and made it much easier for states and municipalities to enact discriminatory measures. Prior to Shelby County, states with a history of racial discrimination had to secure advance clearance from the federal government before changing voting processes. But Shelby County did away with those requirements, opening the floodgates to voter suppression. In the case of polling places specifically, pre-Shelby County, states had to notify voters if their polling places had changed, but that requirement was removed in 2013.
Since then, a study by the Leadership Conference Education Fund found that 868 polling places had been closed in Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas. A second study found 214 polling places (8 percent of the state’s total) have been closed since 2012 in Georgia, where Secretary of State Brian Kemp is now the Republican candidate for governor. He’s running in a dead heat with longtime voting rights activist, Democratic state representative Stacey Abrams.)
While there are legitimate budgetary reasons to close polling places, where they are closed tells a different story. In one Georgia county, local election officials announced plans to close seven of nine polling places in an overwhelmingly black area, plans that were stopped after a statewide protest arose. But according to a Pew Institute investigation, “10 counties with large black populations in Georgia closed polling spots after a white elections consultant recommended they do so to save money.”
“ If you fail to vote for two elections, you’re sent a notice, and if you don’t answer the notice, you’re purged from the rolls. ”
As a result of Kemp’s closures, 53 of Georgia’s 159 counties have fewer precincts today than they did in 2012. Of those 53 counties, 39 have poverty rates that are higher than the state average, and 30 have black populations of more than 25 percent. In other words, three-quarters of the counties affected are disproportionately non-white.
John Powers, an attorney with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution: “There’s no doubt that there is a pattern statewide. Many of the counties in which consolidations are being considered have substantial numbers of minority voters. These precinct consolidations have a disparate impact on Georgia’s most vulnerable citizens.”
In sum, the 2018 report of the nonpartisan U.S. Commission on Civil Rights—a massive, 400-page tome based on voluminous statistical data—concluded that in states like Georgia “cuts to polling places resulted in decreased minority-voter access and influence.”
Voter purges
A second common voter-suppression technique is the purge of the voting rolls based on thinner and thinner pretexts. Voter rolls are supposed to be maintained to ensure accuracy, but lately the criteria for being purged, and the difficulty of getting un-purged, have amplified considerably. And as the Commission on Civil Rights report concluded, “voter roll purges often disproportionately affect African-American or Latino-American voters.”
Once again, Georgia and Brian Kemp provide a chilling example. This week, the Associated Press revealed that Kemp has implemented an “exact match” policy that disqualifies voters if their names do not precisely match records held by the Georgia Department of Driver Services or the Social Security Administration. Typos, missing hyphens, or clerical errors cause voters to be purged unless they can prove the purge was in error.
As of Oct. 9, 53,000 voters are in limbo because of this requirement—and 70 percent of them are African Americans, AP reported. Georgia’s population is 32 percent African American.
“ In 1896, the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that the limitations on voting were intended ‘to obstruct the exercise of suffrage by the negro race.’ ”
Moreover, journalist Greg Palast laboriously combed through the list of purged voters and found thousands of names that were erroneously purged, such as people who had moved, or even switched apartments in the same building. Yet unless these voters actively take the step of contacting the state of Georgia, they may not be allowed to vote on Nov. 6.
There’s no doubt as to why Kemp is doing this. In a closed-door session of Republican politicians last July, Kemp said, “The Democrats are working hard. There have been these stories about them, you know, registering all these minority voters that are out there and others that are sitting on the sidelines. If they can do that, they can win these elections in November.”
Kemp cited the risk of voter fraud, but his own office’s investigation in 2014 found only a few dozen potentially fraudulent voter applications among tens of thousands that were investigated. While voter fraud is fake, voter suppression is very real.
With Georgia’s population of 10.4 million and an estimated 50 percent voting rate, those 53,000 purged votes represent a full percentage point of voters, enough to swing this close an election.
A second key instance of voter purge is Ohio, where a Supreme Court decision in June allowed a controversial voter-purge policy: If you fail to vote for two elections, you’re sent a notice; and if you don’t answer the notice, you’re purged from the rolls.
Once again, to get a sense of what that means, check the numbers. In 2016, 2.2 million Ohioans didn’t vote. In 2014, 4.6 million didn’t. If you assume that the 2016 non-voters probably sat out 2014 as well, that means 2.2 million people have now been sent a single mailed notice that they had to send back to get put back on the rolls in time for the 2018 election.
We don’t know how many sent back that notice. We do know that Trump won Ohio in 2016 by 446,821 votes, just one-fifth of those who could be purged. And, once again, the Ohio process disproportionately affects those at or near the poverty line, who may not understand the legalistic notice, or may not receive it because they moved, or may be suspicious of sending any such form back to the government.
Disenfranchising felons
One of the most impactful suppression tactics is a legacy of Jim Crow: barring felons from voting, even after their sentences are complete, as happens in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia—all former Confederate states. As a result, in those states, more than 7 percent of the total voting-age population is disenfranchised because of criminal convictions. (The other states in the South allow felons to vote after completing their sentences, in addition to any probation or parole.)
Today, 6.1 million Americans are denied the right to vote because of current or past felony sentences.
There is ample historical evidence that this policy was racist from the start. In 1896, the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that the limitations on voting were intended “to obstruct the exercise of suffrage by the negro race.” And yet, it remains legal.
As a result, according to a 2016 study by the Sentencing Project, in four states more than one in five black Americans is disenfranchised—Florida (21 percent), Kentucky (26 percent), Tennessee (21 percent), and Virginia (22 percent)—due to policies of mass incarceration, crime rates in communities struggling under economic and racial oppression, inequality of opportunity. No wonder it’s called the “New Jim Crow.”
Florida is now the test case for felon voting. In Florida, felons can only get their voting rights back if they personally petition the state. After his predecessors of both parties expedited the process of restoring voting rights, Republican Gov. Rick Scott (now running for U.S. Senate) implemented an arbitrary, mandatory five-year waiting period for those who have completed felony sentences to be able to vote again. This arbitrary rule was upheld in court last April.
“ For the last 40 years, polling places have matched signatures rather than photographs, enabling people to vote without an ID. But following President Obama’s two victories in 2008 and 2012, that began to change. ”
Consider the numbers once again. As a result of the law and Scott’s extension of it, 1.5 million Florida voters are barred from the polls. Florida’s population is 21 million; its turnout rate in non-presidential elections is around 50 percent. And since the current polls in the Florida gubernatorial election have Democrat Andrew Gillum leading Republican Ron DeSantis by 3 percentage points, that means the margin between them is approximately 300,000 votes.
In other words, the number of disenfranchised voters is five times the current margin in the race.
Moreover, Florida’s policy hits black Americans twice as hard as white folks: In 2016, felon disenfranchisement excluded more than 10 percent of the voting-age population overall, but more than 20 percent of black Americans.
This fall, Florida has a constitutional amendment on the books that would do away with the petition process, and automatically restore voting rights once felons have completed their sentences. A recent poll indicates that 71 percent of Florida voters support the measure.
That is good news for democracy. Granted, to many people, barring felons from voting makes some degree of sense. But why? If you think about it, committing a crime doesn’t mean you’re no longer a citizen—you still have to pay taxes, for example. And crimes ought to be punished by the sentences imposed by juries and judges, not disenfranchisement rules put into place by racist state legislatures in the 19th-century post-Confederacy. It’s not by coincidence that felon voting bans hit minority communities more. It’s by design.
Mandating voter ID
For many people, carrying photo identification is no big deal. I show my ID all the time: to get into the office, to board a plane, to get into a bar.
But that is just not true for everyone. In fact, 3 million Americans lack photo IDs, and because the most common photo ID is a driver’s license, the people least likely to have them are less affluent people in urban areas—disproportionately people of color. That’s why, for the last 40 years, polling places have matched signatures rather than photographs, enabling people to vote without an ID. But following President Obama’s two victories in 2008 and 2012, that began to change. Fifteen states enacted voter-ID laws, again with the false claim that voter fraud was a runaway problem.
In 2016, such laws were struck down by courts in Texas, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. But many other laws persist. And, the Commission on Civil Rights report found, “strict voter-ID laws typically produce the greatest burden for African-American and Latino-American communities” and “correlate with an increased turnout gap between white and minority citizens.”
“ Had early voting not been eliminated, Trump’s victory margin in North Carolina would’ve been just one-fifth of what it was. ”
This week, the Supreme Court allowed North Dakota’s onerous voter-ID law to remain on the books and enforced for the 2018 election cycle. That law requires specific forms of ID and proof of residence, both of which many Native Americans lack. In particular, many Native Americans do not have traditional residential street addresses, meaning they simply cannot comply with the new law.)
The requirements were put into place by Republicans after Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp’s razor-thin victory in 2012, together with a host of other rule changes that make it harder for Native Americans—who make up about 5 percent of the state—to vote. This year, Heitkamp is facing a tough re-election race against a Republican challenger.
Eliminating early voting
America is one of the few democracies where Election Day takes place on a workday, which makes it very hard for parents who have to juggle work and childcare to vote. That, in itself, is a kind of voter suppression.
To compensate, most states have implemented early voting, opening the polls days before Election Day to enable people to vote. After 2008 and 2012, that trend was reversed. In North Carolina, for example, the Republican-controlled legislature and Republican governor eliminated early voting days in 2013, even though in 2012, 900,000 voters cast their ballots during the early-voting window.
Why? Take a look at the numbers. In 2012, 48 percent of North Carolina’s early voters were registered Democrats and 32 percent were registered Republicans; that means that 140,000 more early-voters were Democrats. In 2012, Mitt Romney won the state by 92,004 votes; in 2016, Donald Trump won by just 173,315 votes.
In other words, had early voting not been eliminated, Trump’s victory margin would’ve been just one-fifth of what it was. It would practically have been a tie—and that’s not counting North Carolina’s other voter-suppression efforts.
Another example is Florida, where Gov. Scott rolled back early voting at university campuses, where voters tend to be younger and more liberal. This policy was halted in July by a federal judge, who noted that 830,000 students were enrolled at state colleges and universities. Even so, three Florida universities announced they still would not enable early voting at their campus polling places.
Lying about voter fraud
Now, these five voter-suppression policies don’t even include some of the most insidious disenfranchisement practices happening today: extreme gerrymanders that benefit one party over another, or redistricting efforts that “crack” minority communities into multiple districts or “pack” them all into one, diluting their power. These practices, both of which have recently been allowed to proceed by the conservative-led Supreme Court, arguably weaken the power of minority voters more than voter-suppression campaigns do.
But voter suppression is unique in that it directly blocks voters from voting. It is a direct affront to their citizenship. And it is all based on a lie: that voter fraud is a crisis.
In fact, there simply is no voter-fraud crisis. An exhaustive study by a Loyola law professor found that between 2000 and 2014, there were all of 31 reported instances of in-person voter impersonation. Out of more than a billion votes cast. In other words, the odds are 1 in 32 million that a vote is fraudulent—certainly not enough to swing any election. And by way of comparison, you are 237 times more likely to be struck by lightning.
In the fact-free universe of Fox News, Sinclair, Breitbart, the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal, and the rest, it doesn’t matter that there is no voter-fraud crisis. They’ll just make one up. Remember, the president of the United States has alleged, without a scintilla of evidence, that between 3 and 5 million people voted illegally, a claim that every expert in the field has said is implausible to the point of absurdity.
As a result, three-quarters of Republicans said that voter fraud happens “somewhat” or “very often,” including 68 percent of Republicans said that millions of illegal immigrants had voted in 2016. Both completely, unequivocally false.
Likewise, one would think that the career of Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Republican, would be harmed by his humiliating, devastating losses on the “voter fraud” issue. First, Kobach lost in federal court, when it was found that his anti-fraud crusades, which suspended 36,000 Kansas voters (once again, disproportionately people of color), was totally unjustified. (It found exactly three cases of possible fraud, all of which were mistakes, in which senior citizens voted in two states by accident.) And if that weren’t enough, Kobach was humiliated again on the national stage, when the voter-fraud commission he chaired folded without finding a single case of fraud.
And yet, Kobach is now running for governor of Kansas , and might just win.
If there is a silver lining, it’s that this year there are efforts to turn back the tide. Dale Ho, director of the ACLU Voting Rights Project, told The Daily Beast that “there are more pro-voter ballot initiatives this year than perhaps any election in recent history. These include the restoration of voting rights to people who have served their time in Florida, wholesale modernization of the elections system in Michigan, automatic registration in Nevada, Election Day registration in Maryland, and nonpartisan redistricting in Utah. Voters have a chance to take matters into their own hands.”
Ultimately, the Republican voter-suppression scam is just about math. There are too many black and brown people in the country for the Republican Party to retain power with a narrow base of white support. If there weren’t systemic voter suppression, the states of Texas, Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, and Georgia would likely be Democrat-led today or in the very near future. So what choice to Republicans have but to forestall the inevitable and prevent people of color from voting for as long as they can?
As Ho put it, “the techniques of voter suppression change, but the constant is a continuing push by elected officials whose power is threatened by demographic shifts in the voting populace to try to curate the electorate and boost their chances of retaining power.”
Republican strategist Paul Weyrich said it best in 1980, when he stood beside Ronald Reagan at an evangelical gathering. “I don’t want everyone to vote,” he said then. “Elections are not won by a majority of the people… As a matter of fact, our leverage in the election quite candidly goes up as the voting population goes down. We have no responsibility, moral or otherwise, to turn out our opposition. It’s important to turn out those who are with us.”"

","Bob Woodward’s new book, “Fear,” describes a “nervous breakdown of Trump’s presidency.” Earlier this year, Michael Wolff’s “Fire and Fury” offered a similar portrayal.
Now, an op-ed in The New York Times by an anonymous “senior White House official” describes how deeply the troubles in this administration run and what effort is required to protect the nation.
None of this is a surprise to those of us who, 18 months ago, put together our own public service book, “The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.”
My focus as the volume’s editor was on Trump’s dangerousness because of my area of expertise in violence prevention. Approaching violence as a public health issue, I have consulted with governments and international organizations, in addition to 20 years of engaging in the individual assessment and treatment of violent offenders.
The book proceeded from an ethics conference I held at Yale, my home institution. At that meeting, my psychiatrist colleagues and I discussed balancing two essential duties of our profession. First is the duty to speak responsibly about public officials, especially as outlined in “the Goldwater rule,” which requires that we refrain from diagnosing without a personal examination and without authorization. Second is our responsibility to protect public health and safety, or our “duty to warn” in cases of danger, which usually supersedes other rules.
Our conclusion was overwhelmingly that our responsibility to society and its safety, as outlined in our ethical guidelines, overrode any etiquette owed to a public figure. That decision led to the collection of essays in the book, which includes some of the most prominent thinkers of the field including Robert J. Lifton, Judith Herman, Philip Zimbardo and two dozen others. That decision was controversial among some members of our field.
We already know a great deal about Trump’s mental state based on the voluminous information he has given through his tweets and his responses to real situations in real time. Now, this week’s credible reports support the concerns we articulated in the book beyond any doubt.

The psychology behind the chaos
The author of the New York Times op-ed makes clear that the conflict in the White House is not about Trump’s ideology.
The problem, the author sees, is the lack of “any discernible first principles that guide his decision making … his impulsiveness [that] results in half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back, and there being literally no telling whether he might change his mind from one minute to the next.”
These are obviously psychological symptoms reflective of emotional compulsion, impulsivity, poor concentration, narcissism and recklessness. They are identical to those that Woodward describes in numerous examples, which he writes were met with the “stealthy machinations used by those in Trump’s inner sanctum to try to control his impulses and prevent disasters.”
They are also consistent with the course we foresaw early in Trump’s presidency, which concerned us enough to outline it in our book. We tried to warn that his condition was worse than it appeared, would grow worse over time and would eventually become uncontainable.
What we observed were signs of mental instability – signs that would eventually play out not only in the White House, as these accounts report, but in domestic situations and in the geopolitical sphere.
There is a strong connection between immediate dangerousness – the likelihood of waging a war or launching nuclear weapons – and extended societal dangerousness – policies that force separation of children from families or the restructuring of global relations in a way that would destabilize the world.
Getting worse
My current concern is that we are already witnessing a further unraveling of the president’s mental state, especially as the frequency of his lying increases and the fervor of his rallies intensifies.
I am concerned that his mental challenges could cause him to take unpredictable and potentially extreme and dangerous measures to distract from his legal problems.
Mental health professionals have standard procedures for evaluating dangerousness. More than a personal interview, violence potential is best assessed through past history and a structured checklist of a person’s characteristics.
These characteristics include a history of cruelty to animals or other people, risk taking, behavior suggesting loss of control or impulsivity, narcissistic personality and current mental instability. Also of concern are noncompliance or unwillingness to undergo tests or treatment, access to weapons, poor relationship with significant other or spouse, seeing oneself as a victim, lack of compassion or empathy, and lack of concern over consequences of harmful acts.
The Woodward book and the New York Times op-ed confirm many of these characteristics. The rest have been evident in Trump’s behavior outside the White House and prior to his tenure.
That the president has met not just some but all these criteria should be reason for alarm.
Other ways in which a president could be dangerous are through cognitive symptoms or lapses, since functions such as reasoning, memory, attention, language and learning are critical to the duties of a president. He has exhibited signs of decline here, too.
Furthermore, when someone displays a propensity for large-scale violence, such as by advocating violence against protesters or immigrant families, calling perpetrators of violence such as white supremacists “very fine people” or showing oneself vulnerable to manipulation by hostile foreign powers, then these things can promote a much more widespread culture of violence.
The president has already shown an alarming escalation of irrational behavior during times of distress. Others have observed him to be “unstable,” “losing a step” and “unraveling.” He is likely to enter such a state again.
Violent acts are not random events. They are end products of a long process that follow recognizable patterns. As mental health experts, we make predictions in terms of unacceptable levels of probability rather than on the basis of what is certain to happen.
Trump’s impairment is a familiar pattern to a violence expert such as myself, but given his level of severity, one does not need to be a specialist to know that he is dangerous.
What next?
I believe Woodward’s book and the revelations in the New York Times op-ed have placed great pressure on the president. We are now entering a period when the stresses of the presidency could accelerate because of the advancing special counsel’s investigations.
The degree of Trump’s denial and resistance to the unfolding revelations, as expressed in a recent Fox interview, are telling of his fragility.
From my observations of the president over extended time via his public presentations, direct thoughts through tweets and accounts of his close associates, I believe that the question is not whether he will look for distractions, but how soon and to what degree.
At least several thousands of mental health professionals who are members of the National Coalition of Concerned Mental Health Experts share the view that the nuclear launch codes should not be in the hands of someone who exhibits such levels of mental instability.
Just as suspicion of crime should lead to an investigation, the severity of impairment that we see should lead to an evaluation, preferably with the president’s consent.
Mental impairment should be evaluated independently from criminal investigations, using medical criteria and standardized measures. A sitting president may be immune to indictments, but he is subject to the law, which is strict about public safety and the right to treatment when an individual poses a danger to the public because of mental instability. In the case of danger, the patient does not have the right to refuse, nor does the physician have the right not to take the person as a patient.
This evaluation may have been delayed, but it is still not too late. And mental health professionals have extensive experience assessing, restraining and treating individuals much like Trump – it is almost routine.

","Seems to me I’ve heard this song before, it’s an old familiar score …
Florida, you cannot hide Democratic ballots, count only the Republicans and then say that the counting is over once the Republicans are in the lead.
That’s the rules. Just because you got away with stealing an election in 2000 does not mean you can do it again this year. You have to wait at least 20 years before you steal another one. I think that’s in the rules, too.
If you’ll recall, the last election you stole ended in a crashed economy, banks failing, a couple of wars that cost $4 Trillion dollars and 6,648 American lives and a debt that could choke a horse. So, Florida, you can see why we’re a little anxious about you doing it again.
And then there’s this …
“The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!” Donald Trump
Well, there ya go, Florida. You screwed up the election so Republicans win because they are experts at screwing up.

","President Donald Trump on Thursday spoke for more than an hour at the Republican National Convention — giving him plenty of time to try to spin his presidency’s record positively and, it turns out, get a lot of things wrong.
CNN reporter Daniel Dale, who’s made a name for himself for fact-checking Trump, went on the network with a preliminary fact-check of the president — counting more than 20 false or misleading claims in Trump’s RNC speech, which would amount to one false or misleading claim about every three minutes. Dale proceeded to list those errors on the air, which took three minutes:
“This president is a serial liar, and he serially lied tonight,” Dale said.
Here’s the full list of errors, as recited by Dale:
“Trump said Joe Biden is ‘talking about taking down the border wall.’ Biden has specifically, explicitly rejected that idea. He just said he’ll stop further additional construction.” “Trump claimed, as always, that he is the one who passed the veterans’ choice law. Barack Obama signed that into law in 2014. Trump signed a 2018 law to modify it.” “Trump said, ‘I have done more for the African American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln.’ That is ludicrous. Lyndon Johnson, for one, signed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.” “Trump again touted a ‘record 9 million job gain over the past three months.’ He didn’t mention, as usual, that that gain follows a record 22 million job loss over the previous two months.” “He said he’ll ‘continue to lower drug prices.’ They’ve increased during his presidency.” “He said they opened a Jerusalem embassy for less than $500,000. Early documents show it was at least $21 million.” “He claimed NATO member spending has increased for the first time in about 20 years. Spending, in fact, rose in 2015 and in 2016, before he took office.” “He said he will always, and Republicans will always, strongly protect people with preexisting conditions. That pledge has already been broken. He and they have repeatedly tried to weaken those protections in Obamacare.” “He claimed again that he banned travel from China and Europe. No, he imposed partial restrictions with many exemptions. Tens of thousands of people continued traveling over.” “He boasted about the Covid testing system and about his general response. Look, experts nearly universally say the US was fatally slow in its response, especially slow in setting up adequate testing.” “He said he ended what he called ‘a NAFTA nightmare’ and he signed a brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement — the USMCA. That agreement preserves, maintains most of NAFTA.” “He boasted about building about 300 miles of border wall. What he didn’t say is that most of that is replacement barrier. As of August 7, according to official data, just 5 miles had been built where none existed before.” “He suggested Joe Biden would confiscate guns. That’s baseless. Biden is running on a non-mandatory buyback of so-called assault weapons.” “He said Democrats want to defund the police. Biden, again, doesn’t, has rejected that.” “He said he has ‘very good information’ that China wants Biden to win because Biden is soft on China or cheerleads for China. The US intelligence community says China wants Biden to win because it sees Trump as unpredictable.” “He said Biden vowed to close down charter schools. Biden’s plan is skeptical on charters, but would not abolish them entirely.” “He denounced Biden for voting for the Iraq War. Biden did indeed vote for the Iraq War. But what Trump doesn’t mention is that he also supported that invasion.” “He said Democrats twice removed the word ‘God’ from the Pledge of Allegiance at their convention. Two individual caucus meetings outside the main primetime programming did leave it out, but it was uttered in every primetime event.” “Trump denounced so-called cancel culture as an insidious, left-wing thing. He, Donald J. Trump, has tried to get dozens of people and entities canceled, fired, boycotted, including literally, last week, Goodyear.” “He said he imposed an order to give 10 years in prison to rioters. That’s a maximum discretionary sentence up to judges, in existing laws. His order just asked the government to fully enforce.” “He said Biden’s plan would eliminate America’s borders. No. Just no. It’s wrong.”
It’s quite the list, but this level of lying and misleading isn’t new to Trump. According to the Washington Post, Trump has now made more than 20,000 public false or misleading claims since he assumed office.
As my colleague Matt Yglesias has argued, there’s something more to this than just lying — it’s bullshitting. Here’s Princeton University philosophy professor Harry Frankfurt, explaining the concept:
For the bullshitter, however, all these bets are off: he is neither on the side of the true nor on the side of the false. His eye is not on the facts at all, as the eyes of the honest man and of the liar are, except insofar as they may be pertinent to his interest in getting away with what he says. He does not care whether the things he says describe reality correctly. He just picks them out, or makes them up, to suit his purpose.
It’s not just that Trump is lying. It’s that Trump doesn’t seem to care at all for the truth. What he says is only meant to make him look good. That’s the context in which Trump claims time and time again that he’s passed laws he never passed and built border walls he never built.
And so when the president speaks, it’s perpetually difficult to say if he’s telling the truth or merely reciting self-serving bullshit.

","Disapproval of Donald Trump is at a new high, support for the Mueller investigation is broad and half of Americans in a new ABC News/Washington Post poll favor Congress initiating impeachment proceedings against the president.
Sixty percent in the national survey disapprove of Trump’s performance in office, numerically the highest of his presidency, albeit by a single point; that includes 53 percent who disapprove strongly, more than half for the first time. Thirty-six percent approve, matching his low.
See PDF for full results, charts and tables.
The results come a week after Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was convicted of fraud, and his former longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to eight felonies, including illegal campaign finance actions that he said Trump directed.
Trump’s average approval rating since taking office is the lowest for any president in modern polling since the 1940s. One factor: Contrary to his “drain the swamp” rhetoric, 45 percent say corruption in Washington has increased under Trump, while just 13 percent say it’s declined.
Suspicions of the president relating to the Mueller investigation are substantial. Sixty-one percent say that if assertions by Cohen are true, Trump broke the law. Fifty-three percent also think Trump obstructed special counsel Robert Mueller’s work.
The national survey, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, finds that half the public supports Congress initiating impeachment proceedings against Trump, 49-46 percent; support rises to 57 percent among women. And support for the investigation running its course is broader: Americans overall back Mueller’s probe by 63-29 percent. Fifty-two percent support it strongly, a high level of strong sentiment.
Mueller prosecuted Manafort and referred the Cohen case to federal prosecutors in New York. Support for Mueller’s investigation peaks at 85 percent among Democrats, but also takes in 67 percent of independents and even a third of Republicans (32 percent). Forty-one percent of conservatives back Mueller, rising to more than seven in 10 moderates and liberals.
In Trump’s dispute with Attorney General Jeff Sessions for allowing the investigation to proceed, the public sides with Sessions, 62-23 percent. Sixty-four percent also oppose the idea of Trump firing Sessions; just 19 percent support it.
Further, while Trump has railed against the Manafort prosecution, Americans call it justified by an overwhelming 67-17 percent, including nearly half of Republicans. The public opposes Trump pardoning Manafort by essentially the same margin, 66-18 percent, with 53 percent strongly opposed. Even among Republicans, 45 percent oppose a Manafort pardon; 36 percent support it.
The damage to Trump on these ethics concerns overwhelms his better rating for handling the economy, an essentially even split, 45-47 percent. That demonstrates that a good economy only makes it possible for a president to be popular – it’s no guarantee.
Approval, Groups
The president’s approval rating is highly partisan, but with relative challenges for Trump across the board. His job rating matches his low among Republicans (78 percent approve) and Democrats (6 percent) alike. It’s 35 percent among independents.
He’s at new lows among college-educated Americans (albeit just by a point; 29 percent approve), moderates (24 percent) and blacks (3 percent, with a nearly unanimous 93 percent disapproving).
The single biggest shift is among college-educated white women – just 23 percent now approve of Trump, down 17 points from the peak in April 2017, with disapproval up 20 points, from 55 percent then to 75 percent now. Still, even among non-college white men, a core Trump group, his approval is down 15 points, from 70 percent just this spring to 55 percent today.
Other Group Results
Trump’s approval rating is 12 points lower among women than men, and that gender gap is reflected elsewhere. As noted, 57 percent of women favor Congress initiating impeachment proceedings; that drops to 40 percent of men.
Seventy percent of liberals support impeachment proceedings, declining to 51 percent of moderates and 30 percent of conservatives. Impeachment support is highest, a vast 80 percent, among blacks; 37 percent of whites agree.
Some of these gaps narrow on whether or not the charges against Manafort were justified. Two-thirds of men and women alike say they were, as do two-thirds of whites – including 64 percent of white men without college degrees. Even among Republicans, conservatives and those who approve of Trump’s work in office, more see the charges as justified than as unjustified, by 48-28, 49-30 and 47-29 percent, respectively. (The rest express no opinion.)
As noted, 45 percent of Republicans oppose Trump pardoning Manafort, with 36 percent support. It’s similar among conservatives, 46-34 percent. Trump approvers split about evenly on a Manafort pardon, with 39 percent opposed, 37 percent in favor.
Opposition to a pardon goes higher in other groups – 68 percent among men and 64 percent among women, for example (no real difference between them), 64 percent among whites and Hispanics alike, and 82 percent among blacks.
Sixty-one percent, as noted, say that if Cohen’s claim that he acted at Trump’s direction is true, Trump committed a crime. That view is lowest among Republicans, 28 percent. But there’s concern for Trump in other core groups: A substantial minority of conservatives, 41 percent, say he broke the law if Cohen’s telling the truth. So do 44 percent of evangelical white Protestants, 52 percent of whites and 52 percent of non-college white men, all groups whose support Trump needs.
Methodology
This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Aug. 26-29, 2018, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,003 adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.6 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 33-25-37 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents.
The survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York, N.Y., with sampling, data collection and tabulation by Abt Associates of Rockville, Md. See details on the survey’s methodology here."

Donald Trump’s plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border did not come from security analysts following years of study or through evidence that a wall would reduce illegal immigration. Amazingly, for something so central to the current U.S. president, the wall came about as a “mnemonic device” thought up by a pair of political consultants to remind Donald Trump to talk about illegal immigration.
In 2014, Trump’s plan to run for president moved into high gear. His political confidant was consultant Roger Stone. “Inside Trump’s circle, the power of illegal immigration to manipulate popular sentiment was readily apparent, and his advisers brainstormed methods for keeping their attention-addled boss on message,” writes Joshua Green, author of Devil’s Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Nationalist Uprising. “They needed a trick, a mnemonic device. In the summer of 2014, they found one that clicked.”
Joshua Green had good access to Trump insiders, including Sam Nunberg, who worked with Stone. “Roger Stone and I came up with the idea of ‘the Wall,’ and we talked to Steve [Bannon] about it,” according to Nunberg. “It was to make sure he [Trump] talked about immigration.”
The concept of the Wall did not click right away with the candidate. “Initially, Trump seemed indifferent to the idea,” writes Green. “But in January 2015, he tried it out at the Iowa Freedom Summit, a presidential cattle call put on by David Bossie’s group, Citizens United. ‘One of his pledges was, ‘I will build a Wall,’ and the place just went nuts,’ said Nunberg. Warming to the concept, Trump waited a beat and then added a flourish that brought down the house. ‘Nobody,’ he said, ‘builds like Trump.’”
Roger Stone and Sam Nunberg are political consultants. Neither man has claimed expertise in immigration policy, particularly the complex issue of deterring individuals from attempting to enter the United States illegally. While Stone and Nunberg have their supporters, both have also experienced their share of controversies, including Stone admitting in December 2018, as part of a legal settlement, to “spreading lies” on the Alex Jones InfoWars program.
It should seem strange to base U.S. immigration policy on an idea Roger Stone and Sam Nunberg thought up without any analysis as to whether it represented good policy for the United States. Yet that is what happened – and wall supporters are either unaware or by now have forgotten the reason the wall was proposed in the first place.
Before the end of 2018, Donald Trump rallied enough House Republicans to support $5 billion in funding to help build a wall. That action (and others) resulted in a partial government shutdown. After the shutdown began, Trump tweeted that building a wall is the only effective way to stop illegal immigration into the United States.
In a December 2018 editorial, the Wall Street Journal pointed out building a wall is not the best way to reduce illegal immigration and it represents a questionable use of taxpayer money. “The best solution, as ever, is to reduce the incentive for people to come illegally by creating more ways to work legally in America,” the editorial noted. “Most migrants come to work, and at the current moment there are plenty of unfilled jobs for them. A guest-worker program would let migrants move back and forth legally, ebbing and flowing based on employer needs, while reducing the ability of gangs and smuggler ‘coyotes’ to exploit vulnerable migrants.”
Research from the National Foundation for American Policy supports this view. A large increase in the legal admission of farm workers during the 1950s under the Bracero Program dramatically reduced illegal entry to America. Based on apprehensions at the border, illegal entry to the United States fell by 95% between 1953 and 1959, as farm workers entered legally in larger numbers. As many analysts have pointed out, a wall does not prevent Central Americans from applying for asylum at lawful ports of entry.
Illegal entry by individuals from Mexico has plummeted by more than 90% since FY 2000, according to Border Patrol apprehensions data. Changed demographics and improved economic conditions mean large-scale illegal migration by Mexicans to the U.S. – the original public justification for building a wall – is over. The flow of Central Americans seeking work or asylum is a recent phenomenon driven by poor economic conditions and violence in their home countries that a wall does little to address.
The idea for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border came from political consultants seeking a way to keep Donald Trump’s mind focused on illegal immigration. A reasonable observer might ask if that is a good reason for a wall to be the basis of U.S. immigration policy.

","Tim O'Brien—who penned a 2005 biography about Donald Trump—said Sunday that the emerging raft of legal documents reveal that Donald Trump's presidential campaign was likely a ""criminal conspiracy"" that commited ""criminal acts.""
During MSNBC's Joy AM host Joy Reid asked O'Brien to comment on the growing scandals and investigations surrounding the president, including the special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, hush money payments and a defamation lawsuit by Summer Zervos.
""What we've learnt from this raft of legal documents that have landed in our lap over the last couple of weeks is that there's the very real possibility that the Trump campaign was a criminal conspiracy from its beginnings and that bled into the Trump transition, where various criminal acts might have been committed,"" O'Brien said. ""Now you have the Trump White House dealing with the consequences of all these.""
The biographer and columnist then goes on to dissect Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani's distraction-based defense strategy.
""When you have Rudy Giuliani as the carnival barker, distracting people, focusing only on campaign finance issues, focusing inaccurately on campaign finance issues. It distracts from the larger halo of illegality hanging over this entire Trump team,"" O'Brien continued.
""Trump and his advisers have put out three defenses in the wake of Cohen's sentencing memo. That Michael Cohen cannot be trusted—he is a dishonest narrator—that he was giving the president advice and it wasn't the other way around, and none of it had anything to do with the election.""
""You can pick apart on the fact pattern in all three of those things. Specifically, it had nothing to do with the election and that it was Cohen taking advice from Trump, rather than Trump being the architect of most of these issues,"" the biographer added.
Earlier this week, Cohen, Trump's former attorney, was sentenced to 36 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to multiple federal crimes, including lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and tax fraud. Although Cohen said he knew paying hush money to women who claimed to have affairs with the then-presidential candidate in the lead up to the 2016 election ""was wrong"", he asserted he did so under instruction from Trump.
""Today is one of the most meaningful days of my life. The irony is that today I get my freedom back,"" Cohen said in court. ""Blind loyalty to this man led me to choose a path of darkness over light."""

","Democratic state lawmakers in New Jersey aren’t done seeking President Donald Trump’s tax returns.
Some members of the state Legislature have revived legislation that would require candidates for president and vice president to disclose their tax returns from the previous five years to appear on the ballot in the Garden State.
The bill would also ban New Jersey’s voters in the electoral college from voting for a candidate that did not do so.
That would affect Trump, a Republican who in 2016 became the first presidential candidate in four decades not to release his returns, if he runs for re-election in 2020.
Similar legislation died in 2017 when then-Gov. Chris Christie — a longtime Trump friend and fellow Republican — conditionally vetoed the measure. He called it unconstitutional and dismissed it as a “transparent political stunt masquerading as a bill.”
Christie instead recommended lawmakers expand the state’s Open Public Record Act by removing exemptions for records kept by the state Legislature. They did not concur.
But now, Democrats control not only the Legislature but the governor’s office, since Phil Murphy succeeded Christie last January. Murphy, a frequent Trump critic, is much more likely to sign it into law.
The full Senate and state Assembly would need to pass the bill for it to head to Murphy’s desk.
It’s unclear, however, how much this would hurt Trump, because New Jersey’s 14 electoral votes have gone to Democratic candidates every presidential election since 1988. It could drag down his numbers in the popular vote.
Many other states have introduced similar legislation. And a Democratic congressman from New Jersey, U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-8th Dist., is leading a similar effort in Washington to force Trump’s tax returns to become public.
The effort has been bolstered by Democrats retaking the House after last year’s elections.
Polls show Americans want to see the returns, as well. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sunday shows 60 percent of U.S. residents support their release.

","And somehow, Mr. Trump made the day’s news about his own problems with the news media. He called on journalists “to set a civil tone” and to “stop the endless hostility and constant negative and often false attacks and stories.”
Then Mr. Trump again directed the crowd’s attention to his bipartisan efforts: “By the way, do you see how nice I’m behaving tonight?” he asked. “Have you ever seen this? We’re all behaving very well!”
(Minutes later, the president broached the topic yet again: “I think we will be bipartisan on infrastructure.”)
Still, the performance by Mr. Trump and the slate of Wisconsin Republicans who took the stage here served as further confirmation that, with less than two weeks to go until a round of midterm elections in which the leadership of the House is at stake, not even reports of explosive devices could do much to halt months of highly divisive messaging at campaign rallies.
Mr. Trump did address the reports in his opening remarks, calling the episodes “an attack on our democracy itself” and promising swift justice.
“Such conduct must be fiercely opposed and firmly prosecuted,” the president said. “We want all sides to come together in peace and harmony. We can do it.”
Two other Republicans who took the stage here at an airport hangar in the 4,000-person town of Mosinee began their speeches with a short disclaimer — essentially, terrorism is bad — before denouncing Democrats for their immigration policies and the cost of health care."
Liberal,"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/24/17047880/conservatives-amplified-russian-trolls-more-often-than-liberals
","Conservatives were much more likely than liberals to retweet Russian trolls in the 2016 election, according to a new study from researchers at the University of Southern California released this month. It traced Russian efforts to influence America’s 2016 presidential campaign via Twitter using 45 million election-related tweets generated by 5.7 million users in a one-month period ahead of the election; researchers delved into what information was spread by trolls, who spread it, and how many times those tweets were shared. The study focused on content from the 2,752 now-deactivated Russian troll accounts identified by Congress in November.
The USC researchers found that conservatives retweeted Russian trolls about 31 times more often than liberals and produced 36 times more tweets. Most retweets of the trolls came from two specific states: Tennessee and Texas. Of the accounts analyzed, they estimated that 4.9 percent of liberal-leaning accounts that spread troll content were bots, and 6.2 percent of conservatives ones were bots.
“Although an ideologically broad swath of Twitter users were exposed to Russian trolls in the period leading up to the 2016 US presidential election, it was mainly conservatives who helped amplify their message,” USC researchers Adam Badawy, Emilio Ferrara, and Kristina Lerman wrote.
During the period they examined — September 16 to October 21, 2016 — the researchers found that trolls were producing more conservative content than liberals, but also that conservative users were much more inclined to amplify the message. There were about four times as many Russian trolls posting conservative content as liberal ones, and they produced about 20 times more content, most of which had a right-leaning, pro-Trump agenda. Conservative-leaning Twitter users were picking up what Russian trolls were putting down.
Conservatives tend to fall into the “fake news” trap a little more often than liberals, and there are a multitude of reasons
Another recent study from an Oxford University project on computational propaganda found that on both Twitter and Facebook, Trump supporters and extreme hard-right conservatives consume and share a disproportionate amount of fake news. Researchers looked at three months of social media data leading up to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address and how users interacted with what they deemed “junk news” — 91 sites they identified as having problems with credibility, bias, and professionalism.
“On Twitter, a network of Trump supporters shares the widest range of known junk news sources and circulates more junk news than all the other groups put together,” the researchers wrote. “On Facebook, extreme hard right pages — distinct from Republican pages — share the widest range of known junk news sources and circulate more junk news than all the other audiences put together.” (The study did not delve into Russian propaganda or users.)
That conservatives are seemingly prone to spread content from Russian trolls or junk news isn’t a matter of intelligence — it might be because they are more attuned to threats, even if those threats aren’t real. A study published in the journal Psychological Science (and cited by the Atlantic) found that right-leaning people are often hyper-attuned to what they perceive as potential hazards and tend to believe signs of danger rather than ignore them.
“Conservatives approach the situation from the start with greater reactivity to threat, a greater prior belief to the level of danger in the world, so it is logical for the conservative to take more seriously information about hazards than the liberal does,” Daniel Fessler, the University of California Los Angeles professor behind the study, told the Atlantic’s Olga Khazan.
Other researchers have also found that beyond risk perception, liberals appear to have more of a need to think critically than conservatives. In a conversation with the Washington Post’s Christopher Ingraham, professor Stefan Pfattheicher of Ulm University noted it’s not a question of intelligence, just ways of thinking. “This seems to be more a matter of motivation to process information (or news) in a critical, reflective thinking style than the ability to do so,” he said.
The fake news problem in the United States shows little signs of subsiding. The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida and students speaking out after it gave birth to multiple conspiracy theories online, Vox’s Matt Yglesias noted, many of which took root on the right. (Something similar happened after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.) Right-wing celebrity and former Sheriff David Clarke on Twitter alleged that student organizers were being backed by George Soros; Donald Trump Jr. liked a tweet suggesting the student movement was part of some larger anti-Trump plot at the FBI. And as the New York Times notes, hours after the shooting, Russian bot accounts on Twitter released hundreds of posts to fuel the gun debate.

White House adviser Kellyanne Conway had an awkward moment on TikTok with her teen daughter over freedom of speech.
Claudia Conway, 15, made headlines this week after she shared her political views with the world through a series of TikTok videos, Complex reports.
While her mother is very much pro-Trump, and her father is anti-Trump conservative, George Conway, the high schooler is a liberal activist and supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement.
The Conways, understandably, are not pleased with the media attention that their teen daughter is getting over her stance on certain social issues. The minor and her mother recently sparred on TikTok, with Kellyanne demanding that she end the stream but Claudia refuses.

“You’re literally not letting me use my freedom of speech,” she tells her mom, who appears to keep calm as she insists Claudia “shut it all down,” because “not everyone’s following is well-meaning.”
Watch the moment go down via the YouTube clip below:
George, meanwhile, has demanded all journalists cease communication with the minor.
Taking to Twitter on Friday (July 3), he wrote, “ “To journalists: @kellyannepolls and I do *not* consent to any communications between you and any of our minor children, including our daughter Claudia. So desist.”
The teen claims her parents are trying to silence her by shutting off her phone and pressuring her to delete her social media accounts.
“Please stop supporting my dad because he’s trying to take down my social media accounts too,” she said during the live stream with her famous mother.

“I grew up in a very, very conservative family, so I was only exposed to those views for a very long time. I decided to educate myself and think for myself,” Claudia told Insider
“I’m still a kid, of course. I took the time to educate myself and took the time to branch out and be exposed to other sides and other biases and whatnot. We do get into arguments a lot — I’m not going to lie.”

","They did not believe the 60-vote threshold was essential when it applied to Trump's Supreme Court nominees.
Senate Republicans are mounting an aggressive campaign to keep their power to block nearly all of the new Democratic majority's legislative proposals.
But while they now defend the Senate's filibuster rule as vital for ""bipartisanship,"" they unanimously voted to eliminate it for Supreme Court nominations less than four years ago.
While it only takes a simple majority in the 100-member U.S. Senate to pass legislation, with few exceptions it takes a three-fifths supermajority — 60 votes — to end debate and actually hold a vote. Segregationists long used those cloture rules to block civil rights legislation and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell used them a record-breaking number of times to obstruct President Barack Obama's agenda.
Senate rules would allow just 51 senators to change that 60-vote threshold. After Democrats retook a narrow majority in the chamber on Wednesday, McConnell (R-KY) and his colleagues began demanding Democrats agree in advance not to do so.
Much of their argument has centered on the importance of preserving the super-majority requirement as a way to ensure bipartisan decisions.
But back in April 2017, the 60-vote requirement also applied to Supreme Court nominations. When Donald Trump nominated conservative Neil Gorsuch to the high court, he lacked the needed supermajority to be confirmed.
Rather than find a nominee palatable to a large bipartisan majority, McConnell and every Republican senator voted to change the rules to eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. They then confirmed him on a mostly party-line vote for a lifetime appointment.
That has not stopped many of those same Republican senators from taking the opposite view now.
McConnell is currently blocking an organizing resolution that would allow Senate committees to operate, demanding that he keep his power to block bills.
""Leader McConnell expressed his long-held view that the crucial, longstanding and bipartisan Senate rules concerning the legislative filibuster remain intact, specifically during the power share for the next two years,"" his spokesman told the Associated Press on Tuesday.
""The 60 vote cloture requirement (filibuster rule) requires bipartisanship and provides stability in our laws- something we should all want in a big, diverse country of 330 million people,"" Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) tweeted on Friday.
Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) agreed, tweeting on Friday, ""Senate GOP majority fended off calls to end legislative filibuster incl from Pres Trump We didn’t cave 2pressure 2go 'nuclear' on legis filibuster bc we knew weight of keeping Senate the gr8 deliberative body Framers of Constitution intended Its time for Senate Democrats 2do same.""
On Thursday, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) tweeted a years-old quote from Biden explaining the rationale for the filibuster rule, opining, ""Makes sense to me!""
According to a Politico report on Thursday, Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) backed McConnell's efforts to force Democrats to keep the rule, saying, ""You want to do it before there's an emotional, difficult, controversial issue. So that it isn’t issue-driven, it's institution-driven.""
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told the outlet that his party needs Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to say ""we're not going to change the legislative filibuster.""
Sens. McConnell, Cornyn, Grassley, Rubio, Collins, and Graham all voted for the 2017 rule change.

","The Times obtained Donald Trump’s tax information extending over more than two decades, revealing struggling properties, vast write-offs, an audit battle and hundreds of millions in debt coming due.
Donald J. Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency. In his first year in the White House, he paid another $750.
He had paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years — largely because he reported losing much more money than he made.
As the president wages a re-election campaign that polls say he is in danger of losing, his finances are under stress, beset by losses and hundreds of millions of dollars in debt coming due that he has personally guaranteed. Also hanging over him is a decade-long audit battle with the Internal Revenue Service over the legitimacy of a $72.9 million tax refund that he claimed, and received, after declaring huge losses. An adverse ruling could cost him more than $100 million.
The tax returns that Mr. Trump has long fought to keep private tell a story fundamentally different from the one he has sold to the American public. His reports to the I.R.S. portray a businessman who takes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year yet racks up chronic losses that he aggressively employs to avoid paying taxes. Now, with his financial challenges mounting, the records show that he depends more and more on making money from businesses that put him in potential and often direct conflict of interest with his job as president.
The New York Times has obtained tax-return data extending over more than two decades for Mr. Trump and the hundreds of companies that make up his business organization, including detailed information from his first two years in office. It does not include his personal returns for 2018 or 2019. This article offers an overview of The Times’s findings; additional articles will be published in the coming weeks.
The returns are some of the most sought-after, and speculated-about, records in recent memory. In Mr. Trump’s nearly four years in office — and across his endlessly hyped decades in the public eye — journalists, prosecutors, opposition politicians and conspiracists have, with limited success, sought to excavate the enigmas of his finances. By their very nature, the filings will leave many questions unanswered, many questioners unfulfilled. They comprise information that Mr. Trump has disclosed to the I.R.S., not the findings of an independent financial examination. They report that Mr. Trump owns hundreds of millions of dollars in valuable assets, but they do not reveal his true wealth. Nor do they reveal any previously unreported connections to Russia.
In response to a letter summarizing The Times’s findings, Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said that “most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate” and requested the documents on which they were based. After The Times declined to provide the records, in order to protect its sources, Mr. Garten took direct issue only with the amount of taxes Mr. Trump had paid.
“Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015,” Mr. Garten said in a statement.
With the term “personal taxes,” however, Mr. Garten appears to be conflating income taxes with other federal taxes Mr. Trump has paid — Social Security, Medicare and taxes for his household employees. Mr. Garten also asserted that some of what the president owed was “paid with tax credits,” a misleading characterization of credits, which reduce a business owner’s income-tax bill as a reward for various activities, like historic preservation.
The tax data examined by The Times provides a road map of revelations, from write-offs for the cost of a criminal defense lawyer and a mansion used as a family retreat to a full accounting of the millions of dollars the president received from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.
Together with related financial documents and legal filings, the records offer the most detailed look yet inside the president’s business empire. They reveal the hollowness, but also the wizardry, behind the self-made-billionaire image — honed through his star turn on “The Apprentice” — that helped propel him to the White House and that still undergirds the loyalty of many in his base.
Ultimately, Mr. Trump has been more successful playing a business mogul than being one in real life.
“The Apprentice,” along with the licensing and endorsement deals that flowed from his expanding celebrity, brought Mr. Trump a total of $427.4 million, The Times’s analysis of the records found. He invested much of that in a collection of businesses, mostly golf courses, that in the years since have steadily devoured cash — much as the money he secretly received from his father financed a spree of quixotic overspending that led to his collapse in the early 1990s.

Indeed, his financial condition when he announced his run for president in 2015 lends some credence to the notion that his long-shot campaign was at least in part a gambit to reanimate the marketability of his name.
As the legal and political battles over access to his tax returns have intensified, Mr. Trump has often wondered aloud why anyone would even want to see them. “There’s nothing to learn from them,” he told The Associated Press in 2016. There is far more useful information, he has said, in the annual financial disclosures required of him as president — which he has pointed to as evidence of his mastery of a flourishing, and immensely profitable, business universe.
In fact, those public filings offer a distorted picture of his financial state, since they simply report revenue, not profit. In 2018, for example, Mr. Trump announced in his disclosure that he had made at least $434.9 million. The tax records deliver a very different portrait of his bottom line: $47.4 million in losses.
Tax records do not have the specificity to evaluate the legitimacy of every business expense Mr. Trump claims to reduce his taxable income — for instance, without any explanation in his returns, the general and administrative expenses at his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey increased fivefold from 2016 to 2017. And he has previously bragged that his ability to get by without paying taxes “makes me smart,” as he said in 2016. But the returns, by his own account, undercut his claims of financial acumen, showing that he is simply pouring more money into many businesses than he is taking out.
The picture that perhaps emerges most starkly from the mountain of figures and tax schedules prepared by Mr. Trump’s accountants is of a businessman-president in a tightening financial vise.
Most of Mr. Trump’s core enterprises — from his constellation of golf courses to his conservative-magnet hotel in Washington — report losing millions, if not tens of millions, of dollars year after year.
Listen to This Article
His revenue from “The Apprentice” and from licensing deals is drying up, and several years ago he sold nearly all the stocks that now might have helped him plug holes in his struggling properties.
The tax audit looms.
And within the next four years, more than $300 million in loans — obligations for which he is personally responsible — will come due.
Against that backdrop, the records go much further toward revealing the actual and potential conflicts of interest created by Mr. Trump’s refusal to divest himself of his business interests while in the White House. His properties have become bazaars for collecting money directly from lobbyists, foreign officials and others seeking face time, access or favor; the records for the first time put precise dollar figures on those transactions.
At the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., a flood of new members starting in 2015 allowed him to pocket an additional $5 million a year from the business. In 2017, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association paid at least $397,602 to the Washington hotel, where the group held at least one event during its four-day World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians.
The Times was also able to take the fullest measure to date of the president’s income from overseas, where he holds ultimate sway over American diplomacy. When he took office, Mr. Trump said he would pursue no new foreign deals as president. Even so, in his first two years in the White House, his revenue from abroad totaled $73 million. And while much of that money was from his golf properties in Scotland and Ireland, some came from licensing deals in countries with authoritarian-leaning leaders or thorny geopolitics — for example, $3 million from the Philippines, $2.3 million from India and $1 million from Turkey.
In the Philippines, where Mr. Trump licensed his name to a Manila tower, he or his companies paid $156,824 in taxes in 2017. Hannah Reyes Morales for The New York Times
He reported paying taxes, in turn, on a number of his overseas ventures. In 2017, the president’s $750 contribution to the operations of the U.S. government was dwarfed by the $15,598 he or his companies paid in Panama, the $145,400 in India and the $156,824 in the Philippines.
The $750 Tax Bill Here’s how his accountants arrived at that figure in 2017.
Mr. Trump’s U.S. payment, after factoring in his losses, was roughly equivalent, in dollars not adjusted for inflation, to another presidential tax bill revealed nearly a half-century before. In 1973, The Providence Journal reported that, after a charitable deduction for donating his presidential papers, Richard M. Nixon had paid $792.81 in 1970 on income of about $200,000.
The leak of Mr. Nixon’s small tax payment caused a precedent-setting uproar: Henceforth, presidents, and presidential candidates, would make their tax returns available for the American people to see.
A Map of the Empire
The contents of thousands of personal and business tax records fill in financial details that have been withheld for years.
“I would love to do that,” Mr. Trump said in 2014 when asked whether he would release his taxes if he ran for president. He’s been backpedaling ever since.
When he ran, he said he might make his taxes public if Hillary Clinton did the same with the deleted emails from her private server — an echo of his taunt, while stoking the birther fiction, that he might release the returns if President Barack Obama released his birth certificate. He once boasted that his tax returns were “very big” and “beautiful.” But making them public? “It’s very complicated.” He often claims that he cannot do so while under audit — an argument refuted by his own I.R.S. commissioner. When prosecutors and congressional investigators issued subpoenas for his returns, he wielded not just his private lawyers but also the power of his Justice Department to stalemate them all the way to the Supreme Court.
Mr. Trump’s elaborate dance and defiance have only stoked suspicion about what secrets might lie hidden in his taxes. Is there a financial clue to his deference to Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin? Did he write off as a business expense the hush-money payment to the pornographic film star Stormy Daniels in the days before the 2016 election? Did a covert source of money feed his frenzy of acquisition that began in the mid-2000s?
The Times examined and analyzed the data from thousands of individual and business tax returns for 2000 through 2017, along with additional tax information from other years. The trove included years of employee compensation information and records of cash payments between the president and his businesses, as well as information about ongoing federal audits of his taxes. This article also draws upon dozens of interviews and previously unreported material from other sources, both public and confidential.
All of the information The Times obtained was provided by sources with legal access to it. While most of the tax data has not previously been made public, The Times was able to verify portions of it by comparing it with publicly available information and confidential records previously obtained by The Times.
To delve into the records is to see up close the complex structure of the president’s business interests — and the depth of his entanglements. What is popularly known as the Trump Organization is in fact a collection of more than 500 entities, virtually all of them wholly owned by Mr. Trump, many carrying his name. For example, 105 of them are a variation of the name Trump Marks, which he uses for licensing deals.
Fragments of Mr. Trump’s tax returns have leaked out before.
Transcripts of his main federal tax form, the 1040, from 1985 to 1994, were obtained by The Times in 2019. They showed that, in many years, Mr. Trump lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer. Three pages of his 1995 returns, mailed anonymously to The Times during the 2016 campaign, showed that Mr. Trump had declared losses of $915.7 million, giving him a tax deduction that could have allowed him to avoid federal income taxes for almost two decades. Five months later, the journalist David Cay Johnston obtained two pages of Mr. Trump’s returns from 2005; that year, his fortunes had rebounded to the point that he was paying taxes.
In 1995, the year Mr. Trump broke ground on the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York, he would declare losses of $915.7 million — a sum so large, it could be carried forward to cancel out taxable income for years.

The vast new trove of information analyzed by The Times completes the recurring pattern of ascent and decline that has defined the president’s career. Even so, it has its limits.
Tax returns do not, for example, record net worth — in Mr. Trump’s case, a topic of much posturing and almost as much debate. The documents chart a great churn of money, but while returns report debts, they often do not identify lenders.
The data contains no new revelations about the $130,000 payment to Stephanie Clifford, the actress who performs as Stormy Daniels — a focus of the Manhattan district attorney’s subpoena for Mr. Trump’s tax returns and other financial information. Mr. Trump has acknowledged reimbursing his former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who made the payoff, but the materials obtained by The Times did not include any itemized payments to Mr. Cohen. The amount, however, could have been improperly included in legal fees written off as a business expense, which are not required to be itemized on tax returns.
No subject has provoked more intense speculation about Mr. Trump’s finances than his connection to Russia. While the tax records revealed no previously unknown financial connection — and, for the most part, lack the specificity required to do so — they did shed new light on the money behind the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, a subject of enduring intrigue because of subsequent investigations into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.
The records show that the pageant was the most profitable Miss Universe during Mr. Trump’s time as co-owner, and that it generated a personal payday of $2.3 million — made possible, at least in part, by the Agalarov family, who would later help set up the infamous 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials seeking “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton and a Russian lawyer connected to the Kremlin.
In August, the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report that looked extensively into the circumstances of the Moscow pageant, and revealed that as recently as February, investigators subpoenaed the Russian singer Emin Agalarov, who was involved in planning it. Mr. Agalarov’s father, Aras, a billionaire who boasts of close ties to Mr. Putin, was Mr. Trump’s partner in the event.

The committee interviewed a top Miss Universe executive, Paula Shugart, who said the Agalarovs offered to underwrite the event; their family business, Crocus Group, paid a $6 million licensing fee and another $6 million in expenses. But while the pageant proved to be a financial loss for the Agalarovs — they recouped only $2 million — Ms. Shugart told investigators that it was “one of the most lucrative deals” the Miss Universe organization ever made, according to the report.
That is borne out by the tax records. They show that in 2013, the pageant reported $31.6 million in gross receipts — the highest since at least the 1990s — allowing Mr. Trump and his co-owner, NBC, to split profits of $4.7 million. By comparison, Mr. Trump and NBC shared losses of $2 million from the pageant the year before the Moscow event, and $3.8 million from the one the year after.
Loser, Winner
Losses reported by businesses Mr. Trump owns and runs helped wipe out tax bills on hundreds of millions of dollars in celebrity income.
While Mr. Trump crisscrossed the country in 2015 describing himself as uniquely qualified to be president because he was “really rich” and had “built a great company,” his accountants back in New York were busy putting the finishing touches on his 2014 tax return.
After tabulating all the profits and losses from Mr. Trump’s various endeavors on Form 1040, the accountants came to Line 56, where they had to enter the total income tax the candidate was required to pay. They needed space for only a single figure.
Zero.
For Mr. Trump, that bottom line must have looked familiar. It was the fourth year in a row that he had not paid a penny of federal income taxes.
Mr. Trump’s avoidance of income taxes is one of the most striking discoveries in his tax returns, especially given the vast wash of income itemized elsewhere in those filings.
Mr. Trump’s net income from his fame — his 50 percent share of “The Apprentice,” together with the riches showered upon him by the scores of suitors paying to use his name — totaled $427.4 million through 2018. A further $176.5 million in profit came to him through his investment in two highly successful office buildings.
So how did he escape nearly all taxes on that fortune? Even the effective tax rate paid by the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans could have caused him to pay more than $100 million.
The answer rests in a third category of Mr. Trump’s endeavors: businesses that he owns and runs himself. The collective and persistent losses he reported from them largely absolved him from paying federal income taxes on the $600 million from “The Apprentice,” branding deals and investments.
That equation is a key element of the alchemy of Mr. Trump’s finances: using the proceeds of his celebrity to purchase and prop up risky businesses, then wielding their losses to avoid taxes.
Throughout his career, Mr. Trump’s business losses have often accumulated in sums larger than could be used to reduce taxes on other income in a single year. But the tax code offers a workaround: With some restrictions, business owners can carry forward leftover losses to reduce taxes in future years.
That provision has been the background music to Mr. Trump’s life. As The Times’s previous reporting on his 1995 return showed, the nearly $1 billion in losses from his early-1990s collapse generated a tax deduction that he could use for up to 18 years going forward.
The newer tax returns show that Mr. Trump burned through the last of the tax-reducing power of that $1 billion in 2005, just as a torrent of entertainment riches began coming his way following the debut of “The Apprentice” the year before.
For 2005 through 2007, cash from licensing deals and endorsements filled Mr. Trump’s bank accounts with $120 million in pure profit. With no prior-year losses left to reduce his taxable income, he paid substantial federal income taxes for the first time in his life: a total of $70.1 million.
As his celebrity income swelled, Mr. Trump went on a buying spree unlike any he had had since the 1980s, when eager banks and his father’s wealth allowed him to buy or build the casinos, airplanes, yacht and old hotel that would soon lay him low.
When “The Apprentice” premiered, Mr. Trump had opened only two golf courses and was renovating two more. By the end of 2015, he had 15 courses and was transforming the Old Post Office building in Washington into a Trump International Hotel. But rather than making him wealthier, the tax records reveal as never before, each new acquisition only fed the downward draft on his bottom line.
Consider the results at his largest golf resort, Trump National Doral, near Miami. Mr. Trump bought the resort for $150 million in 2012; through 2018, his losses have totaled $162.3 million. He has pumped $213 million of fresh cash into Doral, tax records show, and has a $125 million mortgage balance coming due in three years.

His three courses in Europe — two in Scotland and one in Ireland — have reported a combined $63.6 million in losses.
Over all, since 2000, Mr. Trump has reported losses of $315.6 million at the golf courses that are his prized possessions.
For all of its Trumpworld allure, his Washington hotel, opened in 2016, has not fared much better. Its tax records show losses through 2018 of $55.5 million.
And Trump Corporation, a real estate services company, has reported losing $134 million since 2000. Mr. Trump personally bankrolled the losses year after year, marking his cash infusions as a loan with an ever-increasing balance, his tax records show. In 2016, he gave up on getting paid back and turned the loan into a cash contribution.
Mr. Trump has often posited that his losses are more accounting magic than actual money out the door.
Last year, after The Times published details of his tax returns from the 1980s and 1990s, he attributed the red ink to depreciation, which he said in a tweet would show “losses in almost all cases” and that “much was non monetary.”
“I love depreciation,” Mr. Trump said during a presidential debate in 2016.
Depreciation, though, is not a magic wand — it involves real money spent or borrowed to buy buildings or other assets that are expected to last years. Those costs must be spread out as expenses and deducted over the useful life of the asset. Even so, the rules do hold particular advantages for real estate developers like Mr. Trump, who are allowed to use their real estate losses to reduce their taxable income from other activities.
What the tax records for Mr. Trump’s businesses show, however, is that he has lost chunks of his fortune even before depreciation is figured in. The three European golf courses, the Washington hotel, Doral and Trump Corporation reported losing a total of $150.3 million from 2010 through 2018, without including depreciation as an expense.
To see what a successful business looks like, depreciation or not, look no further than one in Mr. Trump’s portfolio that he does not manage.
After plans for a Trump-branded mini-city on the Far West Side of Manhattan stalled in the 1990s, Mr. Trump’s stake was sold by his partner to Vornado Realty Trust. Mr. Trump objected to the sale in court, saying he had not been consulted, but he ended up with a 30 percent share of two valuable office buildings owned and operated by Vornado.
His share of the profits through the end of 2018 totaled $176.5 million, with depreciation factored in. He has never had to invest more money in the partnership, tax records show.
Among businesses he runs, Mr. Trump’s first success remains his best. The retail and commercial spaces at Trump Tower, completed in 1983, have reliably delivered more than $20 million a year in profits, a total of $336.3 million since 2000 that has done much to help keep him afloat.
Mr. Trump has an established track record of stiffing his lenders. But the tax returns reveal that he has failed to pay back far more money than previously known: a total of $287 million since 2010.
The I.R.S. considers forgiven debt to be income, but Mr. Trump was able to avoid taxes on much of that money by reducing his ability to declare future business losses. For the rest, he took advantage of a provision of the Great Recession bailout that allowed income from canceled debt to be completely deferred for five years, then spread out evenly over the next five. He declared the first $28.2 million in 2014.
Once again, his business losses mostly absolved his tax responsibilities. He paid no federal income taxes for 2014.
Mr. Trump was periodically required to pay a parallel income tax called the alternative minimum tax, created as a tripwire to prevent wealthy people from using huge deductions, including business losses, to entirely wipe out their tax liabilities.
Mr. Trump paid alternative minimum tax in seven years between 2000 and 2017 — a total of $24.3 million, excluding refunds he received after filing. For 2015, he paid $641,931, his first payment of any federal income tax since 2010.
As he settled into the Oval Office, his tax bills soon returned to form. His potential taxable income in 2016 and 2017 included $24.8 million in profits from sources related to his celebrity status and $56.4 million for the loans he did not repay. The dreaded alternative minimum tax would let his business losses erase only some of his liability.
Each time, he requested an extension to file his 1040; and each time, he made the required payment to the I.R.S. for income taxes he might owe — $1 million for 2016 and $4.2 million for 2017. But virtually all of that liability was washed away when he eventually filed, and most of the payments were rolled forward to cover potential taxes in future years.
To cancel out the tax bills, Mr. Trump made use of $9.7 million in business investment credits, at least some of which related to his renovation of the Old Post Office hotel, which qualified for a historic-preservation tax break. Although he had more than enough credits to owe no taxes at all, his accountants appear to have carved out an allowance for a small tax liability for both 2016 and 2017.
When they got to line 56, the one for income taxes due, the amount was the same each year: $750.
The $72.9 Million Maneuver
“The Apprentice” created what was probably the biggest income tax bite of Mr. Trump’s life. During the Great Recession bailout, he asked for the money back.
Testifying before Congress in February 2019, the president’s estranged personal lawyer, Mr. Cohen, recalled Mr. Trump’s showing him a huge check from the U.S. Treasury some years earlier and musing “that he could not believe how stupid the government was for giving someone like him that much money back.”
In fact, confidential records show that starting in 2010 he claimed, and received, an income tax refund totaling $72.9 million — all the federal income tax he had paid for 2005 through 2008, plus interest.
The legitimacy of that refund is at the center of the audit battle that he has long been waging, out of public view, with the I.R.S.
The records that The Times reviewed square with the way Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited, without explanation, an ongoing audit as grounds for refusing to release his tax returns. He alluded to it as recently as July on Fox News, when he told Sean Hannity, “They treat me horribly, the I.R.S., horribly.”
And while the records do not lay out all the details of the audit, they match his lawyers’ statement during the 2016 campaign that audits of his returns for 2009 and subsequent years remained open, and involved “transactions or activities that were also reported on returns for 2008 and earlier.”
Mr. Trump harvested that refund bonanza by declaring huge business losses — a total of $1.4 billion from his core businesses for 2008 and 2009 — that tax laws had prevented him from using in prior years.
But to turn that long arc of failure into a giant refund check, he relied on some deft accounting footwork and an unwitting gift from an unlikely source — Mr. Obama.
Business losses can work like a tax-avoidance coupon: A dollar lost on one business reduces a dollar of taxable income from elsewhere. The types and amounts of income that can be used in a given year vary, depending on an owner’s tax status. But some losses can be saved for later use, or even used to request a refund on taxes paid in a prior year.
Until 2009, those coupons could be used to wipe away taxes going back only two years. But that November, the window was more than doubled by a little-noticed provision in a bill Mr. Obama signed as part of the Great Recession recovery effort. Now business owners could request full refunds of taxes paid in the prior four years, and 50 percent of those from the year before that.
Mr. Trump had paid no income taxes in 2008. But the change meant that when he filed his taxes for 2009, he could seek a refund of not just the $13.3 million he had paid in 2007, but also the combined $56.9 million paid in 2005 and 2006, when “The Apprentice” created what was likely the biggest income tax bite of his life.
The records reviewed by The Times indicate that Mr. Trump filed for the first of several tranches of his refund several weeks later, in January 2010. That set off what tax professionals refer to as a “quickie refund,” a check processed in 90 days on a tentative basis, pending an audit by the I.R.S.
His total federal income tax refund would eventually grow to $70.1 million, plus $2,733,184 in interest. He also received $21.2 million in state and local refunds, which often piggyback on federal filings.
Whether Mr. Trump gets to keep the cash, though, remains far from a sure thing.
Refunds require the approval of I.R.S. auditors and an opinion of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, a bipartisan panel better known for reviewing the impact of tax legislation. Tax law requires the committee to weigh in on all refunds larger than $2 million to individuals.
Records show that the results of an audit of Mr. Trump’s refund were sent to the joint committee in the spring of 2011. An agreement was reached in late 2014, the documents indicate, but the audit resumed and grew to include Mr. Trump’s returns for 2010 through 2013. In the spring of 2016, with Mr. Trump closing in on the Republican nomination, the case was sent back to the committee. It has remained there, unresolved, with the statute of limitations repeatedly pushed forward.
Precisely why the case has stalled is not clear. But experts say it suggests that the gap between the sides remains wide. If negotiations were to deadlock, the case would move to federal court, where it could become a matter of public record.
The dispute may center on a single claim that jumps off the page of Mr. Trump’s 2009 tax return: a declaration of more than $700 million in business losses that he had not been allowed to use in prior years. Unleashing that giant tax-avoidance coupon enabled him to receive some or all of his refund.
The material obtained by The Times does not identify the business or businesses that generated those losses. But the losses were a kind that can be claimed only when partners give up their interest in a business. And in 2009, Mr. Trump parted ways with a giant money loser: his long-failing Atlantic City casinos.
Mr. Trump announced in 2009 that he was abandoning his stake in his Atlantic City casino business. Mark Makela for The New York Times
After Mr. Trump’s bondholders rebuffed his offer to buy them out, and with a third round of bankruptcy only a week away, Mr. Trump announced in February 2009 that he was quitting the board of directors.
“If I’m not going to run it, I don’t want to be involved in it,” he told The Associated Press. “I’m one of the largest developers in the world. I have a lot of cash and plenty of places I can go.”
The same day, he notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that he had “determined that his partnership interests are worthless and lack potential to regain value” and was “hereby abandoning” his stake.
The language was crucial. Mr. Trump was using the precise wording of I.R.S. rules governing the most beneficial, and perhaps aggressive, method for business owners to avoid taxes when separating from a business.
A partner who walks away from a business with nothing — what tax laws refer to as abandonment — can suddenly declare all the losses on the business that could not be used in prior years. But there are a few catches, including this: Abandonment is essentially an all-or-nothing proposition. If the I.R.S. learns that the owner received anything of value, the allowable losses are reduced to just $3,000 a year.
And Mr. Trump does appear to have received something. When the casino bankruptcy concluded, he got 5 percent of the stock in the new company. The materials reviewed by The Times do not make clear whether Mr. Trump’s refund application reflected his public declaration of abandonment. If it did, that 5 percent could place his entire refund in question.
If the auditors ultimately disallow Mr. Trump’s $72.9 million federal refund, he will be forced to return that money with interest, and possibly penalties, a total that could exceed $100 million. He could also be ordered to return the state and local refunds based on the same claims.
In response to a question about the audit, Mr. Garten, the Trump Organization lawyer, said facts cited by The Times were incorrect, without citing specifics. He did, however, write that it was “illogical” to say Mr. Trump had not paid taxes for those three years just because the money was later refunded.
“While you claim that President Trump paid no taxes in 10 of the 15 previous years,” Mr. Garten said, “you also assert that President Trump claimed a massive refund for tens of millions for taxes he did pay. These two claims are entirely inconsistent and, in any event, not supported by the facts.”
House Democrats who have been in hot pursuit of Mr. Trump’s tax returns most likely have no idea that at least some of the records are sitting in a congressional office building. George Yin, a former chief of staff for the joint committee, said that any identifying information about taxpayers under review was tightly held among a handful of staff lawyers and was rarely shared with politicians assigned to the committee.
It is possible that the case has been paused because Mr. Trump is president, which would raise the personal stakes of re-election. If the recent Fox interview is any indication, Mr. Trump seems increasingly agitated about the matter.
“It’s a disgrace what’s happened,” he told Mr. Hannity. “We had a deal done. In fact, it was — I guess it was signed even. And once I ran, or once I won, or somewhere back a long time ago, everything was like, ‘Well, let’s start all over again.’ It’s a disgrace.”
The 20 Percent Solution
Helping to reduce Mr. Trump’s tax bills are unidentified consultants’ fees, some of which can be matched to payments received by Ivanka Trump.
Examining the Trump Organization’s tax records, a curious pattern emerges: Between 2010 and 2018, Mr. Trump wrote off some $26 million in unexplained “consulting fees” as a business expense across nearly all of his projects.
In most cases the fees were roughly one-fifth of his income: In Azerbaijan, Mr. Trump collected $5 million on a hotel deal and reported $1.1 million in consulting fees, while in Dubai it was $3 million with a $630,000 fee, and so on.
Mysterious big payments in business deals can raise red flags, particularly in places where bribes or kickbacks to middlemen are routine. But there is no evidence that Mr. Trump, who mostly licenses his name to other people’s projects and is not involved in securing government approvals, has engaged in such practices.
Rather, there appears to be a closer-to-home explanation for at least some of the fees: Mr. Trump reduced his taxable income by treating a family member as a consultant, and then deducting the fee as a cost of doing business.
The “consultants” are not identified in the tax records. But evidence of this arrangement was gleaned by comparing the confidential tax records to the financial disclosures Ivanka Trump filed when she joined the White House staff in 2017. Ms. Trump reported receiving payments from a consulting company she co-owned, totaling $747,622, that exactly matched consulting fees claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization for hotel projects in Vancouver and Hawaii.

Jonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press
Ms. Trump had been an executive officer of the Trump companies that received profits from and paid the consulting fees for both projects — meaning she appears to have been treated as a consultant on the same hotel deals that she helped manage as part of her job at her father’s business.
When asked about the arrangement, the Trump Organization lawyer, Mr. Garten, did not comment.
Employers can deduct consulting fees as a business expense and also avoid the withholding taxes that apply to wages. To claim the deduction, the consulting arrangement must be an “ordinary and necessary” part of running the business, with fees that are reasonable and market-based, according to the I.R.S. The recipient of the fees is still required to pay income tax.
The I.R.S. has pursued civil penalties against some business owners who devised schemes to avoid taxes by paying exorbitant fees to related parties who were not in fact independent contractors. A 2011 tax court case centered on the I.R.S.’s denial of almost $3 million in deductions for consulting fees the partners in an Illinois accounting firm paid themselves via corporations they created. The court concluded that the partners had structured the fees to “distribute profits, not to compensate for services.”
There is no indication that the I.R.S. has questioned Mr. Trump’s practice of deducting millions of dollars in consulting fees. If the payments to his daughter were compensation for work, it is not clear why Mr. Trump would do it in this form, other than to reduce his own tax liability. Another, more legally perilous possibility is that the fees were a way to transfer assets to his children without incurring a gift tax.
A Times investigation in 2018 found that Mr. Trump’s late father, Fred Trump, employed a number of legally dubious schemes decades ago to evade gift taxes on millions of dollars he transferred to his children. It is not possible to discern from this newer collection of tax records whether intra-family financial maneuverings were a motivating factor.
However, the fact that some of the consulting fees are identical to those reported by Mr. Trump’s daughter raises the question of whether this was a mechanism the president used to compensate his adult children involved with his business. Indeed, in some instances where large fees were claimed, people with direct knowledge of the projects were not aware of any outside consultants who would have been paid.
On the failed hotel deal in Azerbaijan, which was plagued by suspicions of corruption, a Trump Organization lawyer told The New Yorker the company was blameless because it was merely a licenser and had no substantive role, adding, “We did not pay any money to anyone.” Yet, the tax records for three Trump L.L.C.s involved in that project show deductions for consulting fees totaling $1.1 million that were paid to someone.
In Turkey, a person directly involved in developing two Trump towers in Istanbul expressed bafflement when asked about consultants on the project, telling The Times there was never any consultant or other third party in Turkey paid by the Trump Organization. But tax records show regular deductions for consulting fees over seven years totaling $2 million.
Ms. Trump disclosed in her public filing that the fees she received were paid through TTT Consulting L.L.C., which she said provided “consulting, licensing and management services for real estate projects.” Incorporated in Delaware in December 2005, the firm is one of several Trump-related entities with some variation of TTT or TTTT in the name that appear to refer to members of the Trump family.
Like her brothers Donald Jr. and Eric, Ms. Trump was a longtime employee of the Trump Organization and an executive officer for more than 200 Trump companies that licensed or managed hotel and resort properties. The tax records show that the three siblings had each drawn a salary from their father’s company — roughly $480,000 a year, jumping to about $2 million after Mr. Trump became president — though Ms. Trump no longer receives a salary. What’s more, Mr. Trump has said the children were intimately involved in negotiating and managing his projects. When asked in a 2011 lawsuit deposition whom he relied on to handle important details of his licensing deals, he named only Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric.
On Ms. Trump’s now-defunct website, which explains her role at the Trump Organization, she was not identified as a consultant. Rather, she has been described as a senior executive who “actively participates in all aspects of both Trump and Trump branded projects, including deal evaluation, predevelopment planning, financing, design, construction, sales and marketing, and ensuring that Trump’s world-renowned physical and operational standards are met.
“She is involved in all decisions — large and small.”
The Art of the Write-Off
Hair stylists, table linens, property taxes on a family estate — all have been deducted as business expenses.
Private jets, country clubs and mansions have all had a role in the selling of Donald Trump.
“I play to people’s fantasies,” he wrote in “Trump: The Art of the Deal.” “People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration — and a very effective form of promotion.”
If the singular Trump product is Trump in an exaggerated form — the man, the lifestyle, the acquisitiveness — then everything that feeds the image, including the cost of his businesses, can be written off on his taxes. Mr. Trump may be reporting business losses to the government, but he can still live a life of wealth and write it off.
Take, for example, Mar-a-Lago, now the president’s permanent residence as well as a private club and stage set on which Trump luxury plays out. As a business, it is also the source of millions of dollars in expenses deducted from taxable income, among them $109,433 for linens and silver and $197,829 for landscaping in 2017. Also deducted as a business expense was the $210,000 paid to a Florida photographer over the years for shooting numerous events at the club, including a 2016 New Year’s Eve party hosted by Mr. Trump.
Mar-a-Lago, where a flood of new members starting in 2015 allowed Mr. Trump to pocket an additional $5 million a year from the business, is also a source of millions in tax deductions. Saul Martinez for The New York Times
Mr. Trump has written off as business expenses costs — including fuel and meals — associated with his aircraft, used to shuttle him among his various homes and properties. Likewise the cost of haircuts, including the more than $70,000 paid to style his hair during “The Apprentice.” Together, nine Trump entities have written off at least $95,464 paid to a favorite hair and makeup artist of Ivanka Trump.
In allowing business expenses to be deducted, the I.R.S. requires that they be “ordinary and necessary,” a loosely defined standard often interpreted generously by business owners.
Perhaps Mr. Trump’s most generous interpretation of the business expense write-off is his treatment of the Seven Springs estate in Westchester County, N.Y.
Seven Springs is a throwback to another era. The main house, built in 1919 by Eugene I. Meyer Jr., the onetime head of the Federal Reserve who bought The Washington Post in 1933, sits on more than 200 acres of lush, almost untouched land just an hour’s drive north of New York City.
“The mansion is 50,000 square feet, has three pools, carriage houses, and is surrounded by nature preserves,” according to The Trump Organization website.
Mr. Trump had big plans when he bought the property in 1996 — a golf course, a clubhouse and 15 private homes. But residents of surrounding towns thwarted his ambitions, arguing that development would draw too much traffic and risk polluting the drinking water.
Mr. Trump instead found a way to reap tax benefits from the estate. He took advantage of what is known as a conservation easement. In 2015, he signed a deal with a land conservancy, agreeing not to develop most of the property. In exchange, he claimed a $21.1 million charitable tax deduction.
Mr. Trump classified the Seven Springs estate as an investment property, not a personal residence, allowing for certain tax savings. Meanwhile, Eric Trump has called it a “home base,” and the Trump Organization website describes it as a “retreat for the Trump family.” Tony Cenicola/The New York Times
The tax records reveal another way Seven Springs has generated substantial tax savings. In 2014, Mr. Trump classified the estate as an investment property, as distinct from a personal residence. Since then, he has written off $2.2 million in property taxes as a business expense — even as his 2017 tax law allowed individuals to write off only $10,000 in property taxes a year.
Courts have held that to treat residences as businesses for tax purposes, owners must show that they have “an actual and honest objective of making a profit,” typically by making substantial efforts to rent the property and eventually generating income.
Whether or not Seven Springs fits those criteria, the Trumps have described the property somewhat differently.
In 2014, Eric Trump told Forbes that “this is really our compound.” Growing up, he and his brother Donald Jr. spent many summers there, riding all-terrain vehicles and fishing on a nearby lake. At one point, the brothers took up residence in a carriage house on the property. “It was home base for us for a long, long time,” Eric told Forbes.
And the Trump Organization website still describes Seven Springs as a “retreat for the Trump family.”
Mr. Garten, the Trump Organization lawyer, did not respond to a question about the Seven Springs write-off.
The Seven Springs conservation-easement deduction is one of four that Mr. Trump has claimed over the years. While his use of these deductions is widely known, his tax records show that they represent the lion’s share of his charitable giving — about $119.3 million of roughly $130 million in personal and corporate charitable contributions reported to the I.R.S.

Two of those deductions — at Seven Springs and at the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles — are the focus of an investigation by the New York attorney general, who is examining whether the appraisals on the land, and therefore the tax deductions, were inflated.
Another common deductible expense for all businesses is legal fees. The I.R.S. requires that these fees be “directly related to operating your business,” and businesses cannot deduct “legal fees paid to defend charges that arise from participation in a political campaign.”
Yet the tax records show that the Trump Corporation wrote off as business expenses fees paid to a criminal defense lawyer, Alan S. Futerfas, who was hired to represent Donald Trump Jr. during the Russia inquiry. Investigators were examining Donald Jr.’s role in the 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians who had promised damaging information on Mrs. Clinton. When he testified before Congress in 2017, Mr. Futerfas was by his side.
Mr. Futerfas was also hired to defend the president’s embattled charitable foundation, which would be shut down in 2018 after New York regulators said it had engaged in “a shocking pattern of illegality.”
The Trump Corporation paid Mr. Futerfas at least $1.9 million in 2017 and 2018, tax records show. Also written off was at least $259,684 paid to Williams & Jensen, another law firm brought in during the same period to represent Donald Trump Jr.
A President and a Businessman
Deals in countries led by strongmen, tenants who have business before the federal government, and hotels and clubs that draw those seeking access or favor.
In May, the chairman of a trade group representing Turkish business interests wrote to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross urging support for increased trade between the United States and Turkey. The ultimate goal was nothing less than “reorienting the U.S. supply chain away from China.”
The letter was among three sent to cabinet secretaries by Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council, who noted that he had copied each one to Mr. Trump.
The president needed no introduction to Mr. Yalcindag: The Turkish businessman helped negotiate a licensing deal in 2008 for his family’s company to develop two Trump towers in Istanbul. The tax records show the deal has earned Mr. Trump at least $13 million — far more than previously known — including more than $1 million since he entered the White House, even as his onetime associate now lobbies on behalf of Turkish interests.
Mr. Yalcindag said he had “remained friendly” with Mr. Trump since their work together years ago, but that all communications between his trade group and the administration “go through formal channels and are properly disclosed.”

The ethical quandaries created by Mr. Trump’s decision to keep his business while in the White House have been documented. But the full financial measure of his extraordinary confluence of interests — a president with a wealth of business entanglements at home and in myriad geopolitical hot spots — has remained elusive.
The tax records for Mr. Trump and his hundreds of companies show precisely how much money he has received over the years, and how heavily he has come to rely on leveraging his brand in ways that pose potential or direct conflicts of interest while he is president. The records also provide the first reliable window onto his finances before 2014, the earliest year covered by his required annual disclosures, showing that his total profits from some projects outside the United States were larger than indicated by those limited public filings.
Based on the financial disclosures, which report much of his income in broad ranges, Mr. Trump’s earnings from the Istanbul towers could have been as low as $3.2 million. In the Philippines, where he licensed his name to a Manila tower nearly a decade ago, the low end of the range was $4.1 million — less than half of the $9.3 million he actually made. In Azerbaijan, he collected more than $5 million for the failed hotel project, about twice what appeared on his public filings.
It did not take long for conflicts to emerge when Mr. Trump ran for president and won. The Philippines’ strongman leader, Rodrigo Duterte, chose as a special trade envoy to Washington the businessman behind the Trump tower in Manila. In Argentina, a key person who had been involved in a Uruguayan licensing deal that earned Mr. Trump $2.3 million was appointed to a cabinet post.
The president’s conflicts have been most evident with Turkey, where the business community and the authoritarian government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have not hesitated to leverage various Trump enterprises to their advantage. When Turkish-American relations were at a low point, a Turkish business group canceled a conference at Mr. Trump’s Washington hotel; six months later, when the two countries were on better terms, the rescheduled event was attended by Turkish government officials. Turkish Airlines also chose the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia to host an event.
More broadly, the tax records suggest other ways in which Mr. Trump’s presidency has propped up his sagging bottom line. Monthly credit card receipts, reported to the I.R.S. by third-party card processing firms, reflect the way certain of his resorts, golf courses and hotels became favored stomping grounds, if not venues for influence-trading, beginning in 2015 and continuing into his time in the White House.
The credit card data does not reflect total revenue, and is useful mainly for showing short-term ups and downs of consumer interest in a business. While two of Mr. Trump’s marquee draws — the Washington hotel in the Old Post Office and the Doral golf resort — are loaded with debt and continue to lose money, both have seen credit card transactions rise markedly with his political ascent.

At the hotel, the monthly receipts grew from $3.7 million in December 2016 shortly after it opened, to $5.4 million in January 2017 and $6 million by May 2018. At Doral, after Mr. Trump declared his candidacy in June 2015, credit card revenue more than doubled, to $13 million, for the three months through August, compared with the same period the year before.
One Trump enterprise that has been regularly profitable, and is a persistent source of concern about ethical conflicts and national security lapses, is the Mar-a-Lago club. Profits there rose sharply after Mr. Trump declared his candidacy, as courtiers eagerly joining up brought a tenfold rise in cash from initiation fees — from $664,000 in 2014 to just under $6 million in 2016, even before Mr. Trump doubled the cost of initiation in January 2017. The membership rush allowed the president to take $26 million out of the business from 2015 through 2018, nearly triple the rate at which he had paid himself in the prior two years.
Some of the largest payments from business groups for events or conferences at Mar-a-Lago and other Trump properties have come since Mr. Trump became president, the tax records show.
At Doral, Mr. Trump collected a total of at least $7 million in 2015 and 2016 from Bank of America, and at least $1.2 million in 2017 and 2018 from a trade association representing food retailers and wholesalers. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce paid Doral at least $406,599 in 2018.
Beyond one-time payments for events or memberships, large corporations also pay rent for space in the few commercial buildings Mr. Trump actually owns. Walgreens, the pharmacy giant that resolved an antitrust matter before federal regulators in 2017, pays $3.4 million a year for a lease at 40 Wall Street, a Trump-owned office building in Manhattan.
Another renter at 40 Wall, for $2.5 million a year, is Atane Engineers, which changed its name in 2018 after a corruption scandal that culminated in two former top executives’ pleading guilty to paying bribes for city infrastructure contracts. Despite the criminal case — which landed the company on New York State’s list of “non-responsible entities” that require a waiver to obtain state contracts — the newly christened Atane registered as an eligible federal contractor with no restrictions listed in its file.
Rental income over all at 40 Wall has risen markedly, from $30.5 million in 2014 to $43.2 million in 2018. The tax records show that the cost of existing leases there has risen, and at least four law firms appear to have moved in since Mr. Trump ran for president.
Mr. Trump has a 30 percent stake in two valuable office towers, including one in Midtown Manhattan, shared with and managed by Vornado Realty Trust.

Jim Wilson/The New York Times
In addition to buildings he owns outright, there is the president’s stake in the Vornado partnerships that control two valuable office towers — 1290 Sixth Avenue in Manhattan and 555 California Street in San Francisco. Vornado’s chief executive, Steven Roth, is a close Trump ally recently named to the White House economic recovery council. Last year, the president appointed Mr. Roth’s wife, Daryl Roth, to the Kennedy Center board of trustees.
Vornado tenants include a roster of blue-chip firms paying multimillion-dollar leases, many of whom regularly do business with, lobby or are regulated by the federal government. Among the dozens of leases paid in 2018 to Mr. Trump’s Vornado partnerships, according to his tax records, were $5.8 million from Goldman Sachs; $3.1 million from Microsoft; $32.7 million from Neuberger Berman, an investment management company; and $8.8 million from the law firm Kirkland & Ellis.
The Gathering Storm
Threats are converging: mounting business losses, the looming I.R.S. audit and personally guaranteed debts coming due.
When Mr. Trump glided down a gilded Trump Tower escalator to kick off his presidential campaign in June 2015, his finances needed a jolt.
His core businesses were reporting mounting losses — more than $100 million over the previous two years. The river of celebrity-driven income that had long buoyed them was running dry.
If Mr. Trump hoped his unlikely candidacy might, at least, revitalize his brand, his barrage of derogatory remarks about immigrants quickly cost him two of his biggest and easiest sources of cash — licensing deals with clothing and mattress manufacturers that had netted him more than $30 million. NBC, his partner in Miss Universe — source of nearly $20 million in profits — announced that it would no longer broadcast the pageant; he sold it soon after.
Now his tax records make clear that he is facing a battery of threats to his business and his own financial well-being.
Over the past decade, he appears to have filled the cash-flow gaps with a series of one-shots that may not be available again.
In 2012, he took out a $100 million mortgage on the commercial space in Trump Tower. He took nearly the entire amount as a payout, his tax records show. His company has paid more than $15 million in interest on the loan, but nothing on the principal. The full $100 million comes due in 2022.
In 2013, he withdrew $95.8 million from his Vornado partnership account.
And in January 2014, he sold $98 million in stocks and bonds, his biggest single month of sales in at least the last two decades. He sold $54 million more in stocks and bonds in 2015, and $68.2 million in 2016. His financial disclosure released in July showed that he had as little as $873,000 in securities left to sell.
Mr. Trump’s businesses reported cash on hand of $34.7 million in 2018, down 40 percent from five years earlier.
What’s more, the tax records show that Mr. Trump has once again done what he says he regrets, looking back on his early 1990s meltdown: personally guaranteed hundreds of millions of dollars in loans, a decision that led his lenders to threaten to force him into personal bankruptcy.
This time around, he is personally responsible for loans and other debts totaling $421 million, with most of it coming due within four years. Should he win re-election, his lenders could be placed in the unprecedented position of weighing whether to foreclose on a sitting president.
There is, however, a tax benefit for Mr. Trump. While business owners can use losses to avoid taxes, they can do so only up to the amount invested in the business. But by taking personal responsibility for that $421 million in debt, Mr. Trump would be able to declare that amount in losses in future years.
The balances on those loans had not been paid down by the end of 2018. And the businesses carrying the bulk of the debt — the Doral golf resort ($125 million) and the Washington hotel ($160 million) — are struggling, which could make it difficult to find a lender willing to refinance it.
The unresolved audit of his $72.9 million tax refund hangs over his head.
The broader economy promises little relief. Across the country, brick-and-mortar stores are in decline, and they have been very important to Trump Tower, which has in turn been very important to Mr. Trump. Nike, which rented the space for its flagship store in a building attached to Trump Tower and had paid $195.1 million in rent since the 1990s, left in 2018.
The president’s most recent financial disclosure reported modest gains in 2019. But that was before the pandemic hit. His already struggling properties were shut down for several months earlier this year. The Doral resort asked Deutsche Bank to allow a delay on its loan payments. Analysts have predicted that the hotel business will not fully recover until late 2023.
Mr. Trump still has assets to sell. But doing so could take its own toll, both financial and to Mr. Trump’s desire to always be seen as a winner. The Trump family said last year that it was considering selling the Washington hotel, but not because it was losing money.
In Mr. Trump’s telling, any difficulty in his finances has been caused by the sacrifices made for his current job.
“They say, ‘Trump is getting rich off our nation,’” he said at a rally in Minneapolis last October. “I lose billions being president, and I don’t care. It’s nice to be rich, I guess, but I lose billions.”

","This week, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) helped push a tax bill through the Senate that will cost about $1 trillion. At the same time, he lamented the difficulties of finding the money to fund the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which pays for health care for 9 million children and costs about $14 billion a year — a program Hatch helped create.
A Sunday-morning tweet from MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough quoting Hatch kicked off a dustup on Twitter over the Utah Republican’s take on CHIP. Funding for the program — which was created as a joint effort between Hatch and Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy in 1997 — expired at the end of September; Congress has yet to reauthorize it. That puts health care for millions of American children at risk.
On Thursday evening, as the Senate debated the Republican tax plan, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) asked whether there’s “something we can do to get the children’s health insurance program done.”
Hatch’s response, in a nutshell: Yes, we’ll fund the program, but we’re really short on money.
“We’re going to do CHIP; there’s no question about it in my mind. And it’s got to be done the right way,” Hatch said. “But the reason CHIP’s having trouble is because we don’t have money anymore, and to just add more and more spending and more and more spending, and you can look at the rest of the bill for the more and more spending.”
This came as he advocated for a tax bill that, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation’s latest estimate, will add approximately $1 trillion to the deficit even when adjusted for economic growth, and which disproportionately benefits corporations and the wealthy.
The video of the exchange was first flagged by the Daily Kos.
In his speech, Hatch also said he thinks CHIP has done a “terrific job for people who really need the help” and noted that he had advocated for helping those who can’t help themselves throughout his Senate career. But, he continued, “I have a rough time wanting to spend billions and billions and trillions of dollars to help people who won’t help themselves, won’t lift a finger and expect the federal government to do everything.” He blamed a “liberal philosophy” for creating millions of people “who believe everything they are or ever hope to be depend upon the federal government rather than the opportunities that this great country grants them.”
It’s been two months since CHIP funding expired, and Congress still hasn’t acted
Signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1997, the Children’s Health Insurance Program provides coverage to children in low- to moderate-income families and to pregnant women. The percentage of uninsured children in America dropped from 14 percent when the program started to 4.5 percent in 2015.
Congress last reauthorized the program in 2015 and was due to do so again by September 30, 2017. Except this time around, congressional leaders let that deadline pass. And while states contribute some money to the program, it is primarily funded by the federal government, which means its money will soon start to run out.
According to the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute Center for Children and Families, at least six states — Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Minnesota, Ohio, and Oregon — are predicting they will run out of money by early January if CHIP isn’t reauthorized. And six other states — Colorado, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Washington — have said they’ll take action and notify families their coverage is about to be cut off before the end of the year even if funding isn’t running out yet.
There are some backstops in place. States can keep covering children through Medicaid programs or send children to the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces to buy coverage. But those aren’t options everywhere, and it’s likely some children will fall through the cracks regardless of whether Congress reauthorizes CHIP, given the current uncertainty in funding the program.
“Every time one of those kinds of things happens, we have to retool our relationships with families,” Steve Freedman, a University of South Florida health policy professor who sits on the CHIP board there, recently told Vox’s Dylan Scott. “When you start fiddling with people’s economic security, particularly their children’s health care, that’s a really sensitive place to screw around.”
On Thursday, Hatch seemed to acknowledge the potentially disastrous consequences of the CHIP standoff. But what he failed to recognize is that, at least in some cases, the damage might already be done."

","Changes to tax withholding practices have left many Americans who expected a refund instead owing money to the IRS.
Many Americans who filed their tax returns early in this year’s tax season discovered rather than receiving their usual refunds, they actually owe money to the IRS — and some who voted for President Donald Trump are now regretting their decision.
According to Vox, the issue is two-fold: the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changed the method of withholding, leading to more employers underwithholding rather than overwithholding; and the law also “eliminated or curbed a whole bunch of popular tax deductions.”
Savvy taxpayers who closely followed the news last year might have heard about the potential effect these changes would have on their tax returns, but as Vox noted:
This was all explained in a Government Accountability Office report last summer, but it turns out that many people are not regular readers of GAO reports and did not take the GAO’s official advice to check their withholding status. The result? Surprise tax bills!
How does withholding work?
In practice, however, the government has employers calculate how much tax their workers are likely to owe at the end of the year. Then each pay period, companies simply forward an appropriate amount of money directly to the IRS and pay you what’s left over. When you file your taxes at the beginning of the year, you compare the amount of taxes you owe to the amount of taxes you’ve already paid and get either a refund or a request to send more money. And historically, by design, most people — around 75 percent — get a refund. That’s because it’s a lot easier for the government to pay out refunds to people who overwithheld than to run around trying to collect cash from people who underwithheld.
And how did the new tax law change withholding?
The change is that fewer taxpayers should be overwithholding and more should be under withholding — in other words, fewer people will get a refund and more people will be asked to pay up. Treasury’s viewpoint is that this is change for the better. Under the old system, 75 percent of taxpayers were getting refunds — meaning that the withholding system was poorly targeted on average. By switching to a new system in which fewer people get refunds and more people owe extra money, they will be achieving a more balanced result.

","Fifty years ago this summer, the collapse of this country seemed not only plausible, but imminent. Martin Luther King Jr. had been killed, touching off a series of riots across the country that led to dozens of deaths, thousands of arrests, and the razing of large swaths of major cities. Two months later, Robert Kennedy was murdered in the middle of a presidential campaign. By the time clashes broke out between police and demonstrators outside the Democratic National Convention that August, a sense that the nation was spiraling toward anarchy had set in. Anarchy never really came, but the year’s confrontations offered a preview of the public violence that would continue through the end of the decade and into the beginning of the 1970s.

This past week has been relatively pleasant by comparison, but you wouldn’t know it reading the commentary on White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ thwarted meal at the Red Hen in Lexington, Virginia. She was asked to leave by co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson, who explained to the Washington Post that Sanders’ presence made members of the staff uncomfortable and that her work conflicted with the restaurant’s values. This was the third time in recent days that a member of the Trump administration had been confronted at a restaurant. Last week, White House adviser Stephen Miller was heckled at a Mexican restaurant in Washington. Two nights later, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen left another Mexican restaurant in town after being confronted by activists protesting the administration’s family separations.

This has triggered a remarkable upwelling of bipartisan angst. “If you want to live in the kind of society where you’re harassed by those who oppose your worldview every time you go out in public - or stay home, for that matter,” conservative commentator Ben Shapiro tweeted, “by all means let’s continue down this ridiculous, stupid path.” “I guess we’re heading into an America with Democrat-only restaurants, which will lead to Republican-only restaurants,” Bush White House press secretary Ari Fleischer tweeted. “Do the fools who threw Sarah out, and the people who cheer them on, really want us to be that kind of country?” Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said the country is now “divided by red plates & blue plates!” Arne Duncan, the former Obama education secretary, compared the move to racial segregation. “The history in our country of denying people access to restaurants, to water fountains and even bathrooms is too raw, too real,” he wrote.

The very same conservatives who inspired and encouraged extreme rhetoric are now admonishing liberals and the left for incivility.
On Sunday, the Washington Post’s editorial board wrote that while the paper stands against the Trump administration’s border policy and racist rhetoric, they “nonetheless would argue that Ms. Huckabee, and Ms. Nielsen and Mr. Miller, too, should be allowed to eat dinner in peace. Those who are insisting that we are in a special moment justifying incivility should think for a moment how many Americans might find their own special moment.”
The underlying premise of these reactions—that the restaurant protests herald a new and troubling level of political reaction—deserves some prodding. America’s political history has been incredibly raucous and tumultuous from the beginning, and one hardly has to reach back to the events of 1968 or 1868 to illustrate this. You need only to turn to the late campaign rallies for a man now widely heralded by pundits as a paragon of civility and statesmanship in contemporary American politics. There was a period in the fall of 2008 when it seemed like every broadcast from the campaign trail carried news of a new outburst from the audiences for John McCain and Sarah Palin. “Terrorist.” “Traitor.” “Off with his head.” “Kill him.” These were cries spurred in no small part by the McCain campaign’s lies and innuendo about Barack Obama’s affiliations with radicals. We were treated, after Obama’s election, to images of the president being hanged or burned in effigy. One of the more inventive and memorable anti-Obama displays was a rodeo show featuring a clown “Obama” chased by a bull. “We’re going to stomp Obama now,” the announcer would say. The racist images of Barack and Michelle Obama as monkeys—of Obama as a tribesman in a loincloth with a bone through his nose—seemed, after a while, to blur into each other. There was a fad, early on, of bringing loaded guns to Obama’s speeches. That died down, but the fantasies of armed revolution, talk of 1776, and “watering the tree of liberty” did not.

The very same conservatives who inspired and encouraged that rhetoric are now admonishing liberals and the left for incivility. The Resurgent’s Erick Erickson tweeted Saturday that Sanders’ treatment is evidence of a new political pathology. “It is actually a sign of sickness in our country that political opposites cheer/jeer a business refusing service due to political beliefs,” he wrote. This from a man who responded to the passage of a ban on phosphates in dish soap in Spokane County, Washington, in 2009 by invoking the possibility of armed insurrection. “At what point do the people tell the politicians to go to hell?” he asked in a post at RedState. “At what point do they get off the couch, march down to their state legislator’s house, pull him outside, and beat him to a bloody pulp for being an idiot? … Were I in Washington State, I’d be cleaning my gun right about now waiting to protect my property from the coming riots or the government apparatchiks coming to enforce nonsensical legislation.”

This kind of extremism has been deployed on the behalf of conservative social politics for decades. The Washington Post’s editorial on the restaurant protests speculates that anti-abortion activists inspired by the left might decide “judges or other officials who protect abortion rights should not be able to live peaceably with their families,” an odd statement that erases the pro-life movement’s already very long history of antagonism and open violence, including the assassination of doctor George Tiller in 2009, a shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in 2015 that killed three, and seven other murders by pro-life extremists that have occurred since 1977. Vandalism and threats against abortion providers and advocates over the same period number in the thousands.

Many of the civil rights movement’s now-romanticized sit-ins were attempts to interrupt meals served by and to people the movement’s activists disagreed with.
It is routinely said that political incivility is counterproductive—that rudeness and caustic or intemperate rhetoric can alienate potential allies and provoke a backlash from political opponents. If this were always or reliably true, the American right would have been decimated long ago. Instead, they’ve just elected a man who has encouraged political violence—a casual racist and misogynist and an unrepentant boor—to the presidency of the United States. The Republican Party holds the House, the Senate, and total control of government in 26 states. The right’s turn toward incivility has, plainly, been a spectacular success for fairly obvious reasons: Rude and extreme rhetoric has galvanized and mobilized the Republican base by catastrophizing the consequences of Democratic governance and demographic change. This has won the right the support of less–ideologically committed and active voters who have found the rhetoric of Trump and precursors like Sarah Palin relatable, refreshing, and “honest.”
Politics is a complicated business. Sometimes nice guys win. Sometimes they lose. And sometimes they do things that aren’t very nice. In tweets criticizing liberals over the protests and shaming of Trump officials, the Atlantic’s Conor Friedersdorf invoked Martin Luther King as a moral example worth following on the “ ‘civility works better’ side,” as critics of contemporary liberal and left activism and identity politics often do. In fact, King spoke out against those who characterized forms of nonviolent activism as uncivil. “I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate,” he wrote in his “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” “who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ‘I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action.’ ” And, of course, many of the civil rights movement’s now-romanticized and revered sit-ins were literally attempts to interrupt meals served by and to people the movement’s activists disagreed with. It is hard to imagine the pundit class reacting positively to hundreds or even a thousand liberal activists crowding into, say, a bakery that refuses to sell wedding cakes to gay people, in an attempt to shut it down or force compliance with their political beliefs. That is precisely what civil rights activists did.

Civility scolds who invoke King generally elide moreover the extent to which the fear of black rioting and violence was an impetus for the passage of civil rights legislation as well as the extent to which unrest can activate people as political actors. The latter dynamic was the crux of a paper assessing the impact of the 1992 Los Angeles riots published last year by Harvard’s Ryan Enos, Aaron Russell Kaufman, and Melissa L. Sands. After evaluating voter turnout and participation numbers and support for ballot initiatives aimed at addressing racial inequities in public education, they concluded that the riots were politically productive in achieving some of the goals desired by the rioters. “Our results indicate that a riot can help to accomplish policy or symbolic goals by mobilizing supporters or building sympathy among others,” they wrote. “We showed that white and African American voters were mobilized to register as Democrats and shifted their policy support toward public schools, net of a general shift in support for education. This mobilization appears to have persisted: those mobilized by the riot remained regular participators over a decade later and remained more Democratic than the general population, even after accounting for demographics.”

None of this is to say that incivility, protest, and unrest don’t incur real and potentially significant political and social costs, or that all political goals justify the tactics used to end, say, segregation. But these debates—usually undertaken in the wake of something the left has done or said about Trump, or some pseudo-crisis on campus—often lead to silly places, like the idea that liberals confronting Trump officials at, or barring them from, restaurants will inevitably lead to a crisis of tolerance nationwide, if not the collapse of the republic. The potential consequences of political incivility should be addressed soberly, with the worthiness of the cause the uncivil seek to advance always in mind.
In this case, the Trump administration has demonstrated that it is willing to turn its racist rhetoric into indisputably inhumane policy, and capable of doing so. The president and his associates are almost comically corrupt. In their lies about election fraud, calls to investigate their political opponents, and attacks on the legitimacy of the free press, they are hacking away at the principles underpinning American democracy. These are unambiguously valid objections to this administration held by people on both sides of the aisle that stand even if one does not believe, as liberals and those on the left do, that the Trump administration’s policies on, say, health care, taxation, and the environment are unconscionable.
If the invitations into polite society that have been extended to the likes of Corey Lewandowski and Steve Bannon are any indication, few people will face real sanctions for their involvement in this administration and with this president. Beyond elections, which do not actually offer the residents of D.C. the opportunity to take a stand against Trump, nonviolent protest, which clearly includes heckling and refusals of service, will be an outlet for liberals angry about what is happening and will happen under Trump for a long time. It is possible that the right will attempt to mimic them. That is fine. Nonviolent protest tactics should be open to everyone in a democracy who wishes to have their voices heard, and will assuredly be utilized to great effect in the century ahead, which promises to be incredibly contentious and uncivil no matter how politely liberals comport themselves."

","If you’re a US president, it’s probably not a great idea to meet with a foreign leader who meddled in your country’s elections without some way to record what’s being discussed.
But that’s just what President Donald Trump apparently did — again.
According to the Financial Times, Trump spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin during last November’s G20 summit in Argentina without a US official present to take notes. First lady Melania Trump was by the president’s side during the chat, but no staff joined them.
The White House had previously acknowledged that both leaders met for an “informal” talk but didn’t disclose that Trump had no official member of his team present. Putin did have someone, though: his translator, although it’s unclear if that person wrote anything down.
This isn’t the first time Trump has done this. During the G20 meeting in Germany in July 2017, he got up from his seat during a dinner in order to sit next to Putin, who did have his translator to help. That meeting, which the White House didn’t initially reveal, came just hours after Trump bought Putin’s denial that Russia didn’t intervene in the 2016 presidential election.
Why having no note taker matters
There are two major problems with Trump’s continued and ill-advised conduct.
First, the optics. Trump continually finds ways to meet with Putin privately. That’s a really bad look when you consider the fact that US intelligence says the Russian directed a sophisticated campaign to help Trump win the White House, not to mention special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into possible Trump-Russia ties during the 2016 presidential campaign.
But second, and more importantly, we’ll never really know what happened during the Trump-Putin chat since only four people were there — Trump, Putin, the first lady, and the translator — and nothing was recorded (that we know of).
In addition to this, the administration apparently has no notes of any of the many Trump-Putin interactions over a two-year span. And at least on one occasion in 2017, Trump told his translator after an official meeting with Putin not to share details of the meeting with staff. Trump actually seized his notes.
This isn’t a minor clerical issue. It actively hinders some US officials from doing their job when they don’t receive a detailed briefing about what the president discussed with another head of state. Without knowing what they agreed to, fought about, or even laughed at, it’s nearly impossible for the administration to conduct policy accordingly.
And let’s not forget that we’re talking about Trump here: the guy who shared highly classified intelligence in a meeting with top Russian officials in the Oval Office back in May 2017 and who has surrounded himself with a high number of pro-Kremlin confidants.
The president may not care how his meetings with Putin are received, especially since he has said he wants to improve the US-Russia relationship. He may believe a personal rapport with Putin can make that happen.
Even if that’s true, though, he’s going about it in the worst possible way."

","Barack Obama also said violating the Iran nuclear deal could undermine the United States’ credibility on the international stage. | Milos Bicanski/Getty Images Obama: Withdrawing from Iran nuclear deal ‘is a serious mistake’
Former President Barack Obama offered a rare public rebuttal to President Donald Trump on Tuesday, calling his decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear “a serious mistake.”
Obama has been reluctant to rebuke his White House successor, following a precedent set by previous chief executives. But the potential unraveling of his signature foreign policy achievement prompted a 12-paragraph statement on Tuesday.
“We all know the dangers of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon,” wrote Obama, who spent 18 months negotiating the agreement in 2014 and 2015 . “If the constraints on Iran’s nuclear program under the JCPOA are lost, we could be hastening the day when we are faced with the choice between living with that threat, or going to war to prevent it.”
Trump has long been outspoken in his criticism of Obama and the deal, which he blasted as “decaying” in his announcement on Tuesday. The U.S. is planning to reimpose a set of sanctions within months, though Iran said it would seek to preserve the deal during a limited period of talks with its other signatories, China, France, Russia, Germany, Britain and the European Union.
But Obama emphasized that the deal “was never intended to solve all of our problems with Iran,” and he warned that undermining it despite no clear evidence of Iranian violations could hasten an arms race or outright regional conflict.

“The reality is clear,” he wrote. “The JCPOA is working — that is a view shared by our European allies, independent experts, and the current U.S. Secretary of Defense.”
Obama also said violating the deal could undermine the United States’ credibility on the international stage. He said the JCPOA had worked to halt Iran’s progress toward a nuclear weapon, highlighting its international inspections and noting that some of its provisions were permanent.
Obama has made few public comments about Trump's presidency, although he made an exception last year when Trump moved to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, another of Obama's signature acts.
Former Vice President Joe Biden echoed Obama’s concerns Tuesday, accusing Trump of acting out of reckless self-interest.
“President Trump has manufactured a crisis for his own political interests that puts us on a collision course not only with an adversary but also with our closest partners,” Biden said in a statement.
He added that withdrawal could backfire by rallying other countries to Iran’s side. “It will allow Iran to garner international sympathy while doing nothing to reduce its harmful activities across the Middle East,” he said.
U.S. allies and adversaries that were party to the agreement had urged the Trump administration not to tear it up. But Trump deemed the JCPOA a bad deal that failed to make the U.S. safer, and said he was following through on his promises.
Secretary of State John Kerry, who spent countless hours negotiating the agreement with his Iranian counterpart as well as officials from Europe, China and Russia, also blasted the move.
“Today's announcement weakens our security, breaks America's word, isolates us from our European allies, puts Israel at greater risk, empowers Iran's hardliners, and reduces our global leverage to address Tehran's misbehavior, while damaging the ability of future Administrations to make international agreements,"" Kerry said.
""The extent of the damage will depend on what Europe can do to hold the nuclear agreement together, and it will depend on Iran’s reaction. ... We should all hope the world can preserve the nuclear agreement,"" he added."

","At the first presidential debate of the 2020 general election, the President of the United States refused to condemn white supremacists and told a far-right paramilitary street gang that openly supports him that they should ""stand by."" This is not hyperbole. This is not some dramatic interpretation. It is simply what he said. He was asked to condemn white supremacy and he would not. He seemed almost confused at the suggestion. Instead, he directly addressed the Proud Boys, who have violently attacked their political opponents in the street before, and said that they should ""stand back and stand by.""

What on earth would they be standing by for? Could it be for when, as he once again signaled he would do here, he declares the election was rigged? He again refused to say that he would respect the results of a democratic election. Because he won't. He's already said, as he did in 2016, that he will accept the results if he wins. And what happens if he doesn't, and he says it was stolen from him? What will his most extreme supporters, who believe he is all that stands between them and the abyss, do then?
Even if you grant that ""stand by"" might have been a blurt-of-the-moment thing, why is the president incapable of condemning white supremacy? After the terror in Charlottesville, in which a white supremacist murdered an anti-racist protester with his car, he said that ""very fine people"" march alongside Ku Klux Klan members and neo-Nazis. Now there are incidents of cars running into protesters all the time. A man who is self-identifying as a part of a ""militia"" shot two protesters dead in the street in Kenosha, Wisconsin in August. Oh, and the Proud Boys are reportedly already celebrating this line—""Stand Back, Stand By""—as a sort of slogan. Seems like they got the message.
We are living on a knife's edge already, and the president is declaring the election will be rigged—""this is going to be a fraud like you’ve never seen""—and telling his supporters they should go ""monitor"" polling places on Election Day. He specifically mentioned Philadelphia, a predominantly Democratic city in a key swing state, where he said ""bad things happen.""

None of this is true. There is no evidence ""tens of thousands of ballots will be manipulated."" He is just making it up. But the consequences will be very real.
Meanwhile, poll watchers are a feature of elections in every state, but you're supposed to formally register for the gig. Also, Republicans have been banned from deploying poll watchers since the 1980s after they entered a consent decree following allegations they'd engaged in voter intimidation in a New Jersey gubernatorial election. Of course, a federal judge threw out that consent decree just in time for this election, and the Republican Party is sinking tens of millions of dollars into the effort. But it's not even clear Trump is referring to this formal program. He may simply aim to foment chaos for people voting in person on Election Day, having already tried to discourage people from voting by mail.
The president has repeatedly refused to condemn white supremacists. That’s it. OLIVIER DOULIERY Getty Images
We seem to have memory-holed it, but a devout fan of the president sent mail bombs to the houses of Democrats and major media figures who were regularly featured on the president's list of enemies. Another man drove hours to an El Paso Walmart and shot the place up, publishing a manifesto that made clear he was targeting Hispanic people he found there, and which often echoed the president's rhetoric on immigration. Another man shot up a Pittsburgh synagogue based on a conspiracy theory related to The Caravan the president obsessed over leading up to the 2018 midterm elections.
The president's performance on the night of Tuesday, September 29, 2020, was of a piece with everything that he has presented to the world in his time in public life. He trafficked in wild conspiracy theories, he attacked his opponent's family, he interrupted constantly to spout nonsense. Joe Biden was meandering at times, and he did not set the world on fire. But he has pledged to accept the results of the goddamned election, and while he isn't as sharp as he once was, he appears to have a basic capacity for human empathy and impulse control. Oh, and he denounces white supremacists. The president will not. He cannot stop himself from welcoming them because they support him. And why do the white supremacists support the president? Why do the Klansmen and the neo-Nazis who showed up in Charlottesville all feel so jazzed about the current occupant of the White House? And if they're so happy, should anyone else be?

","Trump’s understanding of concepts such as patriotism, service, and sacrifice has interested me since he expressed contempt for the war record of the late Senator John McCain, who spent more than five years as a prisoner of the North Vietnamese. “He’s not a war hero,” Trump said in 2015 while running for the Republican nomination for president. “I like people who weren’t captured.”
Read: John McCain’s death brought out the worst in the Trump administration
There was no precedent in American politics for the expression of this sort of contempt, but the performatively patriotic Trump did no damage to his candidacy by attacking McCain in this manner. Nor did he set his campaign back by attacking the parents of Humayun Khan, an Army captain who was killed in Iraq in 2004.
Trump remained fixated on McCain, one of the few prominent Republicans to continue criticizing him after he won the nomination. When McCain died, in August 2018, Trump told his senior staff, according to three sources with direct knowledge of this event, “We’re not going to support that loser’s funeral,” and he became furious, according to witnesses, when he saw flags lowered to half-staff. “What the fuck are we doing that for? Guy was a fucking loser,” the president told aides. Trump was not invited to McCain’s funeral. (These sources, and others quoted in this article, spoke on condition of anonymity. The White House did not return earlier calls for comment, but Alyssa Farah, a White House spokesperson, emailed me this statement shortly after this story was posted: “This report is false. President Trump holds the military in the highest regard. He’s demonstrated his commitment to them at every turn: delivering on his promise to give our troops a much needed pay raise, increasing military spending, signing critical veterans reforms, and supporting military spouses. This has no basis in fact.”)
Eliot A. Cohen: America’s generals must stand up to Trump
Trump’s understanding of heroism has not evolved since he became president. According to sources with knowledge of the president’s views, he seems to genuinely not understand why Americans treat former prisoners of war with respect. Nor does he understand why pilots who are shot down in combat are honored by the military. On at least two occasions since becoming president, according to three sources with direct knowledge of his views, Trump referred to former President George H. W. Bush as a “loser” for being shot down by the Japanese as a Navy pilot in World War II. (Bush escaped capture, but eight other men shot down during the same mission were caught, tortured, and executed by Japanese soldiers.)
When lashing out at critics, Trump often reaches for illogical and corrosive insults, and members of the Bush family have publicly opposed him. But his cynicism about service and heroism extends even to the World War I dead buried outside Paris—people who were killed more than a quarter century before he was born. Trump finds the notion of military service difficult to understand, and the idea of volunteering to serve especially incomprehensible. (The president did not serve in the military; he received a medical deferment from the draft during the Vietnam War because of the alleged presence of bone spurs in his feet. In the 1990s, Trump said his efforts to avoid contracting sexually transmitted diseases constituted his “personal Vietnam.”)"

","Judge Restores Wisconsin Governor's Powers, Strikes Down GOP Laws
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andy Manis/AP Andy Manis/AP
A judge has struck down the laws that Wisconsin Republicans passed in December's lame-duck session of the state's Legislature, restoring powers to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, if only temporarily.
A county judge ruled on Thursday that all of the laws and appointments passed by legislators were unlawful because they met in what's known as an ""extraordinary session,"" which isn't explicitly allowed under the state's constitution.
Evers seized on the decision almost immediately, calling on the Wisconsin Department of Justice, led by Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul, to withdraw the state from a lawsuit that seeks to overturn the Affordable Care Act.
""As the governor has requested, please take whatever steps are necessary to remove Wisconsin from Texas v. United States,"" wrote Evers' chief legal counsel, Ryan Nilsestuen, in an email to the Department of Justice shortly after the ruling was released.
Evers and Kaul campaigned on leaving the case, but one of the lame-duck laws has prevented them from following through on their pledge.
The ruling also temporarily struck down 82 appointments that former Republican Gov. Scott Walker made during the waning days of his administration, all of which were confirmed by Republican state senators in the lame-duck session.
If the ruling holds, those appointments would now be Evers' to make.
Evers issued a statement praising the ruling, calling it a victory for the people and one that preserves the Wisconsin Constitution.
""The Legislature overplayed its hand by using an unlawful process to accumulate more power for itself and override the will of the people, despite the outcome of last November's election,"" Evers said. ""I look forward to putting this disappointing chapter behind us so we can move forward together to put the needs of the people of Wisconsin first.""
What remains to be seen is whether a higher court will step in to block Evers from taking further action.
Republican leaders Rep. Robin Vos and state Sen. Scott Fitzgerald promised to appeal the ruling, saying in a statement that it ran contrary to the way the Legislature had done business for years.
""For decades the Legislature has used extraordinary sessions that have been widely supported by members of both parties,"" they said. ""Today's ruling only creates chaos and will surely raise questions about items passed during previous extraordinary sessions.""
The lawsuit was brought by a coalition of plaintiffs that includes the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin, Disability Rights Wisconsin and Black Leaders Organizing for Communities.
A federal judge ruled against Republicans in January, blocking laws that were passed in the lame-duck session that limited early voting."

","Washington, DC -- A federal judge in Maryland will allow Maryland and D.C. officials access to the Trump Organization’s business records, dealing another blow to President Donald Trump’s effort to stop a lawsuit claiming his -- and his family’s -- ownership of a Washington, D.C., hotel have put him at odds with the Constitution's prohibition on government officials accepting payments from foreign states without permission from Congress.
The plaintiffs in the case, the attorneys general of the District of Columbia and the state of Maryland, have alleged that their local businesses have suffered as a result of foreign governments seeking to do more business with the Trump International Hotel. The government insisted that Trump has done nothing wrong, and in particular, that there has been no quid pro quo.
Senior U.S. District Court Judge Peter Messitte on Friday denied the Justice Department’s request to put the case on hold while the administration seeks an appeal, and he ordered the plaintiffs to present a schedule for accessing hotel records and other confidential materials within 20 days.
In a memorandum supporting his decision, the judge emphasized his continued disagreement with the Trump administration's interpretation of the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, enacted out of concern officials overseas might take gifts or bribes. “Even now it remains unclear, as it did in connection with the President’s original motion to dismiss, exactly how he came to his view of the meaning of ‘emolument,’” the judge wrote.
“What he said in his Motion to Dismiss and repeats now is that the President would have to receive payments for his services as President for the payments to qualify as prohibited ‘emoluments,’ Messitte added. ""By every reasonable metric, this appears to describe what is tantamount to a bribe, so above all else the President’s definition of the term ‘emolument’ is exceedingly strained.”
The Constitution bars federal officials from taking emoluments from any “King, Prince, or Foreign State.”
“The Department of Justice disagrees with and is disappointed by this ruling,"" DOJ spokeswoman Kelly Laco said in a statement to ABC News. ""This case, which should have been dismissed, presents important questions that warrant immediate appellate review.”
The plaintiffs have also sued Trump in his personal capacity, aiming to get his tax returns, but Judge Messitte has essentially sidelined that part of the case, and it is unclear what will happen with it, according to two people involved in the lawsuit.
A second case involving claims that President Trump violated the emoluments clause is currently wending its way through a federal court in Washington, D.C. The judge in that case ruled in late September that the plaintiffs - more than 200 Democratic members of Congress - have standing."

","All 140 legislative seats are up for grabs in Virginia, and after twenty years of a maintained Republican majority, the House and Senate have both flipped from blue to red.
Democrats had a significant fundraising advantage this election, and spent more on TV advertisements, but Republicans have held a slim majority in both house and local state senate ever since 1996. That changed tonight, with 21 seats going to Democrats and 16 to Republicans in the State Senate, and 50 seats going to Democrats in the House of Delegates to the Republican camp's 39.
The race was very contentious on all sides of the political map, with families feeling pulled apart.
""I've had many folks at the door express, in tears, how they are sickened by national politics, they're sickened by the fact they cannot even talk to their own neighbors or among their own family members,"" said Ghazala Hashmi, a former college literature professor who won a seat on the State Senate this evening to The New York Times.
Among others reelected this evening was Danica Roem, the first out trans person elected to state legislature. Roem has now become the first out trans person to be reelected to their seat. Roem won 57 percent of the vote while defeating anti-LGBTQ candidate Kelly McGinn.
""In 2017, Danica wrote the playbook on how transgender candidates can defeat anti-LGBTQ opponents through authenticity and attention to everyday issues—and her reelection victory sets it in stone,"" said Annise Parker, president and CEO of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, in a press release. The Victory Fund had invested heavily in Roem's campaign.
""Voters did not head to the polls to make history, yet they proved trans candidates can win battleground races in battleground states despite transphobic attacks from opponents. Danica inspired trans people across the nation to run for office. Her reelection proves that political revolution is a lasting transformation—not an aberration,"" Parker continued.
The import of the election as a referendum on the Trump era was echoed by former Attorney General Eric Holder, who did some extensive campaigning for various candidates throughout the state.
""I can guarantee that the news media will be looking at the election results,"" he said in a stump speech to volunteers. ""And they'll be saying, well, this is an assessment of—fill in the blank—Trump, the Republicans, direction of the country, all that stuff.""
""But no pressure,"" he concluded."

","During his March 2 marathon speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), President Donald Trump referred to Senator Mazie Hirono as the ""crazy female senator,"" but rather than be offended by the remark, the junior senator from Hawaii says it's a ""badge of honor"" and has some choice words of her own for the president.
""This is the second time that he's referred to me as the 'crazy female senator from Hawaii,'"" said Hirono when asked during a Politico Playbook event about the president's apparent nickname for her. ""I've decided that the reason he doesn't say my name is because he can't figure out how to pronounce it and doesn't want to look foolish in front of his adoring audience.""
To be precise, during the CPAC speech, Trump initially referred to Hirono as the ""crazy female senator from the state of Ohio"" before quickly correcting that to ""state of Hawaii."" He immediately doubled down on the characterization, adding ""She's like -- she's like a crazed person.""
Hirono's response to the name-calling?
""I think It's pretty funny,"" said Hirono. ""If the president wants to call me names, that's a badge of honor… He calls everyone who doesn't agree with him names.""
Then the senator had some names of her own for Trump.
""He's a liar; he lies every single day,"" she claimed. ""He's a misogynist. He's an admitted sexual predator, and he attacks everyone who doesn't agree with him. And the only thing that will save us is his resignation.""
Hirono addressed the time Trump called her a ""crazy female senator.""

Later during the program, Hirono stressed that while she believes it is ""time to investigate"" Trump and his tax returns, she cautioned against the push for the new Democratic majority to immediately impeach the president. ""We should not be rushing in to impeach him... I certainly don't want to end up making the president a martyr."""

""So let me be as honest and clear as I possibly can. Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country.

","The Washington Post brings us both stories, but the news that Trump is Sad, as ""deaths mount"" and as the Trump team abandons efforts to fight the virus to instead focus on ""reopening"" the country, is surely the more important news. The administration has not been able to orchestrate the sort of widespread testing that other nations are relying on to determine when they should reopen their own economies, so the answer is to not try. There is no contact tracing plan. There is no evidence that anyone has been able to drum into Trump's empty head even the most basic facts about the virus—no, it will not ""go away on its own""—or that Mike Pence or any of the other top Trump officials give a particular damn about trying.
And so Trump is sad. The Post reports that some of Trump's advisers ""described the president as glum and shell-shocked by his declining popularity"" and that ""in private conversations, he has struggled to process how his fortunes suddenly changed from believing he was on a glide path to reelection to realizing that he is losing"" in the polls to Biden. Truly, Dear Leader is having a moment here.
Oh—and we also learn that Dr. Deborah Birx is upset with the Centers of Disease Control for counting too many deaths. We learn that the administration's distribution of their new bet-everything-on-this wonder drug, remdesivir, is as botched as the rollout of the last one, with not even the task force being given a heads-up before the government shipped out supply of the drug to seven states before anyone apparently bothered to determine which states might most need it. We learn that Jared Fucking Kushner is inexplicably taking command of more bullshit he knows nothing about, and that not even Stephen Moore's only extended family is buying his calls for a little economy-boosting grandma murdering, and that everything remains chaotic, bungling, delusion-based and thoroughly incompetent.
But there is a plan. The new White House plan is that people are going to keep dying, and likely in larger numbers than even now, and Trump is somehow going to argue that that's fine. Or a victory. Or the price America must pay, to have someone as grand and as orange as Himself in charge of it. He's going to resume rallies and Americans are going to continue to die at the rate of 2,000 a day, likely rising higher in the next few weeks.
Is the public ""willing to accept that?"" frets an anonymous White House adviser to the Post. Yes, that is the real question here. Not whether it should be prevented, but whether the White House will be politically successful in selling it.
That has become the new Senate Republican plan too. In a separate Post story, we learn that Republicans are ""increasingly nervous"" they will lose the Senate majority as a result of, you know, their party's incompetence killing what could be, in November, anywhere from 100,000 (best case) to quarter million people (our new middle case, perhaps.)
But what if the economy recovers? Then perhaps killing a six-figure number of American civilians might turn out to be politically tolerable. Also, Republican senators plan to tout their support for the massive economic relief packages that they seem to presume are relief-ing far more Americans than so far have been the case. Also also, ""efforts to target China will continue throughout the campaign.""
It will be a stress test of just how far the Republican base has itself descended into xenophobic fascism, in other words. Is it all right that Dear Leader botched, absolutely, the most pivotal national disaster the nation has seen in a century? What if we claim it is the fault of foreigners? Is the giddy thrill of having an openly racist, boorish national shitposter as leader still so intoxicating that the base will stomach even people in their own neighborhoods dying in order to keep that intoxicating version of ""winning"" flowing through their veins?
Probably, as the white-nationalism heavy protests against pandemic safety demonstrate. But Republicans fret that their dreaded enemy, also known as absolutely everyone else in America, might have even stronger feelings about Trump killing large numbers of us. Can the party's digital operations nullify all those unpleasant cretins mumbling that maybe they didn't want the Spanish Flu combined with the Great Depression, no matter how much President Hairstyle insists on his victory? Will Republican donors continue to support the party's anti-competence, pro-catastrophe stance, if the party can sweeten the pot by promising to cut their taxes a wee bit more? The pundits will all be on edge.
In the meantime, Republicans are Sad nationwide, it seems, from the White House downward. Not because even after 80,000 deaths the arch-conservative Republican administration continues to not have even one damn clue as to how to stop Americans from dying in whatever proportions the virus wishes them to, but because it is cutting into their poll numbers.
It's very tragic. How very terrible, to live under such a constant feeling of dread and slow-moving disaster. The rest of us would be hard pressed to even imagine what that might be like."

","With his impeachment trial set to begin this week, a narrow majority of Americans say they support the Senate convicting former President Donald Trump and barring him from holding federal office again, according to a new ABC News/Ipsos poll released Sunday.
Compared to public attitudes in the early days of his first impeachment trial, support for the Senate convicting Trump is higher now. In an ABC News/Washington Post poll published in late January 2020, when the first trial was ongoing but before senators had voted, 47% of Americans said the Senate should vote to remove Trump from office and 49% said he should not be removed.
But in this latest poll, 56% of Americans say Trump should be convicted and barred from holding office again, and 43% say he should not be. The new poll was conducted by Ipsos in partnership with ABC News using Ipsos' KnowledgePanel.
Meanwhile, the attention on Capitol Hill last week focused more on the fate of a new Republican member of Congress who has faced backlash for espousing extremist views and support for the QAnon conspiracy theory in her past. That focus, which followed the deadly insurrection on the U.S. Capitol that Trump is accused of inciting, seems to have taken a toll on the public's perception of the party. By a 17-point margin, Americans say there are more radical extremists within the GOP than the Democratic Party.
On Jan. 13, Trump became the first president ever to be impeached by the House of Representatives twice, when a majority of the body's members voted in favor of charging Trump with ""incitement of insurrection"" for his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
A key difference between this trial and the first is that Trump is no longer president and therefore cannot be removed from office. All but five Republican senators have gone on the record saying they think the trial is unconstitutional because of this fact. Still, Democrats have argued that failing to hold Trump accountable would signal to future presidents that they can evade punishment for their actions, as long as they come at the end of their term in office.
It would take 67 senators to vote to convict Trump, meaning 17 Republicans would need to be on board, assuming every member of the Democratic caucus votes to convict. If enough senators vote to convict, the chamber could hold a second vote on whether to bar him from holding federal office again. That would only take a simple majority.
A few Republican senators have said, or have reportedly said, that they think Trump committed an impeachable offense. Yet, none have said definitively that they will vote to convict the ex-president. But unlike the first impeachment, when no Republicans voted to impeach Trump in the House, 10 Republicans joined Democrats this time, including the chair of the House Republican Conference, Liz Cheney.
Support for conviction among Republicans was low in the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll, but slightly higher than it was ahead of Trump's first Senate impeachment trial. In the January 2020 ABC News/Washington Post poll, 9% of Republicans said the Senate should vote to remove Trump from office. In this new poll, 15% of Republicans say they support the Senate convicting and barring Trump from office.
Among Democrats, support for Trump's conviction is nearly universal in the ABC News/Ipsos poll, with 92% in favor. Independents mirror the full population, with 54% in support of the Senate convicting Trump and prohibiting him from holding office, and 45% against.
Although the Senate trial begins on Tuesday, freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, not Trump, is who captured lawmakers' attention in the lead up to it. The rebuke of the Republican's past extremist comments may have contributed to how Americans are viewing her party in the new ABC News/Ipsos poll.
Twenty-five percent of Americans say they think there are more radical extremists in the Democratic Party than in the Republican Party, but 42% of Americans say the opposite; another 32% say they think there are about the same amount of extremists within both political parties.
On Thursday, the House voted to strip the Georgia congresswoman of her new committee assignments after the Republican conference, under pressure from Democrats, did not, even though there was widespread condemnation within the conference for her past comments. The House vote was bipartisan, with 11 Republicans joining Democrats to boot Greene off the two committees.
The push to remove Greene from committees, in particular the House Education and Labor Committee, came after media outlets reported on Greene's conspiracy-ridden and sometimes violence-promoting social media activity before she ran for office. In one video, Greene questioned whether a plane flew into the Pentagon on 9/11, and in another she implied House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should be executed. She also falsely suggested that the Sandy Hook and Parkland mass school shootings were staged.
Arguing that committee assignments should be handled within their party's conference, Republicans also accused their colleagues across the aisle of failing to hold their own members similarly accountable.
""While I'll continue to be consistent in my condemnation of offensive comments and inappropriate actions, I'm patiently awaiting Speaker Pelosi's resolution to remove Congressman [Eric] Swalwell from the House Intelligence Committee over his ties to a suspected Chinese Spy and Congresswoman [Ilhan] Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee for her shameful anti-Semitic comments,"" Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., said in a statement about her vote to remove Greene from her committees.
In the ABC News/Ipsos poll, however, Republicans and Democrats don't view each other equally in terms of extremism within the parties.
Among Democrats, 8 in 10 said that there are more radical extremists in the Republican Party than in their party, and 13% said there are about equal numbers of extremists in both parties.
However, among Republicans, 33% said there are about the same number of extremists in both parties while 57% said there are more extremists in the Democratic Party.

","Back at the end of March, when the coronavirus was first surging in the United States, polls showed Americans felt similarly about both likely presidential candidates' abilities to handle the pandemic. Three months later, that's changed, a new survey released from The Washington Post and ABC News finds.
The poll, released Sunday, shows the presumptive Democratic nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden, holding a 20-point advantage over President Trump when it comes to which candidate voters trust more to deal with the pandemic. In March, the two were all but even, with Trump actually holding onto a slight advantage. The president is still seen as the better bet to manage the economy effectively, although his margin is shrinking there, as well.

","ATLANTA — Plans for the final debate of Georgia’s raucous race for governor collapsed on Wednesday after the Republican nominee, Brian Kemp, abandoned the forum’s long-scheduled timing so he could campaign alongside President Trump this weekend.
Mr. Kemp had been expected to meet Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate, in a Sunday evening debate that was announced in September and was to be broadcast live. But Mr. Kemp backed away from the 5 p.m. debate in Atlanta after Mr. Trump’s campaign set a rally in Macon, about 100 miles to the southeast, for 4 p.m.
The upending of the debate calendar set off an hourslong quarrel that seemed likely to reverberate and resurface through the final days of an election cycle that was already acrimonious. By the time trick-or-treaters were knocking on doors on Wednesday evening, Mr. Kemp had agreed to a different time for the debate — 7:30 p.m. on Monday, the night before the election — but Ms. Abrams’s campaign balked at altering the terms of a debate that were set more than seven weeks ago.
“We believe it would be irresponsible to break our commitment to accommodate his failures,” Lauren Groh-Wargo, Ms. Abrams’s campaign manager, said in a statement on Wednesday night. “We refuse to callously take Georgians for granted and cancel on them. Just because Brian Kemp breaks his promises doesn’t mean anyone else should.”"

","Trump felt that public sentiment was on his side when it came to the player protests, and was warning that he would not back off. That conversation with Jones, and separate ones with the Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross and the New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft, suggested that the league was allowing their fear of Trump to influence how it dealt with Kaepernick and the other protesters.
Had Kaepernick’s case gone further, there was no question that more sensitive and damaging information would have come out. Who knows what was said about Kaepernick or other players in texts and emails. Even if Kaepernick had lost the case, the NFL would have been left with a significant mess.
Some are already criticizing Kaepernick for settling, not realizing how rare it is to see the NFL backed into a corner, especially by a player. Tom Brady, arguably the greatest quarterback ever, couldn’t beat the NFL in court. Even he eventually had to accept his four-game suspension for Deflategate in 2016.
Read: How Trump turned Kaepernick’s protest into a success
That Kaepernick was the one to make the NFL eat crow is a special kind of karma. This is just punishment because the league incompetently handled the player protests, starting with Kaepernick’s, from the beginning. Had the league not been so heavy-handed in policing the protests, this issue likely would have abated sooner. Had the league ignored Trump instead of cowering to his bullying, appeasing Trump wouldn’t have become a priority. Had one league owner had the guts to sign Kaepernick, this collusion case would have been a nonstarter.
But too often the NFL has shown an embarrassing commitment to being on the wrong side of history for the sake of profits. The league settled a $1 billion class-action concussion lawsuit brought by former players, but in the process, the NFL wasted a lot of time looking absolutely foolish denying its culpability. And regardless of the money it spent trying to make the issue go away, concussions and head trauma still haven’t disappeared from the public consciousness.
I still doubt that Kaepernick will ever play in the NFL again, but the point of suing the NFL wasn’t necessarily about resuming his football career. It was about holding the league accountable for something that was entirely preventable.
Though this legal battle with Kaepernick has been resolved, he isn’t going away either. The league will forever have to live with the fact that it was complicit in destroying someone’s career simply because he wished to bring attention to the injustices suffered by his people. If owners and Roger Goodell believe that they no longer will have to face questions about why Kaepernick isn’t in the league, they’re wrong. No matter what an arbitrator rules, how the NFL treated Kaepernick will always be the mistake they can never amend."

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. ― Thousands of white supremacists and armed militia groups faced off with counter-protesters during a violent and chaotic rally that raged for hours in this Virginia city on Saturday, resulting in the deaths of at least three people. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who declared a state of emergency Saturday afternoon, condemned the violence during a press conference that evening, sending a message to the white supremacists. “Our message is plain and simple: Go home. You are not wanted in this great commonwealth,” he said. “Shame on you.” “Please go home and never come back. Take your hatred, and take your bigotry,” McAuliffe added. Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas said 35 people were treated for injuries by city personnel on Saturday, with injuries ranging from minor to life-threatening. Three people died Saturday, including a 32-year-old woman who was hit by a car that plowed into a group of counter-demonstrators and two others who perished in a helicopter crash near the protests. James Alex Fields Jr., 20, was arrested in connection with the car incident. He was charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of failing to stop at an accident resulting in a death, police Col. Martin Kumer told HuffPost. “It was just terrifying,” said 23-year-old Thomas Pilnik, a Charlottesville resident who witnessed the crash. “I remember people flying into me, telling me to run and get out of the way and watching people fly like they were just bowling pins.”

As of 10 p.m. Eastern on Saturday, police had made three other arrests related to the rally:

“You came here today to hurt people and you did hurt people,” McAuliffe said at Saturday’s press conference. Groups in Charlottesville beat each other with flagpoles and bats, threw punches, chanted slogans and used chemical sprays on each other at a downtown park. Some reporters covering the event were doused in raw sewage. “There was a cloud,” said a witness, who asked not to be named. “Things were flying. Most people managed to get out of the way.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Saturday night that U.S. Attorney Rick Mountcastle has opened a federal investigation into the violence at the rally, with the full support of the Justice Department. The U.S. attorney’s office and regional FBI office also announced a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the deadly car crash. “The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice,” Sessions said in a statement. “When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.”

The “Unite the Right” rally was promoted by white nationalist Richard Spencer and drew several different groups, including activists from the so-called “alt-right,” Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members and other white supremacists, some of whom dressed in militia uniforms and were openly carrying long guns. Counter-demonstrators and anti-fascist groups also attended. After demonstrations got heated Friday night, tensions were running high even before the rally officially began at noon, with members of the “alt-right” chanting the Nazi phrase “Blood and soil!” and “White lives matter!” as they marched toward Emancipation Park. With Confederate flags and Nazi memorabilia on full display, they also chanted “Fuck you faggots!” James Allsup, who was in Charlottesville for the “Unite the Right” rally, told Mediaite that “white people are tired of being told by the cosmopolitan elites that we are the problem.” “This is the biggest racist rally in recent memory,” a 23-year-old anti-fascist from Michigan, who wouldn’t give his name, told HuffPost. “And we are all out here opposing these motherfuckers and trying to get a temperature check where the right is ― where the far right is at ― and how they’re organizing, and where we can apply radical strategies to defeat fascism.”

Early Saturday, McAuliffe asked on Twitter for a stop to the violence.
The acts and rhetoric in #Charlottesville over past 24 hours are unacceptable & must stop. A right to speech is not a right to violence. — Terry McAuliffe (@GovernorVA) August 12, 2017
As violence among the groups grew on Saturday morning, some fled the scene, while others coughed and cried from the chemical sprays. Two fences and a line of cops helped separate the opposing groups, though police did not immediately intervene in the violence. Police donned riot gear as fights escalated. Meanwhile, hundreds more white supremacists joined in the fray through the afternoon, making their way under a banner hung by the city that read “Diversity makes us stronger.”
Those standing on the sidelines were baffled as to why police weren’t immediately stopping the skirmishes. “If this were Ferguson, riot gear, tear gas, everything would have been used,” said Anthony Bennett, a pastor from Connecticut, referring to the Missouri town where protests broke out in August 2014 after Darren Wilson, at the time a police officer, shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. “There’s a different standard here in Charlottesville.”

Late Friday night, a white nationalist march at the University of Virginia campus painted a sobering picture of what was to come. A torch-bearing procession of hundreds that included Spencer, at least one man wearing a Nazi SS T-shirt and another carrying a bat, ended with a clash at the campus rotunda where a Thomas Jefferson statue stands. Spencer admitted on Twitter that a group surrounded counter-protesters at the statue. Counter-protesters told HuffPost that some among their ranks were then hit with some type of irritant Friday night ― they claim it was Mace, unleashed by the white supremacists. Protesters on the fringe left, who come to these events to battle the fringe right, often try to hide their identities for fear of retaliation. Some counter-protesters threatened a HuffPost reporter with a gun when he attempted to photograph, from a distance, those recovering from the irritant. “Don’t make me use my gun on you,” a woman said, grabbing a holster on her hip.

Punches and torches were thrown during the fracas, but local police eventually dispersed the crowds. President Donald Trump did little to denounce the white supremacists, instead saying Saturday that “many sides” were responsible for the violence. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides ― on many sides,” Trump said at a ceremony for the signing of a bill to reform the Veterans Affairs health care system. “It’s been going on for a long time in our country, not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It’s been going on for a long, long time.” Comments from state and local officials addressed the racism more directly. Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer spoke out against the white supremacists who gathered in his city. “They do not agree with the rules of democracy and they are on the losing side of history,” he said during a press conference Saturday evening. McAuliffe spoke directly to white supremacists during the press conference, reminding them that “we are a nation of immigrants.” McAuliffe said he spoke to Trump on Saturday and told the president he’d be willing to work together, despite their differences, to help prevent this kind of violence in the future. “There has got to be a movement in this country to bring people together,” McAuliffe said. The rally Saturday was thinly disguised on Facebook as an event in support of the statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee downtown, which is slated for removal as the city works to respect diverse voices in its telling of American history. It’s part of a nationwide effort to remove Confederate monuments from public property.
Andy Campbell / HuffPost Nazis came in droves to a rally in Virginia.
According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, more than 60 Confederate symbols have been removed from city- and state-owned land across the U.S. since avowed white supremacist Dylann Roof massacred nine parishioners at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. Most recently, the city of New Orleans toppled four statues honoring the Confederacy. “These efforts have made us a target for folks around the country who oppose telling the full story of race,” Signer told HuffPost on Friday. “They don’t want the narrative changed or to tell the full story of race. I think this will have the effect of redoubling our progress. To become an honest society, I don’t think we have any choice but to tell the full story.” The rally’s real purpose, however, shines through in the event’s advertising, which looks a lot like Nazi propaganda and reads like a poorly billed concert:

Some years ago, while we were getting ready to move out of state, my husband and I held a garage sale. We’d advertised it in our community newspaper and on flyers around the neighborhood and had a huge turnout as a result. Dozens of bargain hunters milled about, asking about this or that item. “Cuanto quiere usted por el sofá?” an older gentleman asked me, pointing to our old green couch. I quoted him a price, adding, “Es un sofá cama.” Hearing our exchange, a white woman turned around and yelled, “Speak English! You’re in America.” “Hey—” I said, but she walked away in a huff, got into her car, and drove off.
I’ve been thinking about that moment, and the fiery anger behind it, as I hear about incident after incident in which white people lash out at people of color in public spaces. There’s the white lawyer who berated the workers at a Manhattan deli for speaking Spanish—insisting that “I pay for their welfare. I pay for their ability to be here. The least they can do is speak English”—and then threatened to report them to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. There’s the white student who reported a black student for taking a nap in the common room of their dorm at Yale, saying, “I have every right to call the police—you cannot sleep in that room.” And there’s the white mother who called the police about two Native American students taking part in a campus tour at Colorado State University, telling the dispatcher that “they are not, definitely not, a part of the tour.”
The language in these complaints—“I pay,” “I have every right,” “they are definitely not”—is quite illuminating. It indicates a belief on the part of these white people that they are the custodians of public space and can enlist the police to enforce its boundaries. The offenses committed by people of color are arbitrary and nearly limitless: waiting too long at a Starbucks in Philadelphia, having a barbecue on Lake Merritt in Oakland, playing a leisurely game of golf at a club in Pennsylvania, checking out of an Airbnb in Rialto, California. And once police officers get there, anything can happen, ranging from an arrest on charges of trespassing to the installation of a police perimeter and the arrival of a police helicopter.
To be sure, the belief that public space belongs exclusively to white people is not new, and this redlining has been inflicting trauma on people of color for a long time now. Whether it’s on the street, in a café, or at an airport, the visibility of people of color in public is tolerated only so long as it does not disturb the comfort of the dominant group. But the ubiquitous presence of smartphones with cameras has helped to document such incidents, and social media have brought them to national attention. That’s a useful development: The assertion of private authority over public space now comes with a social cost.

That is what happened to Aaron Schlossberg, the Manhattan lawyer who threatened to call ICE on the Spanish-speaking food workers and customers in New York. His law practice soon plummeted in customer ratings; he was hounded by reporters seeking comment; and his corporate landlord terminated his business lease. Protesters even brought a mariachi band to perform outside his apartment building. The public shaming that followed his rant could have a salutary effect: Maybe, just maybe, racists will think twice before making frivolous reports or issuing threats.
Few people have come to Schlossberg’s defense, yet there are some who say that the popular outcry against him is “unnerving” and constitutes harassment by modern mobs who demand nothing less than “conformity of thought.” Online mobs are scary, no doubt about that. But Schlossberg’s rant doesn’t amount to a civilized difference of opinion; it’s racism, pure and simple, followed by threats.
Schlossberg’s assertion of authority over public space is, of course, protected from government interference by the First Amendment. But that right doesn’t protect him from the social consequences of his speech, including disruption and discomfort. Those protesting Schlossberg’s actions are, in fact, exercising their own free-speech rights to object to his racism and nativism. The simple truth is that if racist behavior is insulated from social shaming, it will likely continue and multiply until it becomes accepted. What happens when a majority of Americans hold views like Schlossberg’s? Current Issue View our current issue
The history of this country is replete with examples of how public space was regulated to ensure that one racial group was made comfortable at the expense of others. This is why it’s important to speak out, and speak out now. Allies can help to stop the harassment, or at least deflect it. In the cell-phone footage of Schlossberg’s rant, for example, an Asian man can be seen interposing himself between the lawyer and one of the Spanish-speaking women he’s verbally abusing. In the Philadelphia Starbucks incident, an older white man repeatedly challenged police officers about why they were arresting the two black men when they’d done nothing wrong.
At the garage sale that day, after the woman took off in a huff, I turned to my husband in disbelief. “Did you just hear what that lady said?” I asked him. This question, I now realize, was an attempt at documenting the moment by having a witness for it. It was my first intimation that people’s relationship to public space is political, and that some of us move through it under surveillance by others. “I heard,” my husband replied, and then told me of many similar experiences he’d had as a Cuban American here in Los Angeles.
But public space belongs to everyone. If racists don’t like hearing Spanish being spoken in a deli, or having Native American teens on a campus tour, or seeing black folks going on about their lives, they should just stay home."

","A Toddler's Death Adds To Concerns About Migrant Detention
Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy Yazmin Juárez Courtesy Yazmin Juárez
The death of a toddler is renewing concerns about the quality of medical care that immigrant families receive in federal detention centers.
Eighteen-month-old Mariee Juárez died after being detained along with her mother Yazmin Juárez at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. Her mother says Mariee was a happy, healthy child when they arrived at the U.S. border in March to seek asylum.
Then they were sent to Dilley. Six weeks after being discharged, her mother says, Mariee died of a treatable respiratory infection that began during her detention.
""The conditions at Dilley were unsanitary, unsafe and inappropriate for any small child,"" said R. Stanton Jones, a lawyer at the firm Arnold & Porter, which is representing Yazmin Juárez.
The conditions ...were unsanitary, unsafe and inappropriate for any small child.
When Juárez raised concerns about her daughter's deteriorating condition, he alleges, she wasn't taken seriously. ""The medical care that Mariee received in Dilley was neglectful and substandard,"" Jones said.
Doctors and immigrant advocates have long complained about the medical care at family detention centers overseen by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. Dilley is the largest of three such facilities, with 2,400 beds.
Those concerns have taken on new urgency as the Trump administration looks to detain more migrant families. In June, ICE requested space to accommodate 15,000 additional beds.
ICE declined to comment on the details of Mariee's case, which was first reported by VICE News. But the agency says it takes the welfare of immigrants in its care seriously.
""ICE is committed to ensuring the welfare of all those in the agency's custody, including providing access to necessary and appropriate medical care,"" ICE said in an emailed statement. ""Staffing includes registered nurses and licensed practical nurses, licensed mental health providers, mid-level providers that include a physician's assistant and nurse practitioner, a physician, dental care, and access to 24-hour emergency care.""
But a pediatrician who reviewed Mariee's medical records says she did not receive adequate care in Dilley.
""Nobody at any time decided to actually have a pediatrician or a doctor see the child,"" said Benard Dreyer, the director of pediatrics at the Bellevue Hospital Center in New York, and a past president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Dreyer reviewed Mariee's medical records from her time at Dilley at the request of her mother's lawyers, and says that nurses and physician assistants overlooked several high fevers, and other signs that Mariee's respiratory infection was getting worse.
""Can we guarantee that if [she] had been sent to the hospital a week earlier, it wouldn't have been too late? I can't guarantee that,"" Dreyer said. But he adds, ""the child was very sick and should have been sent to a hospital.""
Instead, Yazmin Juárez's lawyers say, Mariee was simply discharged from Dilley without ever seeing a doctor. Juárez and her daughter were driven to the airport in San Antonio. They flew to New Jersey, where Juárez took Mariee to the emergency room.
Mariee spent the last weeks of her life in hospitals. She died on May 10 of respiratory failure.
Her mother's lawyers signaled on Tuesday that they intend to sue. They're seeking seeking $40 million in damages for Mariee's ""wrongful death"" from the city of Eloy, Ariz. (Eloy is official contractor for Dilley under an unusual arrangement with the Department of Homeland Security and CoreCivic, the private prison company that operates the facility).
More lawsuits are expected to follow.
Doctors and immigrant rights advocates who are familiar with medical care in Dilley and other family detention centers say they're not surprised by Mariee's death.
In July, two doctors contracted by the Department of Homeland Security released a scathing assessment of care at those facilities. Scott Allen and Pamela McPherson conducted 10 investigations of family detention centers over the past four years, and found widespread problems with inadequate staffing and poor training.
""The threats to health and safety of the children are not merely theoretical,"" Allen and McPherson wrote. Family detention is ""an exploitation and an assault on the dignity and health of children and families."""

""This is what they want, for him to do this,"" she said.
""Of course. No president -- nobody that's ever walked into that office as soon as NATO was formed has ever thought for one second about shutting down NATO. Not one second.

Liberal,"https://www.rawstory.com/2018/09/yale-psychiatrist-says-trump-getting-worse-suspect-unable-tolerate-reality/
","Two weeks ago, the New York Times published an anonymous op-ed by a senior Trump administration official who was deeply concerned about President Trump's mental health and his authoritarian tendencies. (Don Foster, a retired scholar who specializes in textual analysis -- and correctly identified Joe Klein as the author of ""Primary Colors"" -- thinks he knows who that person is.)
For the New York Times to publish such an op-ed, and for a White House official to warn the American people and the world about a dangerous president is unprecedented in the country's history. But the article was not surprising to at least one person. Bandy Lee, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine, says she was contacted last year by White House insiders, who were ""scared"" that the president was ""unraveling.""
Lee has been tracking the apparent decline in Donald Trump's mental health for several years. She has convened a conference on the obligation of mental health professionals to warn the public about the dangers he represents, and is also the editor of the bestselling book ""The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.""
Will Donald Trump's mental health continue to decline? In what ways is special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation exacerbating Trump's apparent mental and emotional unraveling? How do collective narcissism and violence tie Donald Trump to his supporters? Are Trump's authoritarian impulses connected to his mental health? Is the safety of the world imperiled by Donald Trump's access to nuclear weapons?
This conversation has been edited for clarity and length.
What was your first reaction when the New York Times published the anonymous op-ed by a White House official?
I was not surprised. I was struck by how the op-ed was being treated as such a big deal. I think it’s admirable that the writer chose to divulge the information about Donald Trump's very dangerous and worrisome behavior. But in many ways Trump's behavior was expected. As mental health professionals, we see the psychological symptoms in process so the result and outcome are very often not that surprising. So as events unfold, it’s merely a playing out of what was inevitable with Trump's paranoia and trying to hunt down the person in the White House who wrote the New York Times op-ed.
You have said that two officials in the White House actually reached out to you last year with their fears about Donald Trump's mental health.
That occurred during October of last year. There were two phone calls saying that these persons were from the White House. They seemed very credible and very genteel over the phone. They were very respectful. They were calling because they found me to be credible based on the book I edited about Donald Trump's mental health. These people were trying to figure out a solution and really just asking for help.
The anonymous New York Times op-ed is a cry for help -- which is how I read it as a mental health professional. It's all very understandable, in a way, because mental impairment can be quite overwhelming and powerful in ways that regular people who are not used to seeing such mental symptoms can be caught unaware. They will also often be left at a loss as to how to respond, because the mental health symptoms being reported about Donald Trump can overcome healthy individuals through their sheer force.
So much of this is predictable from a clinical standpoint. Trump is not going to get better. What are his symptoms?
Donald Trump has shown a number of symptoms which are now quite obvious to even an untrained person. He is impulsive. He is reckless. He has shown a lack of empathy and a lack of concern about consequences. His grip on reality is loose. I suspect he is unable to tolerate reality for what it is. So, Trump has to make himself into a person who is infallible and an expert on everything.
Therefore, when reality does not comport with his emotional needs, he has to fabricate his own version of reality. Trump has also shown a tendency of needing to present himself as being strong and powerful. He is constantly preoccupied with his self-image, he is unable to tolerate criticism and he lashes out when there is a hint of anyone being against him or challenging his authority. The truth of the matter is quite the opposite. Trump's behavior is a sign of weakness, not strength.
Is Trump's behavior somehow strategic, as a means of keeping the public and his political enemies confused? Or is this all just impulse and instinct, a sign of his mental instability?
Both elements are at work. He tries to strategize. But when someone is behaving in a way that is caused by their mental impairment, their behavior becomes predictable and rather rigid. Normal behavior is actually very wide-ranging. You can choose not to behave a certain way, you can change your method, you can change your responses. That's a more healthy response. In Donald Trump's case, we find that his responses are almost always predictable.
For example, the denial of any failure or error in Puerto Rico. That can be very effective, and therefore be mistaken for strategy. But it is actually impairment. Donald Trump can't, for example, decide to think more carefully or respond more thoughtfully to events. He simply reacts. That is one of the ways that we can determine that his behavior is more of a symptom than a thoughtful strategic response.
This makes Trump vulnerable to being manipulated by a foreign power (or others) who do not have the American people's best interests at heart.
Those who have figured out that Trump is predictable can stroke his ego or present themselves as being ""strong men,"" autocrats and the like -- he will start to worship you and behave in ways that are advantageous to you. This is why I believe Trump has been so difficult to remove through the 25th Amendment, impeachment or other checks and balances, because he is so amenable and easy to manipulate. This means that all variety of extreme policies which wouldn't have passed under a healthier president are possible under this one.
So the psychological and emotional issues actually play into his authoritarian behavior and his demagoguery?
Authoritarian behavior is actually pathology. It is a certain set of traits which makes individuals vulnerable to being controlled. We think of authoritarian behavior as being strong and confident, but actually it's more obsequious. There is a whole population following the authoritarian and being loyal to him no matter what. He leads them to destruction and the end results are almost always quite devastating -- which is why it's actually not a healthy situation. A system like despotism or tyranny or fascism is really not a political ideology so much as a collective state of poor health that leads eventually to harm for the collective body.
I have argued that Trump leads a political cult tied together by racism and other antisocial behavior, and that it is all evidence of collective narcissism. Trump is personally violent and has also encouraged violence by his supporters.
He thrives on fear and anger. Trump stokes that to his advantage. One of the reasons that my colleagues and I said that Trump was dangerous during his campaign was because he incites violence. He is attracted to violence. Trump will continually wish to either provoke or be drawn to violence himself -- such as starting a war, even a nuclear war. Nuclear weapons will be especially attractive to him because of their destructive power. That power won't deter Trump, but rather may draw him to more violence. It is all connected. The incitement of violence in the population, the attraction to war and division, and powerful weapons.
There has been an increase in hate crimes, beginning with Trump's campaign and through almost two years of his presidency. Bullying among children has increased. There are mass shootings. Violence seems to be spreading in Trump's America.
Pathology itself is spreading. It can be seen as something that's contagious. Violence is learned behavior. So when you present violence as a viable response to conflict -- and not only do you reward people who act violently, but you glorify it and show it as a valid means of resolving problems -- then yes, there's plenty of evidence showing that children will learn to be violent.
This is a predictable consequence of rewarding not just an aggressive violent person to the office of presidency but also the rhetoric he uses and the climate he encourages. The greatest danger that Mr. Trump is posing to our nation at this point and internationally is the culture of violence that he's laying the groundwork for. There has been an escalating gun murder rate since Trump's campaign and presidency. There are also the highest gun murder rates in 25 years and epidemics of suicide which are at the highest levels in decades.
READ MORE: I was wrong about the ""blue wave"": It's here. But where will it land and what does it mean?
You and your fellow mental health professionals have continued to issue public warnings about Donald Trump's danger to the country and the world. What are some of the specifics?
We recently put out a statement that special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s investigations are likely to provoke Donald Trump into taking extreme and dangerous measures to try to distract the public.
The same would apply with the revelations that are coming forth with Robert Woodward's book or the New York Times op-ed, his diminishing popularity -- all these things are going to be additional stresses on an already stressed presidency. His level of lying -- it's already at a pathological level, but the Washington Post noted that his rate of lying has quadrupled. In other words, in the first six months of this year he lied twice as much as he did in the entire preceding year.
All those are signs of deterioration: His increasingly angry tweets, his resorting to more and more fantastical versions of reality, his conspiracy theories -- the deep state and so forth. These are signs of deterioration and we're treading dangerously close to something devastating happening. When we make predictions, we’re not saying that something will definitely happen, but when the probability exceeds a certain level of acceptability, then mental health professionals have a duty to warn and to alert the public. That's why we've been speaking up all this time, but the situation has become much more dire.
It is unfortunate that we don’t have a political solution at this point. The correct response and treatment would involve containment -- and denying Trump access to nuclear weapons.
How does Trump's denying that thousands of people were killed in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria reflect his mental health? Likewise, on the anniversary of 9/11, Trump was acting inappropriately as well, celebrating and congratulating himself as he got off Air Force One.
That just shows how Trump lacks basic human qualities. This is actually a very debilitating, impairing condition where he is unable to have empathy for other people. Trump is so focused on himself, and probably always preoccupied with protecting himself and survival of the self. Those of us who have a basic sense of self-worth, and are grounded in our ability to accept ourselves and to see ourselves as being significant, don't have need to constantly be on guard or constantly attack imaginary threats. It is all revealing of his level of fragility.
Trump doesn't seem to have an internal sensor that says, ""This is wrong"". Instead it is just literally, “Here's what I feel. I'm going to do it.""
Trump doesn't have that internal restraint. He has to constantly guard himself unless he's getting perpetual adulation and approval from others. He truly feels as if he's catastrophically in danger of losing himself. That is why something like a devastating nuclear war would not be inconceivable to him. Trump has built himself up to be as the undefeatable, powerful, all-knowing person. If that façade were to crumble, then it will feel as if the entire universe were crumbling as well. It would become very attractive for Trump to launch a war or to use nuclear weapons. We know from his speeches, his own words, that he's very attracted to nuclear weapons. Trump has even asked, “Why do we have them if we don't use them?”
All his actions are in preparation for something like a nuclear war. I wouldn't be surprised if that would be the first place he goes. This is quite beyond the imagination of most people. We can't even conceive of that being a response, let alone a response that we would take, because a normal person would think about the level of devastation and the consequences. But Donald Trump is unable to think of consequences, as far as we can tell.
Trump has shown a detachment from reality, and of being someone who has shown a severely impaired ability to be empathetic. Trump also has shown a level of cruelty and pleasure in inflicting pain on others. Everything is going in the direction of something very harmful and devastating. It's only a matter of the stress rising to the level where Trump would make such a decision, to start a war or use nuclear weapons. This is a very dangerous situation.
But ordinary people will tend to think that “Well, he won't go that far, he won't do this.” In other words, he wouldn't destroy himself and human civilization. That's an assumption on our part based on normal behavior. What mental health professionals can perhaps do for society is to educate the public on how serious the signs Trump is manifesting really are.
Mental health professionals routinely assess, treat and contain individuals like Donald Trump on a daily basis. It's routine. There are medical standards of response, even if it is not happening at the political level where it should. Usually, with an individual like Donald Trump you need an urgent mental health evaluation. This has not happened yet, even though the need for one was indicated long ago."

","The Trump administration told a federal court Thursday evening that it would no longer defend the Affordable Care Act (ACA), arguing that protections for people with pre-existing conditions are unconstitutional.
The Justice Department filed the brief supporting a lawsuit from Texas and 19 other Republican-led states. In their complaint, the states argue the courts must invalidate the entire ACA because Congress zeroed out the individual mandate, the penalty for not having insurance.
The norm is for the federal government to defend federal law, but the Trump administration, instead, agreed with the 20 conservative states. The Justice Department lawyers stopped short of arguing that the entire law, including Medicaid expansion, should be struck down, but did say that the provisions protecting people with pre-existing conditions should now be ruled unconstitutional.
It’s not unprecedented for the Justice Department to decide against defending federal law in court; the Obama administration didn’t defend the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996, which prohibited married same-sex couples from receiving federal benefits. But, the Justice Department concluded, as the University of Michigan’s Nicholas Bagley points out, that it was no longer constitutionally defensible to deny equal rights to LGBTQ people. That said, it’s rare, and law and health experts alike are jolted by the news.

“Although the ACA is not in immediate peril, the brief represents an enormous blow to the integrity of the Justice Department,” writes Bagley, an ACA law expert. “It also displays enormous contempt for the rule of law.”
The brief “was so radical, and so self-evidently without merit, that career lawyers in that agency would not sign their names to it. In fact, the document is such a transparent embarrassment that three career lawyers involved in the case withdrew their appearance before it was filed, presumably to avoid the taint of being listed on a docket where it appeared,” wrote Ian Samuel and Leah Litman, of Harvard Law School and University of California at Irvine, School of Law, respectively.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised to protect people with pre-existing conditions, but Thursday’s move proves that was an empty promise. When Congressional Republicans were working to repeal and replace the ACA, he said his health plan would take “care of pre-existing conditions.” But now his administration is unwilling to defend such people in court. Instead, California and 15 other states intervened in the lawsuit, filing a brief Thursday to defend the ACA.
It’s unlikely, but should conservative states win, roughly 130 million people with pre-existing conditions are at risk of being denied insurance or charged more for care.

The news also comes at a critical time for the ACA marketplace. Insurance companies are currently setting ACA premium rates for 2019, and also are deciding whether to continue selling plans on the marketplace. In May 2017, there were several counties where no insurers offered ACA health plans. By September, all were filled.

","With COVID-19 cases soaring nationally, Americans by nearly a two to one margin distrust what President Donald Trump says about the pandemic, and six in 10 in a new ABC News/Washington Post poll disapprove of how he’s handling it, up steeply since the early days of the outbreak.
Just 38% in the national survey now approve of Trump’s response, down from 46% in late May and a narrow majority, 51%, in late March, a 13-point drop. Disapproval gained 15% in the same period, to 60%.
See PDF for full results, charts and tables.
Among Trump’s challenges is his credibility on the issue in this poll, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates. Only 34% of Americans place a great deal or good amount of trust in what he says about COVID-19, while 64% trust him not so much or – in the case of nearly half the public – not at all.
There’s also a disconnect in terms of priorities, with Americans, by 63-33%, saying it’s more important to control the spread of the virus than to restart the economy, a goal Trump has stressed. That 30-point preference for controlling the spread has widened from 20 points in late May.
Concern about catching the disease, moreover, remains persistently high. Sixty-six percent are very or somewhat worried that they or someone in their immediate family might become infected, and an additional 5% of Americans now say this already has happened.
Masks
In terms of protective action, 79% say they wear a mask all or most of the time when they’re around other people outside their home. Fewer, 57%, say they do so all of the time without exception.
Trust in Trump – and political views more broadly – interact with this behavior. Among people who generally trust what the president says on the issue, 41% say they always wear a mask around other people. That jumps to 66% among those who generally don’t trust him.
In strictly partisan terms, 38% of Republicans and those who lean Republican report always wearing a mask when they’re near others outside their home; this nearly doubles, to 70%, among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.
Among other factors, always wearing a mask also is associated with ideology (it’s 71% among liberals while 38% among very conservative adults); age (42% among 18- to 29-year-olds vs. 61% among those 30 and older); and race (about 20 points lower among whites than among Black or Hispanic people). It’s also 20 points lower in rural areas compared with cities.
Most strikingly, wearing a mask is associated with worry about becoming infected. Always wearing one ranges from 81% among people who are very worried about catching the virus to 22% among those who aren’t worried at all. That suggests that the barrier to mask wearing – widely urged by public health officials – isn’t a lack of confidence that they work, but the level of public doubt that the situation is threatening enough to warrant it.
Another potential factor – state orders to wear masks – shows a more modest effect. In states where such orders were in place as of Sunday, when interviewing for this survey began, 60% say they always wear masks, compared with 51% in states with no such orders.
A statistical analysis called regression, holding all available factors constant, finds that worry about catching the virus is by far the single strongest predictor of wearing a mask. Other factors include being conservative and living in a rural area, both negative predictors of mask-wearing; and, as positive predictors, age, education, strongly prioritizing controlling the spread of the virus, living in a state with a mask mandate, living in counties with higher per-capita cases and being female.
Worry
Being worried about catching the virus is associated with partisanship and ideology, and, perhaps surprisingly, is not strongly related to the number of cases in one’s state or county. Eighty percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are worried about becoming infected, compared with 50% of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. The gap is similar between liberals and those who are very conservative, 82% vs. 48%, with moderates in between.
Worry also is higher among Hispanics (78%) and Black people (74%), compared with 61% among whites.
Worry about catching the virus tends to be lowest in counties with the fewest cases, or the least recent growth in cases, whether overall or per capita, in quartiles.
Trump
Approval of Trump’s handling of the situation, and trust in what he says about it, again are highly partisan. His approval rating for handling the pandemic is 79% among Republicans, but 39% among independents and a mere 4% among Democrats. Since late March, he’s lost 21 points in approval on the issue among Democrats, while losing 9 points among independents and Republicans alike.
Trump’s rating has lost 15 to 16 points since late March in the Midwest, South and West alike, while essentially unchanged in the Northeast, where he started lower. Notably, too, while he’s better-rated in rural areas – albeit just with 48% approval – he’s lost 23 points there, as well as 16 points in suburban areas and 9 points in urban centers.
In an especially wide gap, Trump’s performance wins approval from 78% of those who prioritize restarting the economy, while plummeting to 17% of those who say it’s more important to control the spread of the virus.
Indeed, in a regression, views on controlling the spread of the virus vs. restarting the economy are the single strongest independent predictor of views of Trump’s handling of the situation (with strong preference for controlling the spread negatively predicting his performance). The next strongest factors are being a Republican and a conservative, both associated with approval of Trump; and being worried about catching the coronavirus and being a Democrat, both negative predictors. Education and being a Black person also are significant negative predictors.
Trust in what the president says also is highly influenced by partisanship. It’s 71% among Republicans, lower than his typical overall approval ratings within the party, dropping to 30% among independents and 6% of Democrats. Among other factors, trust in the president is lowest, 24%, in the counties with the most COVID-19 cases per capita, though it’s not high in other counties, 37%.

","Shortly before 8:30 a.m. on Dec. 21, as his fellow lawmakers met upstairs, state Rep. Mike Nearman walked casually out of the Oregon Capitol.
THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor
Video surveillance footage shows Nearman did not break stride as he passed far-right demonstrators gathered immediately outside the door, demanding entrance to a building closed to the public because of COVID-19. Nor did Nearman take any steps to stop those demonstrators as they held ajar the door he had just opened and immediately began signaling others to crowd inside.
In short, the footage obtained by OPB Friday morning shows clearly what House Speaker Tina Kotek and others have described in recent days: Nearman appearing to — blatantly, purposefully — allow an incursion into the state Capitol.
A hectic and potentially dangerous scene unfolded almost immediately after Nearman slipped out of the north side of the building. State troopers and Salem police officers, learning of the breach, immediately crowded the hallway, pushing back people who had begun to make their way into the working home of both the legislature and Gov. Kate Brown. After nearly 10 minutes of jostling, and with the crowd forced out of the building, police retreated after being hit with what they later described as “bear mace.”
Footage shows demonstrators hesitating after police fell back, apparently uncertain it was safe for them to proceed inside. Joey Gibson, the leader of the far-right group Patriot Prayer, is among those captured taking halting steps into the Capitol before retreating.
Eventually, though, demonstrators — some in military gear, some bearing the Confederate flag, many unmasked — made it deeper into the Capitol on Dec. 21, engaging in a standoff with police in a vestibule just off the building’s stately rotunda for nearly an hour. They chanted things like “enemies of the state,” and “arrest Kate Brown.”
Two demonstrators were arrested by the time police in riot gear finally cleared people from the building.

“A serious break of public trust”
Nearman may also face consequences.
The Republican from Independence is the subject of a criminal investigation, and he faces possible legislative discipline for his role in allowing a breach of the state Capitol that unnerved many lawmakers and has led to calls for increased security in the statehouse. Legislative leaders, all Democrats, could strip him of his legislative committee assignments — therefore diminishing his ability to have input — or file a formal workplace complaint that would lead to an investigation and potential sanctions by a House committee.
“OSP has confirmed and informed us that Rep. Mike Nearman did open a door to allow demonstrators into the building,” Kotek said Thursday. “This was a serious, serious breach of public trust. His actions put staff and legislators and law enforcement in danger.”
Nearman has not said much about his role. Asked about the matter Thursday, Nearman asked who had told OPB there was surveillance footage of him allowing people into the building. He otherwise declined to discuss the matter, repeating: “I don’t have anything to say.”
According to one source with knowledge of the matter, after exiting the building on the north side, Nearman immediately walked around the Capitol and used his ID to enter on the south side. By then, police were already wrestling demonstrators out of the Capitol.
House Republican Leader Christine Drazan, R-Canby, has not addressed Nearman’s conduct, despite repeated requests for comment by OPB.
The Dec. 21 demonstration outside the Capitol was billed by Patriot Prayer and other right-wing groups as a “flash mob.” The collected crowd had a variety of demands, from being allowed into the closed-off Capitol to an easing of state restrictions on businesses and schools meant to stop the spread of COVID-19 to the re-election of President Trump.
Chandler Pappas, a member of Patriot Prayer, was arrested Monday on accusations he maced officers at the rally.
Similar scenes have played out in front of the Capitol since, including a violent Jan. 6 rally that was declared an unlawful assembly by state police. That event did not result in damage to the statehouse."

","Maine Sen. Susan Collins is the first — and so far only — Republican senator to sign on to a bill guaranteeing back pay for federal contractors in the wake of the 35-day government shutdown. The bill would ensure that contractors, who typically haven’t received back pay in the past, also get paychecks for the time they missed as a result of the stalemate.
Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN), who is leading the legislation, has now gained support for the bill from more than 35 Democrats, but no Republicans had officially backed up the bill until this point, according to a spokesperson for Smith.
Smith and her colleagues say they are going to keep reaching across the aisle, with the hopes that Collins’s support could very well open the door for others to join her.
“I don’t know of any Republican opposition to this,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), a bill co-sponsor, told Vox. Van Hollen and Smith are aiming for the legislation to be included in any final spending package that funds the government before the February 15 deadline. In the House, Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) has also introduced a companion bill.
Many federal contractors, unlike other government employees, are not expected to get back pay for the paychecks they missed out on during the multi-week shutdown. Because they work for third-party companies that the government pays for their services, contractors don’t get paid when these services aren’t used. During past shutdowns, contractors have been forced to simply chalk up this gap in pay as a loss.
As many as 580,000 contractors, including cafeteria workers, security guards, and IT consultants, could be affected by the shutdown in this way, according to NYU public service professor Paul Light. (Depending on the company they work for, some contractors may have received their pay uninterrupted during the shutdown.)
For those who did see breaks in their wages, it’s a gaping hole they’re being asked to recover from with little recourse. “Thirty-five days is a historically long shutdown,” says Van Hollen. “The economic pain and damage was more severe [than past ones.] There are a lot of people who were left out in the cold for no fault of their own.”
Contractors have told Vox that they struggled with bills for everything from medication to baby formula to child care during the shutdown. As the Washington Post reported, some contractors even saw their health insurance coverage put on pause because their employers weren’t able to cover worker premiums.
While the shutdown is now over, its effects are expected to have an outsize impact on many workers for months to come.
What the Senate bill would do
The Senate bill, which has been dubbed the Fair Compensation for Low-Wage Contractor Employees Act, would require federal agencies to work directly with companies that contract to them in order to provide back pay for the employees caught up in the shutdown.
As Smith has explained, federal agencies have already allocated money in their budgets to cover contractor costs that have not been doled out because of the shutdown. Her bill would simply ask these agencies to pay out what they would have spent anyway.
“If you think about it, they’re paying people for work they would have done but for the shutdown,” Smith said. “In many cases, that money was already budgeted; it just hasn’t been spent.”
The bill is especially focused on providing full back pay for low-wage individuals, but would also offer some compensation for higher-income earners, according to Smith’s spokesperson. Agencies could provide workers up to $965 per week in back pay if the bill passes.
The legislation would also create a special account to pay out these funds, the senator said, noting that it expands a mechanism that already exists for reimbursing contractors for shutdown costs.
Agencies could actually pay contractors without any legislation
While legislation could help codify the practice of repaying federal contractors after a shutdown, agencies could actually directly pay out these contracts without any legislation at all, according to a union representative.
“The public should be aware that agencies do in fact have the ability to immediately and single-handedly provide workers back pay, without forcing members of Congress into the long and uphill battle of passing legislation,” said Jaime Contreras, a vice president of 32BJ SEIU, a union representing building services workers. “In this way, federal agencies are holding a lifeline to rescue workers who are drowning in bills through no fault of their own. Agencies must fulfill their moral and financial obligation to repay workers for a shutdown these men and women had nothing to do with.”
The Office of Management and Budget could direct agencies to examine their budgets and determine how much it would cost to cover contractor wages that were not paid out during the shutdown, the union representative added.
Prior to the end of the shutdown, House and Senate Democrats had urged OMB to do just that.
“Government contracts typically have provisions to modify the terms of the contract,” they wrote. “Federal contracting officers should use these provisions to work with contractors to provide back pay for employees who lost wages as a result of the government shutdown.”
OMB did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and Van Hollen said lawmakers haven’t heard back from the agency.
As things stand right now, both the administration and Congress are leaving contractors in the lurch."

","After Stinging Presidential Loss, Popular Vote Movement Gains Momentum In States
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP
An attempt at an Electoral College workaround is gaining momentum in the Mountain West.
Democrats in Colorado and New Mexico are pushing ahead with legislation to pledge their 14 collective electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote — no matter who wins each state.
The plan only goes into effect if the law passes in states representing an electoral majority. That threshold is 270 votes, which is the same number needed to win the presidency.
Democrats have been stung by the fact that President Trump's victory marked the second time in five cycles that a Democrat lost the presidency while winning the popular vote. 2016 was the most egregious example, with Hillary Clinton winning 3 million more votes than Donald Trump, but losing the election. It was the largest margin ever for someone who won the popular vote, but lost the Electoral College.
Proponents of the national popular vote measures have argued that it's not political, but Republicans, who have benefited in recent elections from the Electoral College system, disagree.
And while a majority of the country has expressed support for giving the presidency to the person who wins the most votes — 55 percent in the latest Pew Research Center poll — there are sharp partisan divides. Three-quarters of Democrats are in favor of amending the Constitution to do so, but less than a third of Republicans are.
So far, 11 states — including New York, California and New Jersey — have joined the effort along with the District of Columbia, putting the effort 98 votes short of its goal.
Colorado appears poised to join as the 12th state. The state legislature passed the bill Thursday, and Gov. Jared Polis is expected to sign it. In New Mexico, the legislation is awaiting consideration in the state Senate after the House approved it earlier this month.
If the bills pass, it would show the plan has momentum outside of the Coastal U.S., especially in places where Democrats have full control of state government.
John Koza devised the plan and chairs the organization behind it. Koza also co-invented the scratch lottery ticket and taught computer science at Stanford. He turned his attention to the Electoral College, however, after growing frustrated with ""winner-take-all"" laws.
Koza said the rules are why presidential candidates only campaign in a handful of states. He recognized what might be a potential loophole in the Constitution — that while the Electoral College is in the Constitution, nothing says a candidate who wins a state has to get all of its electoral votes.
""The political power to the choose the president was basically given by the founders to the state legislatures,"" Koza said. ""And over the years they've passed different laws specifying how to allocate their state's electoral votes.""
In fact, Maine and Nebraska do not have ""winner-take-all"" systems. They allocate their electoral votes to presidential candidates by congressional district, with an additional two electoral votes going to the winner of the state.
Colorado state Sen. Mike Foote, who's sponsoring legislation, insisted that it's not a partisan response to Trump's 2016 win. Rather, he said, it's about upholding the democratic principle of one person, one vote.
""It's about time that every vote in the country counts equally,"" he said. ""Right now, if you live in a state that is not a battleground state, then your vote doesn't count nearly as much.""
Bipartisan appeals have not gone far in Colorado. Not a single Republican voted for the bill as it moved through the state legislature. During a debate on the House floor, one Republican even suggested renaming the bill the ""We Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Hate Donald Trump Act of 2019.""
Republican state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg, who represents the plains east of Denver, worries about the impact of a popular vote on rural America. He said it would lead candidates to only campaign in the largest media markets, like New York and Los Angeles.
""You drop us from nine [electoral] votes to 5.5 million people, all of sudden Colorado is irrelevant,"" he said. ""This is all about making sure presidential candidates realize Colorado is important to the rest of the country.""
That partisan divide isn't limited to Colorado. Across the country, pollsters have seen a steep drop in Republican support for a popular vote for president since 2016. National Popular Vote's Koza said it has been much harder to get Republicans to support his plan in recent years.
While those opinions could change over time, it signals the compact is unlikely to succeed in the short-term. Only Democratic-leaning states have joined so far. Swing states, like Ohio and Florida, have the least reason to sign on, which means it likely needs support from deep red states.
There's also a broader question as to whether it would be constitutional. The Electoral College is clearly written into the nation's founding document. Some insist that Congress would have to approve it since it would overhaul national election procedures. Other scholars have argued that states can't bind their electors to voters outside their boundaries.
Koza insists Article II gives states broad power to decide how they choose electoral delegates. Still, he expects a series of lawsuits if enough of the National Popular Vote efforts went into effect.
Seth Masket, a political science professor at the University of Denver, said those legal battles are a long way off. In the short term, he sees it as a way to center a familiar debate over the unique way the country decides its president.
""It's about saying the status quo is unacceptable,"" he said. ""This might not be the best way of changing it, but it's at least a way of forcing some change and forcing some discussion of it.""

","If you'd been suspecting that Donald Trump's daily routine mostly consists of walking around the Oval Office, occasionally bumping into tables and wondering when he'll be allowed to go and have a lie down, you're not that far off. Axiom has got hold of Trump's private schedules for the last three months, and found that about 60 percent of his schedule is given over to that nebulous not-a-real-activity 'executive time'.
There's never been a strict definition of executive time - an idea thought up by Trump's former Chief of Staff John Kelly, who according to Bob Woodward's book Fear thought Trump was an ""idiot"" with the international affairs knowledge of an 11-year-old, to mollify Trump's dislike of rigid scheduling - but of the 502 hours and 55 minutes of scheduled time between 7 November 2018 and 1 February 2019, Trump spent 297 hours and 15 minutes on on it.
This content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.
Every day, Trump kicks off with three hours of executive time between 8am and 11am, a period generally understood to be when Trump pores over TV news and newspapers and ringing aides, friends and confidantes about his coverage.
The schedule says he's in the Oval Office, but six sources say that that never happens - instead he's kicking about in the White House residence. On some days executive time expands to fill the whole day, like the day after the midterm results when seven hours was allotted to executive time.
""He's always calling people, talking to people,"" a source told Axiom. ""He's always up to something; it's just not what you would consider typical structure.""
More worryingly, Axiom suggests that part of the reason that there's so much 'executive time' on the schedule is that Trump uses the time to make calls and hold meetings that he'd rather not have White House staff knowing too much about in case they leak it. For example, an executive time meeting with former Godfather's Pizza CEO Herman Cain only came out via a Bloomberg report.

","TAMPA — As vice president, Joe Biden leaned in to the goofy ""Uncle Joe"" caricature of memes and satirical news stories. He wore aviators for the cameras while eating ice cream, and pointed and grinned behind President Barack Obama during nationally televised speeches.
But at a Democratic campaign rally Monday at the University of South Florida, the audience saw a different side of Biden. ""Listen,"" he said over and over when the crowd wanted to laugh or cheer. ""This is not a joke.""
""I think there's something different about this election,"" Biden said. ""This election is bigger than politics. For real. This goes well beyond.""
This is the message Democrats in Florida led with on the first day of early voting in one of the key battleground states of these midterms, and they enlisted one of the party's most recognizable national figures to deliver it.
""American values are being shredded"" by President Donald Trump, Biden asserted, and Florida is needed to lead the Democratic counter punch. ""After Charlottesville, I could not be silent anymore. We're in the battle for the soul of America.""
OCTAVIO JONES | TimesFormer Vice-President Joe Biden, center, hugs U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson while Florida Gubernatorial Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum looks on during the Florida Democratic Party rally held at the University of South Florida in Tampa, Florida on Monday, October 22, 2018.
Biden kicked off a two-day trip to the Sunshine State in Tampa with Tallahassee mayor and gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and Sen. Bill Nelson. Two years after Trump took Florida by just 1.2 percentage points, the two Democrats are running neck-and-neck in their closely watched races.
Now 75, Biden is the biggest name to come through the area since late July, when Trump campaigned for Gillum's rival, Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis. Biden will remain in the Interstate 4 corridor on Tuesday to campaign with Nelson in Orlando, once again affirming the region's importance in statewide elections.
Speaking to a crowd of about 1,500 in a USF gym, Biden promised immediate change in Florida if voters put Democrats in charge of the state for the first time in 20 years.
Environmental officials will be allowed to say ""climate change"" again and Medicaid expansion will bring health care to 800,000 poor Floridians, Biden said, alluding to two flashpoints of Republican Gov. Rick Scott's administration.
""Andrew will change that overnight,"" Biden said.
OCTAVIO JONES | TimesFlorida Gubernatorial Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum takes selfies with the crowd after giving a speech during the Florida Democratic Party rally held at the University of South Florida in Tampa, Florida on Monday, October 22, 2018.
Before Biden took the stage, Gillum fired up the audience with the kind of hopeful message that former President Barack Obama used to win the state in 2008 and 2012. He told the college students in the audience: ""I want you to follow your dreams.""
""I want to be the kind of state where you don't have to be on the first plane out of here,"" said Gillum, fresh off Sunday night's debate with DeSantis. ""I want you to be able to choose to build your life right here in the state of Florida.""
It's a message that resonated with Acree Trivett, a 21-year-old USF student from Daytona Beach. Trivett, a LGBTQ woman, said she has often considered leaving the state after graduating because of its conservative record on gay issues.
""I want to live in the state I was born in,"" she said. ""I don't always know if I can do that.""
There is a strong sense among Democrats that Gillum has brought an excitement to the ticket that will lure voters who traditionally skip mid-term elections. Polls have consistently shown him slightly ahead of DeSantis and often outperforming Nelson, who is in a tight race against Scott.
OCTAVIO JONES | TimesA packed gymnasium watches Florida Gubernatorial Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum give his speech during the Florida Democratic Party rally held at the University of South Florida in Tampa, Florida on Monday, October 22, 2018.
Monday's rally, while celebrating the entire ticket, certainly had the flair of a Gillum event. Gillum signs easily outnumberd those for Nelson. Nelson, 76, is the more senior official, but he introduced Gillum, 39. Audience members strained and held up phones to capture Gillum's speech on video.
And there was a noticeable difference in how the lineup of Democratic speakers talked about Gillum versus Nelson.
""I have seen excitement before, but let me tell you, this man is on fire,"" House Minority Leader Janet Cruz said of Gillum. ""This man is going to change Florida forever.""
Whether that translates into turnout is still to be determined. Republicans have built up a substantial lead in voting by mail so far, with more than 411,000 GOP voters returning their ballots compared to about 359,000 Democrats, 161,000 independent voters and 5,000 who belong to minor parties.
Early voting began Monday in 31 of the state's 67 counties. They included Pinellas, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade and Broward, and eight of the state's 10 most populous counties. Early voting will be underway in all 67 counties by Saturday, Oct. 27.
Most counties had not yet reported their first-day early voting totals early Monday night. But election web sites reported no long lines at voting locations. Early voting has traditionally been more popular with Democrats than Republicans.
Scott's campaign poked fun at Nelson's slot as a warm up-act for Gillum despite being atop the ticket.

""In the closing weeks of this campaign, liberal Andrew Gillum is calling in the cavalry of liberal Washington politicians to prop up his campaign,"" Scott spokesman Chris Hartline said. ""Oh, and Bill Nelson was there too.""
Biden acknowledged Gillum presented a unique opportunity for Florida voters to elect the state's first black governor.
It was an opportunity he said he never thought possible until he was sworn in alongside Obama.
""Don't tell me that things cant change. Don't tell me that won't happen,"" Biden said. ""It's time. It's time. It's time.""

","The White House last year championed a sweeping revision of the nation’s tax laws that expanded many of the benefits enjoyed by real estate investors, allowing them to reap even larger deductions.
“The Trump administration was in a position to clean up the tax code and promised to get rid of some of the complexity that certain taxpayers use to their advantage,” said Victor Fleischer, a tax law professor at the University of California, Irvine. “Instead, they doubled down on those provisions, particularly the ones they have familiarity with to benefit themselves.”
The documents, which The Times reviewed in their entirety, were created with Mr. Kushner’s cooperation as part of a review of his finances by an institution that was considering lending him money. Totaling more than 40 pages, they describe his business dealings, earnings, expenses and borrowing from 2009 to 2016. They contain information that was taken from Mr. Kushner’s federal tax filings, as well as other data provided by his advisers. The documents, mostly created last year, were shared with The Times by a person who has had financial dealings with Mr. Kushner and his family.
Thirteen tax accountants and lawyers, including J. Richard Harvey Jr., a tax official in the Reagan, George W. Bush and Obama administrations, reviewed the documents for The Times. Mr. Harvey said that, assuming the documents accurately reflect information from his tax returns, Mr. Kushner appeared to have paid little or no federal income taxes during at least five of the past eight years. The other experts agreed and said Mr. Kushner probably didn’t pay much in the three other years, either.
Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Mr. Kushner’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said he would not respond to assumptions derived from documents that provide an incomplete picture and were “obtained in violation of the law and standard business confidentiality agreements. However, always following the advice of numerous attorneys and accountants, Mr. Kushner properly filed and paid all taxes due under the law and regulations.”
Mr. Mirijanian added that, with regard to the tax legislation, Mr. Kushner “has avoided work that would pose any conflict of interest.”
Representatives of the White House and Mr. Kushner’s firm, Kushner Companies, didn’t respond to requests for comment."

","The FBI has described the Proud Boys as an “extremist group with ties to white nationalism” in a recent document produced by Washington State sheriffs.
Erin Willey, an ex-deputy who was fired in July after photos surfaced online of her donning a “Proud Boys Girls” sweatshirt was being investigated by the Clark county sheriff's department and the document was part of that investigation.
“The FBI categorises the Proud Boys as an extremist group with ties to white nationalism,” an executive summary of the report read. “The Proud Boy Girls ae believed to be ab affiliate group of women who openly support the ideology of the Proud Boys. The FBI Seattle office is unaware of how many female members are active in the Pacific Northwest.”
The summary continued, “Proud Boys members have contributed to the recent escalation of violence at political rallies held on college campuses, and in cities like Charlottesville, Virginia, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington.”
Michael McCabe, a commander at the Clark County Sheriff’s Office who authored the report, confirmed in an interview with The Guardian on Monday that the FBI had confirmed it classified Proud Boys as an extremist group during a briefing held on 2 August in the county’s western precinct.
The Southern Poverty Law Centre has also labelled the all-male Proud Boys a hate group, but the Proud Boys reject that classification and describe themselves as “Western chauvinists who refuse to apologise for creating the modern world.”
Members of the group brawled with anti-fascist protesters following a speech by its founder Gavin McInnes at a Manhattan Republican club last month, resulting in arrests of both Proud Boys’ members and anti-fascists.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, criticised the statewide Republican Party for inviting Mr McInnes.
The group sent his offices a package containing an informational brochure about Proud Boys that was initially believed to be part of the suspicious packages containing explosives sent to prominent Democrats and CNN, though it was eventually determined not to be linked.
The group was banned last month from Facebook and Instagram because of policies against hate groups, the company announced, saying in a statement, “Our team continues to study trends in organized hate and hate speech and works with partners to better understand hate organisations as they evolve.”
The loss of the platforms will likely hurt the Proud Boys’ ability to recruit. The Southern Poverty Law Centre reported in August that regional Proud Boys chapters were vetting new members through private Facebook chatrooms.

The Clark County briefing appeared to be the first time on public record the FBI had acknowledged Proud Boys as an extremist group, after activists and civil rights groups pushed for the classification for months.
During that meeting, FBI officials reportedly discussed how to tracks hate and extremist groups, adding they “have been warning [local law enforcement] for a while” about the group, “not just in Washington but around the nation.”"

","Twitter permanently banned President Donald Trump on Friday, days after a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol leaving five dead.
“After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” Twitter said in a statement Friday.
After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.https://t.co/CBpE1I6j8Y — Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) January 8, 2021
The ban comes after the president incited a mob that broke into the US Capitol building, disrupting Congress’ certification of Joe Biden as the President Elect. Twitter initially put a 12-hour ban on Trump’s account for “repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy” after he posted messages repeating lies that the election was stolen.
At the time, Twitter said Trump would be banned permanently if he continued to violate its rules, including those around civic integrity or violent threats. Twitter said in a statement Friday that two new tweets posted since Trump’s initial suspension violated the platform’s rules, prompting the permanent suspension.
“Due to the ongoing tensions in the United States, and an uptick in the global conversation in regards to the people who violently stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, these two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks,” Twitter said in its Friday blog.
Twitter decided the new tweets were “highly likely to encourage and inspire people to replicate the criminal acts” at the Capitol, and shared its reasoning in five parts:
President Trump’s statement that he will not be attending the Inauguration is being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate and is seen as him disavowing his previous claim made via two Tweets (1, 2) by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Dan Scavino, that there would be an “orderly transition” on January 20th. The second Tweet may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a “safe” target, as he will not be attending. The use of the words “American Patriots” to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol. The mention of his supporters having a “GIANT VOICE long into the future” and that “They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!” is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an “orderly transition” and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election. Plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021.
Twitter declined to comment on other Trump-related accounts like @POTUS when questioned by The Verge. If Trump attempted to circumvent this ban by using a separate account, that account would be permanently suspended “at first detection,” according to Twitter. If a government account, like @POTUS, was used to evade @realDonaldTrump’s ban, Twitter said that it would try to limit the account’s use but would not suspend it unless it was necessary to curb real-world violence.
Earlier Friday, more than 300 Twitter employees signed onto an internal petition calling for Trump to be permanently banned following the January 6th Capitol riots.
“We must examine Twitter’s complicity in what President-Elect Biden has rightly termed insurrection. Those acts jeopardize the wellbeing of the United States, our company, and our employees,” the employees wrote in the letter.
On Thursday, Facebook put an “indefinite” ban on Trump that it said would last at least through Inauguration Day. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the risks “are simply too great” to allow Trump continued access after he used the platform to “incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government.”
The suspension has been a long time coming. For years, Twitter has faced pressure to remove Trump from its platform due to the large megaphone it’s offered him to spread hateful language and lies. The company justified his continued presence on the platform as being in the public interest.

","U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, leads his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke by 9 percentage points among likely voters, according to a new poll from Quinnipiac University.
Released Tuesday, the survey found Cruz with 54 percent support and O'Rourke, an El Paso congressman, with 45 percent. Only 1 percent of those polled were undecided.
""The Texas U.S. Senate race between Sen. Ted Cruz and Congressman Beto O'Rourke, and Democratic hopes for an upset win there, have boosted talk of a Senate takeover,"" Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a news release. ""These numbers may calm that talk.""
It's the first time Quinnipiac has released a likely voter survey in the Senate race. Quinnipiac previously polled registered voters three times, finding Cruz ahead by 6 points in August, 11 in May and 3 in April.
Quinnipiac also surveyed the governor's race in the most recent poll and continued to find a much less competitive contest, with Republican Gov. Greg Abbott leading Democratic opponent Lupe Valdez by 19 points.
In the Senate race, Quinnipiac found Cruz has a higher favorability rating than O'Rourke does. Fifty-two percent of likely voters said they like Cruz to 43 percent who said they do not, while the split was a more divided 43-42 for O'Rourke.
Quinnipiac also asked likely voters about President Donald Trump — and they were evenly split, with 49 percent approving of the job he is doing and 49 percent disapproving. Trump is set to visit the state next month to rally for Cruz.
The latest Quinnipiac survey was conducted from Sept. 11 to Sept. 17 and reached 807 likely voters using live interviews on landlines and cell phones. The margin of error was plus or minus 4.1 percentage points."

On January 20, 2017, Donald Trump stood on the steps of the Capitol, raised his right hand, and solemnly swore to faithfully execute the office of president of the United States and, to the best of his ability, to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. He has not kept that promise. To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app. Instead, he has mounted a concerted challenge to the separation of powers, to the rule of law, and to the civil liberties enshrined in our founding documents. He has purposefully inflamed America’s divisions. He has set himself against the American idea, the principle that all of us—of every race, gender, and creed—are created equal. This is not a partisan judgment. Many of the president’s fiercest critics have emerged from within his own party. Even officials and observers who support his policies are appalled by his pronouncements, and those who have the most firsthand experience of governance are also the most alarmed by how Trump is governing.
Read the editor's note “The damage inflicted by President Trump’s naïveté, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate,” the late senator and former Republican presidential nominee John McCain lamented last summer. “The president has not risen to the mantle of the office,” the GOP’s other recent nominee, the former governor and now senator Mitt Romney, wrote in January. The oath of office is a president’s promise to subordinate his private desires to the public interest, to serve the nation as a whole rather than any faction within it. Trump displays no evidence that he understands these obligations. To the contrary, he has routinely privileged his self-interest above the responsibilities of the presidency. He has failed to disclose or divest himself from his extensive financial interests, instead using the platform of the presidency to promote them. This has encouraged a wide array of actors, domestic and foreign, to seek to influence his decisions by funneling cash to properties such as Mar-a-Lago (the “Winter White House,” as Trump has branded it) and his hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Courts are now considering whether some of those payments violate the Constitution. More troubling still, Trump has demanded that public officials put their loyalty to him ahead of their duty to the public. On his first full day in office, he ordered his press secretary to lie about the size of his inaugural crowd. He never forgave his first attorney general for failing to shut down investigations into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, and ultimately forced his resignation. “I need loyalty. I expect loyalty,” Trump told his first FBI director, and then fired him when he refused to pledge it.
Trump has evinced little respect for the rule of law, attempting to have the Department of Justice launch criminal probes into his critics and political adversaries. He has repeatedly attacked both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Counsel Robert Mueller. His efforts to mislead, impede, and shut down Mueller’s investigation have now led the special counsel to consider whether the president obstructed justice. As for the liberties guaranteed by the Constitution, Trump has repeatedly trampled upon them. He pledged to ban entry to the United States on the basis of religion, and did his best to follow through. He has attacked the press as the “enemy of the people” and barred critical outlets and reporters from attending his events. He has assailed black protesters. He has called for his critics in private industry to be fired from their jobs. He has falsely alleged that America’s electoral system is subject to massive fraud, impugning election results with which he disagrees as irredeemably tainted. Elected officials of both parties have repeatedly condemned such statements, which has only spurred the president to repeat them. These actions are, in sum, an attack on the very foundations of America’s constitutional democracy. 50 moments that define Trump’s presidency The electorate passes judgment on its presidents and their shortcomings every four years. But the Framers were concerned that a president could abuse his authority in ways that would undermine the democratic process and that could not wait to be addressed. So they created a mechanism for considering whether a president is subverting the rule of law or pursuing his own self-interest at the expense of the general welfare—in short, whether his continued tenure in office poses a threat to the republic. This mechanism is impeachment.
Trump’s actions during his first two years in office clearly meet, and exceed, the criteria to trigger this fail-safe. But the United States has grown wary of impeachment. The history of its application is widely misunderstood, leading Americans to mistake it for a dangerous threat to the constitutional order. That is precisely backwards. It is absurd to suggest that the Constitution would delineate a mechanism too potent to ever actually be employed. Impeachment, in fact, is a vital protection against the dangers a president like Trump poses. And, crucially, many of its benefits—to the political health of the country, to the stability of the constitutional system—accrue irrespective of its ultimate result. Impeachment is a process, not an outcome, a rule-bound procedure for investigating a president, considering evidence, formulating charges, and deciding whether to continue on to trial. The fight over whether Trump should be removed from office is already raging, and distorting everything it touches. Activists are radicalizing in opposition to a president they regard as dangerous. Within the government, unelected bureaucrats who believe the president is acting unlawfully are disregarding his orders, or working to subvert his agenda. By denying the debate its proper outlet, Congress has succeeded only in intensifying its pressures. And by declining to tackle the question head-on, it has deprived itself of its primary means of reining in the chief executive.
With a newly seated Democratic majority, the House of Representatives can no longer dodge its constitutional duty. It must immediately open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump, and bring the debate out of the court of public opinion and into Congress, where it belongs. Democrats picked up 40 seats in the House of Representatives in the 2018 elections. Despite this clear rebuke of Trump—and despite all that is publicly known about his offenses—party elders remain reluctant to impeach him. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, has argued that it’s too early to talk about impeachment. Many Democrats avoided discussing the idea on the campaign trail, preferring to focus on health care. When, on the first day of the 116th Congress, a freshman representative declared her intent to impeach Trump and punctuated her comments with an obscenity, she was chastised by members of the old guard—not just for how she raised the issue, but for raising it at all. In no small part, this trepidation is due to the fact that the last effort to remove an American president from office ended in political fiasco. When the House impeached Bill Clinton, in 1998, his popularity soared; in the Senate, even some Republicans voted against convicting him of the charges. Pelosi and her antediluvian leadership team served in Congress during those fights two decades ago, and they seem determined not to repeat their rivals’ mistakes. Polling has shown significant support for impeachment over the course of Trump’s tenure, but the most favorable polls still indicate that it lacks majority support. To move against Trump now, Democrats seem to believe, would only strengthen the president’s hand. Better to wait for public opinion to turn decisively against him and then use impeachment to ratify that view. This is the received wisdom on impeachment, the overlearned lesson of the Clinton years: House Republicans got out ahead of public opinion, and turned a president beset by scandal into a sympathetic figure.
Instead, Democrats intend to be a thorn in Trump’s side. House committees will conduct hearings into a wide range of issues, calling administration officials to testify under oath. They will issue subpoenas and demand documents, emails, and other information. The chair of the Ways and Means Committee has the power to request Trump’s elusive tax returns from the IRS and, with the House’s approval, make them public. Other institutions are already acting as brakes on the Trump presidency. To the president’s vocal frustration, federal judges have repeatedly enjoined his executive orders. Robert Mueller’s investigation has brought convictions of, or plea deals from, key figures in his campaign as well as his administration. Some Democrats are clearly hoping that if they stall for long enough, Mueller will deliver them from Trump, obviating the need to act themselves. But Congress can’t outsource its responsibilities to federal prosecutors. No one knows when Mueller’s report will arrive, what form it will take, or what it will say. Even if Mueller alleges criminal misconduct on the part of the president, under Justice Department guidelines, a sitting president cannot be indicted. Nor will the host of congressional hearings fulfill that branch’s obligations. The view they will offer of his conduct will be both limited and scattershot, focused on discrete acts. Only by authorizing a dedicated impeachment inquiry can the House begin to assemble disparate allegations into a coherent picture, forcing lawmakers to consider both whether specific charges are true and whether the president’s abuses of his power justify his removal. Trump’s bipartisan critics are not merely arguing that he has dishonored the presidency. The most serious charge is that he is attacking the bedrock of American democracy. Waiting also presents dangers. With every passing day, Trump further undermines our national commitment to America’s ideals. And impeachment is a long process. Typically, the House first votes to open an investigation—the hearings would likely take months—then votes again to present charges to the Senate. By delaying the start of the process, in the hope that even clearer evidence will be produced by Mueller or some other source, lawmakers are delaying its eventual conclusion. Better to forge ahead, weighing what is already known and incorporating additional material as it becomes available.
Critics of impeachment insist that it would diminish the presidency, creating an executive who serves at the sufferance of Congress. But defenders of executive prerogatives should be the first to recognize that the presidency has more to gain than to lose from Trump’s impeachment. After a century in which the office accumulated awesome power, Trump has done more to weaken executive authority than any recent president. The judiciary now regards Trump’s orders with a jaundiced eye, creating precedents that will constrain his successors. His own political appointees boast to reporters, or brag in anonymous op-eds, that they routinely work to counter his policies. Congress is contemplating actions on trade and defense that will hem in the president. His opponents repeatedly aim at the man but hit the office. Democrats’ fear—that impeachment will backfire on them—is likewise unfounded. The mistake Republicans made in impeaching Bill Clinton wasn’t a matter of timing. They identified real and troubling misconduct—then applied the wrong remedy to fix it. Clinton’s acts disgraced the presidency, and his lies under oath and efforts to obstruct the investigation may well have been crimes. The question that determines whether an act is impeachable, though, is whether it endangers American democracy. As a House Judiciary Committee staff report put it in 1974, in the midst of the Watergate investigation: “The purpose of impeachment is not personal punishment; its function is primarily to maintain constitutional government.” Impeachable offenses, it found, included “undermining the integrity of office, disregard of constitutional duties and oath of office, arrogation of power, abuse of the governmental process, adverse impact on the system of government.”
Trump’s bipartisan critics are not merely arguing that he has lied or dishonored the presidency. The most serious allegations against him ultimately rest on the charge that he is attacking the bedrock of American democracy. That is the situation impeachment was devised to address. Video: It’s Time to Impeach Trump After the House impeaches a president, the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate to remove him from office. Opponents of impeachment point out that, despite the greater severity of the prospective charges against Trump, there is little reason to believe the Senate is more likely to remove him than it was to remove Clinton. Indeed, the Senate’s Republican majority has shown little will to break with the president—though that may change. The process of impeachment itself is likely to shift public opinion, both by highlighting what’s already known and by bringing new evidence to light. If Trump’s support among Republican voters erodes, his support in the Senate may do the same. One lesson of Richard Nixon’s impeachment is that when legislators conclude a presidency is doomed, they can switch allegiances in the blink of an eye.
But this sort of vote-counting, in any case, misunderstands the point of impeachment. The question of whether impeachment is justified should not be confused with the question of whether it is likely to succeed in removing a president from office. The country will benefit greatly regardless of how the Senate ultimately votes. Even if the impeachment of Donald Trump fails to produce a conviction in the Senate, it can safeguard the constitutional order from a president who seeks to undermine it. The protections of the process alone are formidable. They come in five distinct forms. The first is that once an impeachment inquiry begins, the president loses control of the public conversation. Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton each discovered this, much to their chagrin. Johnson, the irascible Tennessee Democrat who succeeded to the presidency in 1865 upon the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, quickly found himself at odds with the Republican Congress. He shattered precedents by delivering a series of inflammatory addresses that dominated the headlines and forced his opponents into a reactive posture. The launching of impeachment inquiries changed that. Day after day, Congress held hearings. Day after day, newspapers splashed the proceedings across their front pages. Instead of focusing on Johnson’s fearmongering, the press turned its attention to the president’s missteps, to the infighting within his administration, and to all the things that congressional investigators believed he had done wrong.
It isn’t just the coverage that changes. When presidents face the prospect of impeachment, they tend to discover a previously unsuspected capacity for restraint and compromise, at least in public. They know that their words can be used against them, so they fume in private. Johnson’s calls for the hanging of his political opponents yielded quickly to promises to defer to their judgment on the key questions of the day. Nixon raged to his aides, but tried to show a different face to the country. “Dignity, command, faith, head high, no fear, build a new spirit,” he told himself. Clinton sent bare-knuckled proxies to the television-news shows, but he and his staff chose their own words carefully. Trump is easily the most pugilistic president since Johnson; he’s never going to behave with decorous restraint. But if impeachment proceedings begin, his staff will surely redouble its efforts to curtail his tweeting, his lawyers will counsel silence, and his allies on Capitol Hill will beg for whatever civility he can muster. His ability to sidestep scandal by changing the subject—perhaps his greatest political skill—will diminish. As Trump fights for his political survival, that struggle will overwhelm other concerns. This is the second benefit of impeachment: It paralyzes a wayward president’s ability to advance the undemocratic elements of his agenda. Some of Trump’s policies are popular, and others are widely reviled. Some of his challenges to settled orthodoxies were long overdue, and others have proved ill-advised. These are ordinary features of our politics and are best dealt with through ordinary electoral processes. It is, rather, the extraordinary elements of Trump’s presidency that merit the use of impeachment to forestall their success: his subversion of the rule of law, attacks on constitutional liberties, and advancement of his own interests at the public’s expense.
The Mueller probe as well as hearings convened by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have already hobbled the Trump administration to some degree. It will face even more scrutiny from a Democratic House. White House aides will have to hire personal lawyers; senior officials will spend their afternoons preparing testimony. But impeachment would raise the scrutiny to an entirely different level. In part, this is because of the enormous amount of attention impeachment proceedings garner. But mostly, the scrutiny stems from the stakes of the process. The most a president generally has to fear from congressional hearings is embarrassment; there is always an aide to take the fall. Impeachment puts his own job on the line, and demands every hour of his day. The rarest commodity in any White House is time, that of the president and his top advisers. When it’s spent watching live hearings or meeting with lawyers, the administration’s agenda suffers. This is the irony of congressional leaders’ counseling patience, urging members to simply wait Trump out and use the levers of legislative power instead of moving ahead with impeachment. There may be no more effective way to run out the clock on an administration than to tie it up with impeachment hearings.
But the advantages of impeachment are not merely tactical. The third benefit is its utility as a tool of discovery and discernment. At the moment, it is often hard to tell the difference between wild-eyed conspiracy theories and straight narrations of the day’s news. Some of what is alleged about Trump is plainly false; much of it might be true, but lacks supporting evidence; and many of the best-documented claims are quickly forgotten, lost in the din of fresh allegations. This is what passes for due process in the court of public opinion.
The problem is not new. When Congress first opened the Johnson impeachment hearings, for instance, the committee spent two months chasing rumor and innuendo. It heard allegations that Johnson had sent a secret letter to former Confederate President Jefferson Davis; that he had associated with a “disreputable woman” and, through her, sold pardons; that he had transferred ownership of confiscated railroads as political favors; even that he had conspired with John Wilkes Booth to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. The congressman who made that last claim was forced to admit to the committee pursuing impeachment that what he possessed “was not that kind of evidence which would satisfy the great mass of men”—he had simply based the accusation on his belief that every vice president who succeeds to the highest office murders his predecessor. There was public value, though, in these investigations. The charges had already been leveled; they were circulating and shaping public opinion. Spread by a highly polarized, partisan press, they could not be dispelled or disproved. But once Congress initiated the process of impeachment, the charges had to be substantiated. And that meant taking them from the realm of rhetoric into the province of fact. Many of the claims against Johnson failed to survive the journey. Those that did eventually helped form the basis for his impeachment. Separating them out was crucial.
The process of impeachment can also surface evidence. The House Judiciary Committee began its impeachment hearings against Nixon in October 1973, well before the president’s complicity in the Watergate cover-up was clear. In April 1974, as part of those hearings, the Judiciary Committee subpoenaed 42 White House tapes. In response, Nixon released transcripts of the tapes that were so obviously expurgated that a district judge approved a subpoena from the special prosecutor for the tapes themselves. That demand, in turn, eventually produced the so-called smoking-gun tape, a recording of Nixon authorizing the CIA to shut down the FBI’s investigation into Watergate. The evidence that drove Nixon from office thus emerged as a consequence of the impeachment hearings; it did not spark them. The only way for the House to find out what Trump has actually done, and whether his conduct warrants removal, is to start asking. That is not to say that impeachment hearings against Trump would be sober and orderly. The Clinton hearings were something of a circus, and the past two years on Capitol Hill suggest that any Trump hearings will be far worse. The president’s stalwart defenders are already attacking the integrity of potential witnesses and airing their own conspiracy theories; an attempt to smear Mueller with sexual-misconduct claims collapsed spectacularly in October. His accusers, meanwhile, hurl epithets and invective. In Congress, Trump’s most committed detractors might be tempted to follow the bad example of the Clinton impeachment, when, instead of conducting extensive hearings to weigh potential charges, House Republicans short-circuited the process—taking the independent counsel’s conclusions, rushing them to the floor, and voting to impeach in a lame-duck session. Trump’s opponents need to put their faith in the process, empowering a committee to consider specific charges, weigh the available evidence, and decide whether to proceed.
Hosting that debate in Congress yields a fourth benefit: defusing the potential for an explosion of political violence. This is a rationale for impeachment first offered at the Constitutional Convention, in 1787. “What was the practice before this in cases where the chief Magistrate rendered himself obnoxious?” Benjamin Franklin asked his fellow delegates. “Why, recourse was had to assassination in wch. he was not only deprived of his life but of the opportunity of vindicating his character.” A system without a mechanism for removing the chief executive, he argued, offered an invitation to violence. Just as the courts took the impulse toward vigilante justice and safely channeled it into the protections of the legal system, impeachment took the impulse toward political violence and safely channeled it into Congress. Nixon’s presidency was marked by an upsurge in political terrorism. In just its first 16 months, 4,330 bombings claimed 43 lives. As the Vietnam War wound down and the militant left began to lose its salience, it made opposition to the president its new rallying cry. “Impeach Nixon and jail him for his major crimes,” the Weather Underground demanded in its manifesto, Prairie Fire, in July 1974. “Nixon merits the people’s justice.” But that seemingly radical demand, intended to expose the inadequacy of the regular constitutional order, ironically proved the opposite point. By the end of the month, the House Judiciary Committee had approved three articles of impeachment; in early August, Nixon resigned. The ship of state, it turned out, had the capacity to right itself. The Weather Underground continued its slide into irrelevance, and political violence eventually receded.
The current moment is different, of course. Today, the left is again radicalizing, but the overwhelming majority of political violence is committed by the far right, albeit on a considerably smaller scale than in the Nixon era. Trump himself has warned that “the people would revolt” if he were impeached, a warning that echoes earlier eras. When Congress debated impeachment in 1868, some likewise predicted that it would provoke Andrew Johnson’s most ardent supporters to violence. “We are evidently on the eve of a revolution that may, should an appeal be taken to arms, be more bloody than that inaugurated by the firing on Fort Sumter,” warned The Boston Post. The predictions were wrong then, as Trump’s are likely wrong now. The public understood that once the impeachment process began, the real action would take place in Congress, and not in the streets. Johnson knew that inciting his supporters to violence would erode congressional support just when he needed it most. That seems the most probable outcome today as well. If impeached, Trump would lose the luxury of venting his resentments before friendly crowds, stirring their anger. His audience, by political necessity, would become a few dozen senators in Washington. And what if the Senate does not convict Trump? The fifth benefit of impeachment is that, even when it fails to remove a president, it severely damages his political prospects. Johnson, abandoned by Republicans and rejected by Democrats, did not run for a second term. Nixon resigned, and Gerald Ford, his successor, lost his bid for reelection. Clinton weathered the process and finished out his second term, but despite his personal popularity, he left an electorate hungering for change. “Many, including Al Gore, think that the impeachment cost Gore the election,” Paul Rosenzweig, a former senior member of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr’s team, told me. “So it has consequences and resonates outside the narrow four corners of impeachment.” If Congress were to impeach Trump, whatever short-term surge he might enjoy as supporters rallied to his defense, his long-term political fate would likely be sealed.
In these five ways—shifting the public’s attention to the president’s debilities, tipping the balance of power away from him, skimming off the froth of conspiratorial thinking, moving the fight to a rule-bound forum, and dealing lasting damage to his political prospects—the impeachment process has succeeded in the past. In fact, it’s the very efficacy of these past efforts that should give Congress pause; it’s a process that should be triggered only when a president’s betrayal of his basic duties requires it. But Trump’s conduct clearly meets that threshold. The only question is whether Congress will act. Here is how impeachment would work in practice. The Constitution lays out the process clearly, and two centuries of precedent will guide Congress in its work. The House possesses the sole power of impeachment—a procedure analogous to an indictment. Traditionally, this has meant tapping a committee to summon witnesses, subpoena documents, hold hearings, and consider the evidence. The committee can then propose specific articles of impeachment to the full House. If a simple majority approves the charges, they are forwarded to the Senate. The chief justice of the United States presides over the trial; members of the House are designated to act as “managers,” or prosecuting attorneys. If two-thirds of the senators who are present vote to convict, the president is removed from office; if the vote falls short, he is not.
Although the process is fairly clear, the Founders left us only vague instructions about when to implement it. The Constitution offers a short, cryptic list of the offenses that merit the impeachment and removal of federal officials: “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” The first two items are comparatively straightforward. The Constitution elsewhere specifies that treason against the United States consists “only in levying War” against the country or in giving the country’s enemies “Aid and Comfort.” As proof, it requires either the testimony of two witnesses or confession in open court. Despite the appalling looseness with which the charge of treason has been bandied about by members of Congress past and present, no federal official—much less a president—has ever been impeached for it. (Even the darkest theories of Trump’s alleged collusion with Russia seem unlikely to meet the Constitution’s strict definition of that crime.) Bribery, similarly, has been alleged only once, and against a judge, not a president. It is the third item on the list—“high crimes and misdemeanors”—on which all presidential impeachments have hinged. If the House begins impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump, the charges will depend on this clause, but Congress will first need to decide what it means. At the Constitutional Convention, an early draft included “treason, bribery, and corruption,” but it was shorn of that last item by the time it arrived on the floor. George Mason, of Virginia, spoke up. “Why is the provision restrained to Treason & bribery only?” he asked, according to James Madison’s notes. “Treason as defined in the Constitution will not reach many great and dangerous offences … Attempts to subvert the Constitution may not be Treason as above defined.” Mason moved to add “or maladministration.”
Madison, though, objected that “so vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the Senate.” Gouverneur Morris further argued that “an election of every four years will prevent maladministration.” Mere incompetence or policy disputes were best dealt with by voters. But that still left Mason’s original concern, for the “many great and dangerous offences” not covered by treason or bribery. Instead of “maladministration,” he suggested, why not substitute “other high crimes & misdemeanors (agst. the State)”? The motion carried. Constitutional lawyers have been arguing about what counts as a “high crime” or “misdemeanor” ever since. The phrase itself was borrowed from English common law, although there is no reason to suppose Mason and his colleagues were deeply familiar with its uses in that context. The Nixon impeachment spurred Charles L. Black, a Yale law professor, to write Impeachment: A Handbook, a slender volume that remains a defining work on the question. Black makes two key points. First, he notes that as a matter of logic as well as context and precedent, not every violation of a criminal statute amounts to a “high crime” or “misdemeanor.” To apply his reasoning, some crimes—say, violating 40 U.S.C. §8103(b)(2) by willfully injuring a shrub on federal property in Washington, D.C.—cannot possibly be impeachable offenses. Conversely, a president may violate his oath of office without violating the letter of the law. A president could, for example, harness the enforcement powers of the federal government to systematically persecute his political opponents, or he could grossly neglect the duties of his office. That sort of conduct, in Black’s view, is impeachable even when it is not actually criminal.
His second point rests upon the principle of eiusdem generis—literally, “of the same kind.” As the last item in a list of three impeachable offenses, surely “high crimes and misdemeanors” shares some essential features with the first two. Black suggests that treason and bribery have in common three essential features: They are extremely serious, they stand to corrupt and subvert government and the political process, and they are self-evidently wrong to any person with a shred of honor. These, he argues, are features that a “high crime” or “misdemeanor” ought to share. Black’s views on these points are not uncontested. Nixon’s attorneys argued that impeachment did require a crime. In 1974, before Black published his book, a report from the Justice Department split the difference, concluding that “there are persuasive grounds for arguing both the narrow view that a violation of criminal law is required and the broader view that certain non-criminal ‘political offenses’ may justify impeachment.” John Doar, the attorney hired by the House Judiciary Committee to oversee the Nixon investigation, handed off the question of what constituted an impeachable offense to two young staffers: Bill Weld and Hillary Rodham. They determined that the answers they were seeking were to be found not in old case law, but in the public debates that raged around past impeachment efforts. The memo Weld and Rodham helped produce drew on that context and sided with Black: “High crimes and misdemeanors” need not be crimes. In the end, Weld came to believe that impeachment is a political process, aimed at determining whether a president has fallen short of the duties of his office. But that doesn’t mean it’s arbitrary. In fact, the Nixon impeachment left Weld with a renewed faith in the American system of government: “The wheels may grind slowly,” he later reflected, “but they grind pretty well.”
Some Democrats have already seen enough from the Trump administration to conclude that it has met the criteria for impeachment. In July 2017, Representative Brad Sherman of California put forward an impeachment resolution; it garnered a single co-sponsor. The next month, though, brought the white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and Trump’s defense of the “very fine people on both sides.” The billionaire activist Tom Steyer launched a petition drive calling for impeachment. A second resolution was introduced in the House that November, this time by Tennessee’s Steve Cohen, who found 17 co-sponsors. By December 2017, when Representative Al Green of Texas forced consideration of a third resolution, 58 Democrats voted in favor of continuing debate, including Jim Clyburn, the House’s third-ranking Democrat. On the first day of the new Congress in January, Sherman reintroduced his resolution. These efforts are exercises in political messaging, not serious attempts to tackle the question of impeachment. They invert the process, offering lists of charges for the House to consider, rather than asking the House to consider what charges may be justified. The House should instead approve a resolution authorizing an impeachment inquiry and allocating the staff, funding, and other resources necessary to pursue it, as the resolution that initiated the proceedings against Richard Nixon did.
Still, the resolutions proposed so far offer a valuable glimpse at the issues House Democrats are likely to pursue in such an inquiry. Some have made a general case that Trump has done violence to American values—Green’s stated that Trump “has betrayed his trust as President … to the manifest injury of the people of the United States”—but others have claimed specific violations of statutes or constitutional provisions. Both types of allegations may turn out to be important. Despite the consensus of constitutional scholars that impeachable offenses need not be crimes, Congress has generally preferred to vote on articles that allege criminal acts. More than a third of representatives, and an outright majority of senators, hold law degrees; they think like lawyers. Democrats are thus focused on campaign-finance regulations, obstruction of justice, tax laws, money-laundering rules, proscriptions on bribing foreign officials, and the Constitution’s two emoluments clauses, which bar the president from accepting gifts from state or foreign governments. They have studiously avoided, however, the primary area of public fascination when it comes to Trump’s alleged misdeeds: whether the president or his campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 election. Lawmakers are clearly wary of bringing charges that could bear on Robert Mueller’s report, lest they interfere with an ongoing investigation that they hope will somehow force Trump from office. “It all depends on what we learn from hearings and from the Mueller investigation,” Representative Cohen told me. But the highly anticipated Mueller report is unlikely to provide the denouement lawmakers are seeking. Whether a president can be impeached for acts committed prior to assuming office is an unsettled question. As Trump himself never tires of pointing out, collusion with Russia is not itself a crime. And even if Mueller produces a singularly damning report, one presenting evidence that the president himself has committed criminal acts, he cannot indict the president—at least according to current Justice Department guidelines. Congress will have to decide what to do about it. Once the House authorizes an impeachment inquiry, the committee must distill the evidence of Trump’s alleged crimes into articles capable of garnering a majority vote in that chamber. But that’s just the first challenge. To remove Trump from office, the House managers will then have to persuade the Senate to vote to convict the president. When the articles of impeachment are filed with the Senate, where the president will be tried, each article will be considered and voted on individually. And then, suddenly, the members of the United States Senate will be forced to answer a question that many have long evaded: Is the president fit to continue in office? There will be no press aides to hide behind, no elevators into which they can duck. Some Democrats have already made their opinions clear. Others will have to decide whether to vote to remove a president backed by a majority of their constituents. For Republicans, the choice will be even harder. This is where the dual nature of impeachment as both a legal and a political process comes into sharpest focus. The Founders worried about electing a president who lacked character or a sense of honor, but Americans have long since lost the moral vocabulary to articulate such concerns explicitly, preferring to look instead for demonstrable violations of rules that illuminate underlying character flaws. It is Trump’s unfitness for office that necessitates impeachment; his attacks on American democracy are plainly evident, and should be sufficient. But some Republican senators may continue to dismiss the more sweeping claims against the president, particularly where no statutory crimes attach. And so the strength of the evidence supporting narrower charges such as obstruction of justice and campaign-finance violations may ultimately determine his fate. If the committee can substantiate these charges, it will place even the most reluctant senators in a bind. When the moment finally comes to cast their vote, and the world is watching, how many will acquit the president of things he has clearly done? The closest the Senate has ever come to removing a president was in 1868, after Andrew Johnson was impeached on 11 counts. Remembered today as a lamentable exercise in hyper-partisanship, in fact Johnson’s impeachment functioned as the Founders had intended, sparing the country from the further depredations of a president who had betrayed his most basic responsibilities. We need to recover the real story of Johnson’s impeachment, because it offers the best evidence that the current president, too, must be impeached. The case before the United States in 1868 bears striking similarities to the case before the country now—and no president in history more resembles the 45th than the 17th. “The president of the United States,” E. P. Whipple wrote in this magazine in 1866, “has so singular a combination of defects for the office of a constitutional magistrate, that he could have obtained the opportunity to misrule the nation only by a visitation of Providence. Insincere as well as stubborn, cunning as well as unreasonable, vain as well as ill-tempered, greedy of popularity as well as arbitrary in disposition, veering in his mind as well as fixed in his will, he unites in his character the seemingly opposite qualities of demagogue and autocrat.” Johnson, he continued, was “egotistic to the point of mental disease” and had become “the prey of intriguers and sycophants.” Whipple was among Johnson’s more verbose critics, but hardly the most scathing. A remarkable number of Americans looked at the president and saw a man grossly unfit for office. Johnson, a Democrat from a Civil War border state, had been tapped by Lincoln in 1864 to join him on a national-unity ticket. A fierce opponent of the slaveholding elite and a self-styled champion of the white yeomanry, Johnson spoke to voters skeptical of the Republican Party’s progressive agenda. He horrified much of the East Coast establishment, but his raw, even profane style appealed to many voters. The National Union Party, seeking the destruction of slavery and the Confederacy, swept to victory. No one ever thought Johnson would be president. Then, in 1865, Booth’s bullet put him in office. The end of the war exposed how different Johnson’s own agenda was from the policies favored by Lincoln. Johnson wanted to reintegrate the South into the Union as swiftly as possible, devoid of slavery but otherwise little changed. Most congressional Republicans, by contrast, wanted to seize the moment to build a new social order in the South, enshrining equality and protecting civil rights. Johnson sought to restore America as it had been, while the Republicans hoped to make it more perfect. The two visions were irreconcilable. As the feud deepened, each side pushed its commitments to their logical extremes. Congressional Republicans approved the Fourteenth Amendment, voted to enlarge the role of the Freedmen’s Bureau, and passed the Civil Rights Act. Taken together, these measures established the equality of Americans before the law and, for the first time, made its preservation a federal concern. They amounted to nothing less than a social revolution, a promise of an America that belonged to all Americans, not just to white men. From the archives: W. E. B. Du Bois on the Freedmen’s Bureau Johnson and his supporters found this intolerable. In federal efforts to establish racial equality, they saw antiwhite discrimination. Johnson vetoed the Civil Rights Act, insisting that “the distinction of race and color is by the bill made to operate in favor of the colored and against the white race.” For the first time in American history, Congress overrode a veto to pass a major piece of legislation. Three months later, he vetoed the renewal of the Freedmen’s Bureau Bill, complaining that its plan to distribute land to former slaves constituted “discrimination” that would establish a “favored class of citizens.” Congress again overrode his veto. That set up an unprecedented situation, as the president was asked to administer laws he had tried to block. Instead of the promised peace, the nation found itself gripped by an accelerating crisis.
The question facing Congress, and the public, was this: What do you do with a president whose every utterance and act seems to undermine the Constitution he is sworn to uphold? At first, Republicans pursued the standard mix of legislative remedies—holding hearings and passing bills designed to strip the president of certain powers. Many members of Johnson’s Cabinet worked with their congressional counterparts to constrain the president. Johnson began to see conspiracies around every corner. He moved to purge the bureaucracy of his opponents, denouncing the “blood-suckers and cormorants” who frustrated his desires. It was the campaign of white-nationalist terror that raged through the spring and summer of 1866 that persuaded many Republicans they could not allow Johnson to remain in office. In Tennessee, where Johnson had until the year before served as military governor, a white mob opposed to black equality rampaged through the streets of Memphis in May, slaughtering dozens of people as it went. July brought a second massacre, this one in New Orleans, where efforts to enfranchise black voters sparked a riot. A mob filled with police, firemen, armed youths, and Confederate veterans shot, stabbed, bludgeoned, and mutilated dozens, many of them black veterans of the Union Army. Johnson chose not to suppress the violence, using fear of disorder to build a constituency more loyal to him than to either party. Congress opened impeachment hearings. The process unfolded in fits and starts over the next year and a half, as Johnson’s congressional opponents searched vainly for some charge that could gain the support of a majority of the House. Then Johnson handed it to them by firing his secretary of war, defying a law passed, in part, to stop him from undermining Reconstruction. The House passed 11 articles of impeachment, forcing Johnson to stand trial before the Senate. But the effort fell short by a single vote. When Johnson’s supporters learned that he had been spared, they were ecstatic. In Milwaukee, they careened down the street in a wagon, shouting for Johnson and liberty, sharing a keg of beer. In Boston and in Hartford, Connecticut, they fired 100‑gun salutes; in Dearborn, Michigan, they settled for 19 guns and bonfires. “We have stood for the last few months upon the verge of a precipice, a dark abyss of anarchy yawning at our feet,” the Maryland Democrat Stevenson Archer said, sketching an alternative result whereby “dark-skinned fiends and white-faced, white-livered vampires might rule and riot on the little blood they could still suck out by fastening on helpless throats.” But the euphoria proved short-lived. The New York Times urged Johnson’s supporters to look at the bigger picture: “Congress has assumed control of the whole matter of reconstruction, and will assert and exercise it.” Any effort to wrest control back from the House and Senate was held in check by the specter of another impeachment, which haunted Johnson’s remaining months in office. The Democrats took up Johnson’s political cause; their convention theme in 1868 was “This Is a White Man’s Country; Let White Men Rule.” But when the politically damaged Johnson made a bid for the Democratic nomination—“Why should they not take me up?”—he was refused. Ulysses S. Grant won on the Republican ticket, and threw the full force of the Army behind the project of Reconstruction. Johnson went home to Tennessee. Congress must decide whether the greater risk lies in executing the Constitution, or in deferring to voters to do what it cannot muster the courage to do itself. If the goal of impeachment was to frustrate Johnson’s efforts to make America a white man’s country again, it was an unqualified success. Instead of being remembered as a triumph, however, in the years that followed, it was memorialized as a failure. Defending the impeachment on substantive grounds required believing that all people born in the United States—white and black alike—deserved the same civil liberties. And a decade later, America changed its mind about that, abandoning the project of Reconstruction and reneging on its promise of civil rights for African Americans. Johnson had said he was fighting to preserve a “white man’s government,” and for the next century, that’s what the country largely had. Robbed of its animating force, the bill of particulars against Johnson began to seem hollow, petty, and misguided. How could it have been proper to impeach a president for undermining the Constitution’s guarantee of equality, when the nation as a whole had subsequently done the same? The chorus of experts who now present Johnson’s impeachment as an exercise in raw partisanship are not learning from history but, rather, erasing it. Johnson used his office to deny the millions freed from bondage the equality that God had given them and that the Constitution guaranteed. To deny the justice of Johnson’s impeachment is to affirm the justice of his acts. If his impeachment was partisan, it was because one party had been formed to defend the freedom of man, and the other had not yet reconciled itself to that proposition.

Impeachment: An Argument
The Clinton Impeachment, as Told by the People Who Lived It
From the Archives: The Johnson Party, September 1866 The senators who voted against convicting Johnson insisted that they were standing on principle and upholding the Constitution. Yet some of the same lawmakers who expended so much effort defending the prerogatives of the presidency simultaneously turned a blind eye to the gross civil-rights violations that pervaded the South; their deep concern for constitutional niceties with respect to the president gave way to willful indifference when blacks were the ones who were systematically and violently deprived of their rights. It was a bitter irony: The impeachment proceedings were greeted with alarm by those who feared they would destroy the Constitution. In the end, though, it was the regular process of government that eventually ratified Jim Crow, the most outrageous abrogation of constitutional protections in the nation’s history. Impeachment drew the United States closer to living up to its ideals, if only fleetingly, by rallying the public against Johnson’s assault on the Constitution. Today, the United States once more confronts a president who seems to care for only some of the people he represents, who promises his supporters that he can roll back the tide of diversity, who challenges the rule of law, and who regards constitutional rights and liberties as disposable. Congress must again decide whether the greater risk lies in executing the Constitution as it was written, or in deferring to voters to do what it cannot muster the courage to do itself. The gravest danger facing the country is not a Congress that seeks to measure the president against his oath—it is a president who fails to measure up to that solemn promise. This article appears in the March 2019 print edition with the headline “The Case for Impeachment.”"

","It looks as if Congress will soon pass a much-needed economic relief (not stimulus) bill — something that will help distressed Americans get through the next few months, while we wait for widespread vaccination to set the stage for economic recovery. That’s good news, because something is better than nothing, even though what we know about the legislation says that it’s going to be deeply flawed.
But the way this debate has been playing out is ominous for the future. Even some of the good guys seem a bit confused about what they’re trying to do. And the bad guys — Mitch McConnell and company — are clearly doing some of the right things only under political duress, while giving every indication that they’ll systematically undermine the economy once President-elect Joe Biden takes office.
About good guys getting it wrong: Economic relief legislation is largely about providing individuals and families with a financial lifeline during the pandemic. But who should get that lifeline? Should it go to a majority of the population, like those $1,200 checks sent out in the spring? Or should the focus be on enhanced unemployment benefits for the millions of workers who, thanks to the pandemic, have no income at all?
According to The Washington Post, Senators Bernie Sanders and Joe Manchin had a heated argument about this issue on Wednesday during a conference call, with Sanders pushing for broad aid while Manchin argued that enhanced unemployment benefits were more crucial."

","You’ll be shocked to hear that the White House has already pronounced the FBI report entirely exonerating for Kavanaugh, claiming that it is now “fully confident” Kavanaugh will be confirmed.
But a lot of new reporting has now emerged that starkly illustrates just how much about the new allegations was not investigated by the FBI. It’s important to note that this probably was not a failing on the FBI’s part but rather was the result of restrictions the White House placed on the probe, a process that itself remains shrouded in disingenuous rhetorical games.
AD
AD
The New York Times reports that as part of the inquiry, the FBI interviewed nine people, and The Post reports that it could confirm interviews with only six people. It appears clear that the FBI did interview Mark Judge, who was named by Christine Blasey Ford as an accomplice in the alleged sexual attack; Patrick Smyth and Leland Keyser, who may have been present downstairs; Chris Garrett, who may have dated Ford at one point; and Tim Gaudette, whose house was the site of a July 1982 gathering noted on Kavanaugh’s calendar.
Here’s a list of the people who we know have not been interviewed:
We’ll have to wait to hear from individual senators to learn what the FBI findings, such as they are, tell us about the sexual assault allegations. But whatever that is to be, are the undecided senators — Republicans Jeff Flake, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, and Democrats Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp — really going to brush off all these new claims, and the restrictions the White House placed on the FBI, lightly?
AD
AD
Kavanaugh’s bad-faith defenders have tried to frame the question about Kavanaugh’s drinking as: Are you really saying his youthful excesses are disqualifying? True, many of those excesses are trivial. But that’s not the right question. Rather, it’s whether Kavanaugh has shown a level of candor in the present about all this stuff (never mind the angry partisanship and openly displayed contempt for the critical role that opposition lawmakers play in this process) that we expect in a Supreme Court justice.
Kavanaugh defenders who have addressed that question point out that he admitted to drinking “too many beers” at times and to doing things that now leave him “cringing.” But this doesn’t get Kavanaugh off that particular hook: All of this new information, on top of other things we’ve already learned, credibly indicate that he blatantly falsified multiple aspects of his conduct in a highly specific way. An admission of general cringeworthiness doesn’t mitigate that. Undecided senators need to decide whether Kavanaugh has really demonstrated the integrity — and respect for the vetting process — that this position, with all the influence it wields over American life, and all the judiciousness and deliberative qualities we expect from those on the high court, demands.
Hundreds of law professors have now added their names to a letter arguing that he has not. And then there’s the process itself. When Flake courageously insisted on a reopened FBI inquiry, he stated that this was necessary to prevent the country from tearing itself apart. The threshold for Flake, then, is that treating these allegations with a seriousness of purpose commensurate with the gravity that millions of Americans across the country accord to sexual assault — many of them being survivors themselves — is the necessary precondition for healing the country, and thus for getting his vote. In this, he was joined by Collins and Murkowski.
AD
AD
But given everything we’ve seen so far — and given what we now are learning — about this process, can any of these undecided senators really claim with a straight face that this standard has been met? If not, how can they vote for Kavanaugh, without betraying their own declared standard to be a lie?"

","The Trump Era does have one upside: people now feel comfortable saying the quiet parts out loud. You no longer have to decipher what they're really about—they'll just tell you straight-up. That's why it's a more and more common experience to wake up and see that one of the fabulously rich resentment-peddlers on the president's favorite news network spent the previous evening spouting unabashed white nationalism on-air. Usually, it's Tucker Carlson who pops up on Fox News to rail against ""demographic changes"" in America—that is, non-white people immigrating here. That kind of rhetoric has earned Carlson praise from Richard Spencer and David Duke.
But Laura Ingraham certainly gave Carlson a run for his money Wednesday night, unleashing a nakedly white nationalist rant that suggested ""the America we know and love"" has been destroyed by ""massive demographic changes"" due to both illegal and legal immigration:
This content is imported from Twitter. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.
Laura Ingraham: ""The America we know and love doesn't exist anymore. Massive demographic changes have been foisted on the American people, and they are changes that none of us ever voted for, and most of us don't like ... this is related to both illegal and legal immigration"" pic.twitter.com/s5G2qIY4W0 — Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) August 9, 2018
This is no longer a dogwhistle. Ingraham is saying outright that allowing non-white people to come here—and, down the line, threaten the majority power enjoyed by White America—is tantamount to destroying America. In this formulation, what defines the United States is its whiteness, or at least the idea that white people are at the center of American life. Which they are, for now. To Ingraham, America is not a daring experiment in self-government based on the principles of liberty, equality before the law, and self-determination, which anyone can be a part of if they work hard and buy into these values. White people got here first—ignore those pesky Native Americans!—so it's white people's turf.
Like the Trump administration, which has tried to cut even legal immigration by any means possible, Ingraham is no longer pantomiming about how illegal immigration is the problem. The problem for these folks is that Certain People are coming here, full stop. They want more people from Norway, or they don't want anyone coming at all. You can tell because Ingraham backed her soliloquy with footage of...people farming? That seems like a pretty traditional American activity. Ah, but everyone featured in the video playing as you say ""the America we know and love"" is gone...is Latino. And now you're showing people climbing a border fence.
Twitter
""None of us ever voted for"" this, Ingraham said, apparently pining for the time of the Chinese Exclusion Act. No one needs to vote in favor of new people coming to America. It is the story of America. This discussion used to center on how we can better enforce our immigration laws. Now it's about whether anyone should be allowed in at all.
Ingraham went on to highlight the case of one undocumented immigrant who committed child rape as part of an attack on Philadelphia as a sanctuary city. This is a classic ploy among propagandists—to highlight one horrific occurrence and present it as representative of an entire group. That is why the president, and Fox News, continually highlight MS-13 when discussing immigration, even though MS-13 makes up a tiny percentage of immigrants—and of the nation's gang members—and undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit crime than native citizens. (Meanwhile, ICE arrests of noncriminal immigrants have skyrocketed.) Oh, and the very basis for the current immigration crisis is bunk: illegal border crossings are at historic lows, a fraction of the level during the 1990s.
But none of that matters to the Fox News resentment hounds. They're railing against legal immigration now. A new study, picked up by Vox, indicates that reminding white people they are losing majority status—and power—due to changing demographics in America makes them more hostile to social safety net programs that benefit poor minorities. Fox News has known this for decades, and has sold white resentment as a primary product. After all, it serves a double purpose: give viewers what they want, and turn them towards policies favored by the corporate class that actually makes Republican Party policy.

But perhaps the most telling part of Ingraham's monologue last night came before the true white nationalist section. It came as she took on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic Socialist from New York who seems to drive right-wingers a special brand of insane. Surely it's a coincidence that it was Ocasio-Cortez, an increasingly powerful Puerto Rican star in Democratic politics, who launched Ingraham on this rant about the demographic destruction of America.
Anyway, the Fox host had this to say:
As if she knows all of America from her loft in Queens.
This really has it all. There's the ""loft"" description to suggest Ocasio-Cortez is living the lap of luxury, even though Queens is far from New York's wealthiest bureau. On the flip side, Ingraham is worth tens of millions of dollars, and like every other Populist Conservative Personality, is set up in a major coastal city. (Ingraham's studio is in Washington, D.C. So is Carlson's. Tomi Lahren lives in Los Angeles. Sean Hannity works out of Manhattan.) But then there's the idea Queens is not part of Real America.
The subtext here, of course, is that Queens is some alien entity. But there are Real American White People in Queens, too—they just live alongside people with roots all over the world. One three-block section of Queens is home to people who came there from 51 nations, the vast majority of whom came here to work hard and find a better life for themselves and their families. To those who believe America is a nation for anyone willing to buy into the values and the promise of the American Experiment, of course Queens is Real America. So, too, is Iowa, so long as being an Iowan is about what you believe and how you behave, not your complexion or when your great-grandfather got off the boat.

","Exposing a longstanding lie blunt even by his standards, President Trump on Sunday confessed by tweet that the purpose of the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting between his campaign and a Kremlin-linked lawyer was “to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics.”
It was left to his lawyer Jay Sekulow to try to clean up the mess. Addressing whether the meeting constituted a criminal violation, Sekulow told George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s “This Week” that “you have to look at what laws, rules, regulations, statutes are purportedly violated here.”
So let’s do that. Meeting with a foreign power to get assistance with a presidential campaign is not totally legal; special counsel Robert S. Mueller III almost certainly could indict Donald Trump Jr. today for what is publicly known about the meeting; and the president should be deeply concerned about his own liability.
Mueller’s February indictment of the Internet Research Agency, and associated Russian entities and individuals, charged a conspiracy to influence the election to damage Hillary Clinton, Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and support Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump — let’s call it an electioneering conspiracy. The indictment charged violations of 18 U.S. Code § 371 — conspiracy to commit an offense against, or to defraud United States.

The Trump Tower meeting clearly fits established definitions of “conspiracy to defraud the United States.”
Under the “defraud clause,” as precedent and the U.S. Attorneys’ Manual make clear, the statute criminalizes “any conspiracy for the purpose of impairing, obstructing or defeating the lawful function of any department of government,” even if the object of the conspiracy is not a criminal offense. According to Mueller’s indictment, the conspiracy sought to defraud the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice — the agencies charged with preventing foreign nationals from making contributions, donations or expenditures (which can include not just money, but any “thing of value”) that would influence U.S. elections.
Conspiracy law, it’s important to note, punishes the act of agreeing to a forbidden goal regardless of whether that goal is achieved. So long as the government can establish that targets agreed to pursue the conspiratorial objective, they may be prosecuted as co-conspirators. Conspirators need only agree to help bring about the object of a conspiracy even if they are not aware of all the details of the conspiracy itself. For example, in “chain-conspiracies” usually involving narcotics, lower-level buyers and sellers are included in larger distribution conspiracy so long as they have some understanding of the existence of the larger plot.
The Trump Tower meeting clearly fits established definitions of “conspiracy to defraud the United States.” In early June, Trump Jr. received an email explaining that a Russian government official wanted to provide his father’s campaign with incriminating documents and information about Clinton as part of “Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr. replied, “if it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.” The June 9 meeting was confirmed two days earlier, on June 7. That night, Trump announced that he would “give a major speech” in the next week to discuss “all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons.”

On the face of it, Trump Jr. was approached by a foreign government seeking to influence an American election. Trump Jr. welcomed the possibility of influence, and candidate Trump’s actions, while circumstantial, indicate that he intended to make use of that information. It is irrelevant, in conspiracy law, that Trump Jr. found the information ultimately worthless, or as Trump said, that “it went nowhere.”
Enter the Fray: First takes on the news of the minute from L.A. Times Opinion »
Michael Cohen’s allegations last week must have deeply terrified the president and those looking out for his legal interests. Cohen, the president’s former lawyer and “fixer,” reportedly is willing to tell Mueller that he was in the room when Trump heard about and approved the June 9 meeting. That would potentially place the president at the center of the decision to join the electioneering conspiracy. Trump’s later documented effort to dictate a false statement about the meeting looks like an attempt to cover up his culpability. A prosecutor and jury are entitled to view a cover-up as evidence of participation in the conspiracy.
More than one year after telling the world that the June 2016 meeting was about adoptions, Trump and his eldest son stand stripped of their false cover. There is no more denying that the meeting sought to enlist the help of a hostile power to swing the election Trump’s way. The effort and the false statements about it were plainly deplorable. Whether they also were illegal turns on questions of law that Trump cannot obfuscate or control. They are what they are. Mueller already has laid the legal predicate for the Trumps’ guilt. Trump is at last playing in a legit game, and his hand is weak.

","Sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.
Early this election cycle, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn publicly worried about complacency within the Texas Republican political class — even after Democratic gains made in 2018.
So in early 2019, the state’s senior senator encouraged Texas Republicans in the U.S. House to bolster their fundraising and think twice about sending money out of the state.
“There’s an attempt by the leadership to extract as much money as possible out of the state as they can and use that wherever they need it, and I understand that,"" he told The Texas Tribune in June 2019. “But we need to make sure our Texas races — from the president and all the way down to the courthouse — are adequately financed and resourced. And that’s going to require us to raise a significant amount of money.""
More than a year later, a Texas Tribune analysis of recent campaign finance reports shows that Cornyn's fears of a funding problem have come to life. Democratic U.S. House candidates in Texas have millions more aggregate cash on hand than their Republican counterparts. It marks an extraordinary six-year shift within the Texas delegation.
In 2016, U.S. House Republican candidates in Texas had $32.3 million on hand in July of that year. Their Democratic counterparts reported $11.4 million.
The next cycle, boosted by a backlash to President Donald Trump, Democrats saw a jump in fundraising. In 2018, Texas Republican U.S. House candidates had $34.8 million in cash on hand, compared with $21.8 million on the Democratic side.
Newly filed campaign finance reports show a complete shift this year. Republicans running for the U.S. House in Texas reported $19.2 million. Democrats had $26.7 million.
In some races, the outsized financial reserves will amount to little, thanks to precisely drawn congressional lines intended to reinforce Republican incumbent protection. But for a Texas Democratic ecosystem that was effectively moribund only six years ago, the ways in which these Democratic candidates are raising and spending their campaign funds point to a more sophisticated — and optimistic — approach to the fall general election campaign.
The data for this analysis was pulled from July campaign finance reports from the second quarter of each election year that congressional seats are on the ballot. Those reports are among the most critical in the cycle. Unless candidates have to compete in a primary, most spend the first 18 months of a campaign cycle raising and stockpiling money. The second quarter reports often mark a high point in cash-on-hand sums before candidates drain it all during the fall television advertising season.
This new Democratic cash sloshing around the state is being spent on staff payroll, printing shops and even direct mail and polling — all of which could well make a Democratic presence known in otherwise ignored deeply GOP pockets of the state.
Impact down the ballot
The heart of the disparity exists in five U.S. House district races: The 7th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd and the 32nd.
Two are races with Democratic incumbents, U.S. Reps. Colin Allred of Dallas and Lizzie Pannill Fletcher of Houston. Each faces a serious Republican opponent — businesswoman Genevieve Collins is challenging Allred and veteran Wesley Hunt is against Pannill Fletcher. Both Republican candidates have about $1 million in cash on hand, indicating they are taking fundraising seriously. Collins has self-funded her campaign in part.
But the Democratic candidates spent their first terms fully leveraging their incumbencies: Allred reported $3 million, and Fletcher posted $3.5 million in cash on hand.
Elsewhere, Democratic candidates Sri Preston Kulkarni and Gina Ortiz Jones of the 22nd and 23rd districts, respectively, outperformed expectations when they ran for the same offices in 2018. That gave them a strong case to make to donors heading into 2020. They locked down their nominations in March and spent the spring and summer raising money while Republicans litigated expensive runoff contests.
In the 21st District, Democrat and former state Sen. Wendy Davis outraised freshman U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Austin, by a nearly 3-1 margin.
There are also outliers in the cash on hand on both sides.
For instance, freshman U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Houston, has a growing national profile and reported $4 million on hand at the end of June.
Another freshman Republican, U.S. Rep. Michael Cloud of Victoria, represents a mostly noncompetitive conservative district in southeast Texas. He reported $344,000 in cash on hand, a sum that is on par with many incumbents of both parties. His Democratic rival, Ricardo De La Fuente, reported $1.1 million, almost all thanks to a candidate loan.
There is almost no chance Republican candidates in top-tier competitive races will be significantly short on money. And a Republican billionaire could still cut a seven-figure check to a GOP super PAC and reset the table in a U.S. House race overnight.
The conservative group Club for Growth indicated recently that it plans to spend at least $2.5 million supporting Roy in his race, for instance. Another super PAC, the Congressional Leadership Fund, named Fletcher in the spring as one of their top targets and put $3 million in television spending behind that announcement.
Even so, candidate fundraising is still a foundational block to campaigns. Candidates secure lower ad rates than outside groups, which is particularly crucial in expensive media markets like the ones where these races are being litigated: Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Austin and San Antonio.
And the money affects more than just the seven or so competitive U.S. House races on the ballot.
Take the state's 3rd Congressional District. Situated entirely in North Texas' Collin County, it has been a longtime undisputed GOP stronghold. Mitt Romney won the district in 2012 with 64% of the vote to Barack Obama’s 34%. But in 2018, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, carried the county by only six percentage points, and U.S. Rep. Van Taylor of Plano saw the district’s margin narrow from 27 points in 2016 to 10 points during his first run for the seat in 2018.
Taylor took that race seriously, advertising on broadcast television, and he has over $1 million in cash on hand this year. His opponent, attorney Lulu Seikaly, only had about $40,000 on her last financial report, but the way she is spending that money is noteworthy. That same report revealed she had hired a national direct mail consultant. Additionally, her campaign said in a news release that it had raised $100,000 since the mid-July runoff and has had a well-regarded polling firm conduct an internal poll of the race.
Should a Democratic wave hit the state in the fall, Seikaly will already have poll-tested messaging and located vendors to potentially take advantage of the environment. If not, her efforts to bring Democrats in her district to the polls could still help others in her party above and below her on ballot. Taylor's district overlaps considerably with that of state Rep. Jeff Leach, R-Plano, who is one of more than a dozen GOP incumbents Democrats are targeting in an effort to flip the state House.
Beyond the candidate fundraising, millions more in Democratic dollars will pound the state. The national parties and aligned super PACs are postured to dump tens of millions of dollars into the targeted U.S. House races, the fight for the state House and, potentially, the Senate race. Republicans are expected to respond in kind but the difference is, before 2018, these Democratic groups mostly ignored the state, save for the Texas 23rd Congressional District in west Texas.
This year, the spending will be in every major media market.
Multiple factors
The reasons for the deficit are more complicated than mere complacency on the Republican side.
A handful of Republican members who hold top committee positions or are running for those slots — U.S. Reps. Kevin Brady of the Woodlands, Michael Burgess of Lewisville and Kay Granger of Fort Worth — have transferred significant portions of their campaign funds to the House GOP campaign arm to bolster their support among House members.
And about a year ago, some of the biggest Republican fundraisers in the delegation announced their retirements. There was U.S. Rep. Will Hurd of Helotes, who raised millions each year for his inevitably difficult reelection campaign each fall. There were also U.S. Reps. Mac Thornberry of Clarendon, Bill Flores of Bryan, Pete Olson of Sugar Land, Kenny Marchant of Coppell and Mike Conaway of Midland. All had leadership roles or choice committee assignments and with that, obligations to raise money for colleagues.
In most retirements, incumbents spend their last year or so in office cutting back on fundraising and political activity. The candidates who replace them on the ballot raised and spent big money in their primaries and are only now turning to the general election. Some of those Republican candidates are all but certain to come to Congress, but others will face formidable Democrats in the fall.
There are also currently three fewer Republican members than there were in the past two cycles at this point. Two Republican members lost re-election last cycle and another seat, the 4th District, is in the process of choosing nominees for a special election to succeed former U.S. Rep. John Ratcliffe, who is now serving as the director of National Intelligence.
Also, the biggest difference between 2018 and 2020 is that the GOP no longer holds a majority in the U.S. House, and it is a law of political gravity that the party with the gavel has a much easier time raising money.
Additionally, numerous Texas Republicans noted, several of the primary races to replace retiring GOP members were only decided two weeks ago in a later-than-usual runoff. It makes sense, they argue, that so many of their candidates are broke. But now that the general election here, they will benefit from a burst of fundraising. Democrats counter that logic by noting that several of their own House candidates, too, faced financially exhausting runoffs.
Even so, the disparity bothers some national Republicans who are increasingly worried about resources across the map and particularly in Texas.
For his part, Cornyn is a source of stability within the Republican slate. He reported $14.5 million in cash on hand on June 30 and has raised $22.4 million over the course of this cycle. By comparison, his Democratic competitor, MJ Hegar, had about $900,000 and likely depleted that sum in the final weeks of her runoff against state Sen. Royce West of Dallas.
Since Hegar clinched the nomination, her campaign touted raising $1 million in the first week after the runoff. Republicans who care about this race are closely watching her progress with worry, as they see Democratic Senate candidates in other states catch national fundraising interest and bank tens of millions of dollars a quarter.
Cornyn is a former chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, a post in which he oversaw the raising and spending of hundreds of millions of dollars to elect Republicans to the Senate in the 2010 and 2012 cycles.
And that makes his 2019 comments about raising and keeping money back home all the more remarkable. Cornyn, like most Texans dating back to Lyndon B. Johnson, climbed the ranks of Capitol Hill by directing Texas money to colleagues elsewhere in the country.
But this cycle, he is telegraphing that the best service he and other Texas Republicans can be to his party is to take care of business back home.
“We are, I think, no longer the reliably red state we have been,” he said in 2019. “We are at risk of turning purple; and if we don’t do our job, then we could well turn blue in the coming years.”"

","In particular, the state prosecutors are examining whether the company falsely accounted for the reimbursements as a legal expense. In New York, filing a false business record can be a crime.
But it becomes a felony only if prosecutors can prove that the false filing was made to commit or conceal another crime, such as tax violations or bank fraud. The tax returns and other documents sought from Mazars could shed light on whether any state laws were broken. Such subpoenas also routinely request related documents in connection with the returns.
Democrats have insisted for years that Mr. Trump release his tax returns, which every modern presidential nominee has done before him. They contend that the president may be trying to conceal details of his actual financial worth, the source of his wealth and possible conflicts of interest involving his business partners.
Congressional Democrats have taken an aggressive approach, subpoenaing six years of Mr. Trump’s tax returns from the Treasury Department, as well as personal and corporate financial records from Deutsche Bank, Capital One and Mazars USA.
The president has fought back to keep his finances under wraps, challenging the subpoenas in federal court. He has also sued to block a New York State law, passed this year, that authorized state officials to provide his state tax returns in response to certain congressional inquiries. By tying up the requests in court, Mr. Trump’s team has made it diminishingly likely that Democrats in Washington will get the chance to review them before the election next year.
But it may be more difficult to fend off a subpoena in a criminal investigation with a sitting grand jury, as there is in Manhattan. It is possible the Trump Organization could try to negotiate with the district attorney’s office to narrow the scope of the subpoena.
Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, and Marc L. Mukasey, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, both declined to comment."

","Trump’s invocation of “lawsuits & harrassment” was a reference to the state’s numerous lawsuits against his administration and also against Trump’s business, which is based in New York.
That prompted Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), one of the House managers who prosecuted Trump’s impeachment in the Senate, to accuse the president of “expanding his abuse of power to blackmailing U.S. states (threatening millions of people he supposedly works for). In this case, he's holding New York state hostage to try to stop investigations into his prior tax fraud.”
State attorney general Letitia James has subpoenaed for Trump’s financial records, and the state is pursuing multiple inquiries about the Trump Organization’s business practices. James also just secured a $2 million settlement from Trump’s now-defunct charitable foundation, which was accused of numerous violations of misuse of funds.
The settlement prompted a sharp rebuke from Trump, who tweeted on Nov. 7 that James’ suit against the foundation was for “political purposes.”
“When you stop violating the rights and liberties of all New Yorkers, we will stand down,” James said Thursday, responding to Trump’s tweet. “Until then, we have a duty and responsibility to defend the Constitution and the rule of law. BTW, I file the lawsuits, not the Governor.”
Trump’s linkage of the investigations and lawsuits to his national security-related decisions involving New York immediately called back to House Democrats’ warning that Trump — if acquitted in last week’s impeachment trial — could leverage federal resources to coerce states to take actions that benefit him personally or politically.
“An acquittal would also provide license to President Trump and his successors to use taxpayer dollars for personal political ends ... Presidents could also hold hostage federal funds earmarked for States — such as money for natural disasters, highways, and healthcare — unless and until State officials perform personal political favors,” the House wrote in its impeachment trial brief. “Any Congressional appropriation would be an opportunity for a President to solicit a favor for his personal political purposes — or for others to seek to curry favor with him. Such an outcome would be entirely incompatible with our constitutional system of self-government.”
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler drew a link between Trump’s tweet about New York and the “quid pro quo” that got him impeached: withholding millions of dollars in military aid from Ukraine while demanding that the country investigate his Democratic rivals.
“Dear @SenateGOP, This is what another quid pro quo by the President of the United States looks like,” Nadler tweeted, pointing to Trump’s comment.
Some Capitol Hill Democrats compared Trump’s tweet to his July 25 conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when, after Zelensky referenced the U.S. provision of Javelin missiles to Ukraine, Trump pivoted to a request for the country to investigate Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden, a political rival who had announced a 2020 challenge against him."

","Judge Brett Kavanaugh is expected to gain approval for the Supreme Court late Saturday afternoon after the Senate votes him in. But he could be a justice that most of America does not want.
Kavanaugh could represent the fourth out of nine justices nominated by a president who did not initially win the popular vote when elected.
Kavanaugh would join Justice Neil Gorsuch, who President Donald Trump nominated last year, as well as President George W. Bush's picks of Justices John Roberts and Samuel Alito during his administration.
Trump famously lost the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton by nearly three million ballots in 2016, or 46.1 percent to 48.2 percent.
Bush first lost the popular vote to Al Gore in 2000 by just over 500,000 votes, but defeated John Kerry in 2004 by more than three million.
Bush did not have opportunity to nominate a Supreme Court justice in his first term, but was able to select now Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito in 2005, the first year of his second term.
Kavanaugh saw support from Trump's backers dwindle as the confirmation process dragged on amid allegations of sexual assault from his time in high school and college.
In particular, Kavanaugh began to lose support from the public after Christine Blasey Ford said he assaulted her during a high school party in 1982 and Deborah Ramirez said Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party while they attended Yale.
Kavanaugh firmly denied every allegation against him, including one of drugging young women and attending parties where women were gang raped.
Three separate polls showed Kavanaugh losing support after Ford made her accusations before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, and a Survey Monkey poll conducted between Wednesday and Thursday showed 50 percent disapproved of Kavanaugh's nomination while 45 percent approved.
The country was staunchly divided along partisan lines over Kavanaugh, which was reflected in the Senate's vote Friday to move along his nomination to a final vote Saturday afternoon.
The Senate voted 51-49 in favor of Kavanaugh with swing vote GOP Senators Susan Collins and Jeff Flake supporting Kavanaugh, while Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia the only Democrat and Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska the sole Republican to break from their respective parties.
After hours of floor time, the Senate is expected to hold a final vote on Kavanaugh around 3:30 p.m. ET."

","Conservatives frequently claim Facebook is biased against them. Facebook employees say it's the other way around.
While Facebook has been resistant to fact checking content on its site, it has gathered a team of fact checkers who are supposed to flag blatant or harmful misinformation. But Facebook employees say that hasn't happened when misinformation comes from conservative outlets, creating a ""pattern of preferential treatment for right-wing publishers and pages,"" BuzzFeed News reports.
The spread of misinformation on Facebook has worried its employees, who reportedly asked CEO Mark Zuckerberg last Friday why the far-right site Breitbart News is still a Facebook News partner, receiving compensation and special placement on Facebook's news tab, after promoting unfounded coronavirus treatments and saying masks aren't necessary. Zuckerberg reportedly responded that Breitbart had one strike of misinformation against it in the past 90 days, and it needs two to be removed from the news tab.
But Facebook employees say Breitbart, along with other conservative publishers including Charlie Kirk, Diamond and Silk, and Prager University, have all ""received special treatment"" and had some misinformation overlooked, BuzzFeed continues. ""It appears that policy people have been intervening in fact-checks on behalf of *exclusively* right-wing publishers, to avoid them getting repeat-offender status,"" one employee wrote on an internal message board.
Employees say they're concerned about more than just incorrect information and conspiracy theories. ""I do think we're headed for a problematic scenario where Facebook is going to be used to aggressively undermine the legitimacy of the U.S. elections, in a way that has never been possible in history,"" one employee wrote on an internal message board this week.

","The new Congress will be seated in a matter of days — but it is almost certain that the seat from the North Carolina Ninth Congressional District will be left empty, as more evidence of a brazen vote-tampering scheme piles up.
The bipartisan state elections board has refused to certify the results of Republican Mark Harris’s win and instead set a hearing on the election fraud scandal for January 11, a week after new members are sworn in.
Harris beat Democrat Dan McCready by roughly 900 votes on Election Day. But those results have been marred by explosive allegations that an operative working for the Harris campaign collected, tampered with or even destroyed absentee ballots. The alleged plot is now the subject of a state inquiry; the findings of the state investigation will be presented at the hearing next month.
Depending on the outcome, a new election could be called. The state board has broad discretion under state law to call a new election if the basic fairness of the November vote is in doubt. The number of ballots in question notably does not need to exceed the margin between Harris and McCready.
The evidence continues to pile up. On Christmas Eve, Joe Bruno, a reporter for the local news outlet WSOC, added another piece to the puzzle. Three voters testified in sworn affidavits that they had filled out their absentee ballots and then given them to a person who came to their house and promised to deliver the ballots to state officials to be counted.
Bruno checked public voting records and found that none of those voters had actually had their ballots counted.
NEW: Three say they gave their absentee ballots to strangers who promised to turn them in to officials.
They all said they don't know if they were turned in.
I checked the voter database. There's no record of these three voting in the 2018 election. Story at 6 @wsoctv #NC09 pic.twitter.com/S0BFyyrrSm — Joe Bruno (@JoeBrunoWSOC9) December 24, 2018
The picture isn’t yet complete, but the evidence we do have suggests that this could very well be one of the most duplicitous election fraud schemes in recent memory. Let’s tick through the evidence.
What we know — and don’t know — about the alleged ballot tampering
It’s important to remember two things about absentee ballots in North Carolina: Anybody can request one, and, at the end of every day before the election, state officials publish a file of which voters requested an absentee ballot by mail and whether they have returned it to be counted.
A campaign could wake up every morning and check that file to know how many registered Republican, Democratic, and unaffiliated voters had requested and returned a mail-in ballot.
“From a mechanics point of view, this is a goldmine of information for candidates and their campaign,” Michael Bitzer, a politics professor at Catawba College, told me previously.
With that in mind, here is some of what we know so far about the alleged ballot tampering scheme in the North Carolina Ninth Congressional District:
Two counties in the district, Bladen and Robeson, had an unusually high number of absentee ballots that were requested but not returned for the 2018 election.
Several voters in those counties said in sworn affidavits that an unidentified woman came to their house and collected their absentee ballots. One voter said the woman promised to finish filling out the incomplete ballot for them. Another voter said the ballot was not signed or sealed when the woman took it.
In an interview with WSOC, the voter who said she’d selected her choices for only two offices on the ballot before handing it away identified Lisa Britt as the woman who collected her mail-in ballot.
Britt is the stepdaughter of Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr., a political contractor in the area, BuzzFeed News reported.
Dowless was paid by the Harris campaign and was doing absentee work specifically, according to the Charlotte Observer and other affidavits sent to the state elections board. He was previously caught up in allegations regarding absentee ballots in 2016. The Harris campaign still owes $34,000 for absentee ballot work it hired outside contractors for, the New York Times reported.
Britt and another woman related to Dowless, Jessica Dowless, told BuzzFeed News they were working for Dowless at an office during the campaign. They described counting the number of Democrats and Republicans who had voted. Absentee ballots were collected and brought to the offices. Dowless was paying his workers cash, even buying one person a car, and some of the staff were using drugs while on the job, per BuzzFeed News’s reporting.
Britt and Jessica Dowless were two people who witnessed an unusually high number of absentee ballots that were submitted in Bladen County, according to Judd Legum at Popular Information. Jessica said she was asked to witness ballots that had been brought back to Dowless’s offices.
That is a lot of smoke, and you can see the contours of the scheme: People working to support the Republican campaign were collecting absentee ballots en masse and serving as witnesses for them.
But we don’t know a few critical pieces of information:
What actually happened to the ballots that were requested but not returned in Bladen and Robeson counties?
How much did the Harris campaign know about Dowless’s activities?
Was the unusual activity limited to Bladen and Robeson counties, or are absentee ballots from other counties also in doubt?
Without the answers to those questions, it’s hard to say definitively what the precise scheme was — though the new evidence uncovered by WSOC suggests ballots may have been destroyed or discarded. There were already legitimate concerns those ballots were mishandled, given the testimony of ballots that were collected unfinished or unsealed. We can say that much for sure.
But the list of outstanding questions is long. Another one: Were specific voters targeted? Jessica Dowless indicated to BuzzFeed News that ballots for Democratic or black (or both) voters were a focus, but later seemed to walk that claim back.
Bitzer ran the numbers and found something odd about the absentee ballots in Bladen County: Harris would have needed to win every single unaffiliated voter and a good number of Democrats in order to rack up the margins he saw on absentee ballots there.
But again, that data gestures at impropriety but doesn’t provide a smoking gun. That’s what we’re waiting on.
The number of not-returned absentee ballots in the Ninth was unusually high
Most of the attention has focused on two counties in the Ninth: Bladen and Robeson, in the southeast corner of the state near the South Carolina border. Notably, each of the affidavits provided by Democratic attorneys involved voters in Bladen County, and one man said that Dowless himself had stated he was working on absentee ballots for Harris in the county.
Bitzer documented the unusual trend in those counties: They had a much higher rate of mail-in absentee ballots that were requested but not returned, compared to other counties in the Ninth District.
And at the district level, according to Bitzer’s calculations, the Ninth had a much higher rate of unreturned absentee ballots than any other district in North Carolina.
Bitzer also found that the share of votes Harris received from mail-in absentee ballots in Bladen was remarkably high. It was the only county where the Republican won the mail-in absentee vote, earning 61 percent to McCready’s 38 percent.
Strangely, though, based on the partisan breakdown of absentee ballots accepted in the county, Harris would have needed to win not only all of the Republican ballots but also almost every single ballot from voters not registered with either party and a substantial number of Democratic ballots as well.
Much like the sworn affidavits, there isn’t an outright allegation of wrongdoing to be found here. But the suggestion is pretty clear: Harris seems to have benefitted from an oddly high share of votes in these two counties, where an operative of his was allegedly working, and where a number of voters said that their absentee ballots had been collected from them in a highly unusual manner."

","Two New Yorkers, vastly different but both aggressive in their own way. She, Letitia “Tish” James, blasted through social barriers by becoming the first black woman to be elected New York’s attorney general. Soon, she will have the power of her office to become one of President Trump’s main legal nemeses, to go after him where it could hurt the most: in his hometown.
During the campaign, James, a Democrat, said she intends to aggressively investigate Trump’s businesses and finances. On the night of her victory, she stood in front of supporters in Brooklyn and all but declared a war against Trump: “I will be shining a bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings, and every dealing, demanding truthfulness at every turn.”

Now, many eyes are on James, a former public defender who defied her father’s wishes by becoming a lawyer instead of marrying a plumber. At 60, she would be at the helm of investigations that could personally affect the president of the United States. The White House and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. In several tweets criticizing the New York attorney general’s office, Trump said the agency will soon be headed by someone “who openly campaigned on a GET TRUMP agenda.”
James’s bluntness about Trump is not unheard of, as Democratic and Republican state attorneys general become more partisan and use their office to file lawsuits against the other party, said Paul Nolette, a Marquette University political science professor. Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott (R), for example, often joked that when he was attorney general, he would get up in the morning, sue President Barack Obama and go home.
Republicans probably would accuse James of operating her office based on partisan politics and not the rule of law, said Nolette, who studies how attorneys general have used and expanded their power. The reality, he said, is a combination of both: “There’s no taking the political considerations out of these lawsuits.”
AD
AD
James’s ascension to New York’s top legal office comes amid mounting legal threats against Trump from multiple fronts. His campaign, his company, his charity and his inaugural committee are all under investigation by federal and state officials, including James’s predecessor, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood.
James is now part of an energized group of Democratic attorneys general who have turned courtrooms across the country into battlegrounds against the president’s agenda on immigration, sanctuary cities, the environment and health care, to name a few issues. Democratic attorneys general, who will now occupy more seats than Republicans, have filed more than 60 multistate lawsuits against the Trump administration — a record number, Nolette said.
But New York, by virtue of being located in the same state as the president’s businesses and charities, is the most important, Nolette said.

The groundwork has been laid for James.

New York has more than 200 legal actions against Trump and his administration. On Tuesday, Underwood announced that Trump has agreed to shut down his embattled charity after the attorney general’s office filed a lawsuit accusing Trump of using his foundation for his personal and political benefit. The agency is also investigating whether Trump’s business practices in New York violated the emoluments clause, which prohibits federal officials from taking money from a foreign state. And Underwood, who has accused Trump of abusing his pardon power, has advocated legislation that would allow New York officials to charge someone who has been pardoned by the president over a federal crime.
James, who has built a reputation for going after who she calls “the worst landlords in New York City,” said among her first priorities is investigating Trump, the landlord in chief. She said she will look into whether the Trump family violated the rights of tenants in New York to enrich themselves. The New York Times reported that the Trump family created a phony business to mark up the cost of purchases for their father’s buildings, allowing them to raise rents.
James was born and raised in Brooklyn. Her father was a maintenance man. Her mother scrubbed floors before working her way up to customer service. They wanted their daughter to marry and have children, but James wanted more.
AD
AD
“I was a tomboy and into sports. I was into books. I was not interested in getting married,” James said.
When she was about 10, she saw a black woman on the subway and decided she wanted to be just like her. Someday, she recalled thinking, she would also dress in a suit and pantyhose, and she would carry a briefcase. As a teenager, she spent many days in a courtroom, watching her brother go through the legal system over a false bike theft accusation, she said. None of the lawyers looked like her, but nearly all of the defendants did, so she vowed to pay her way through college and to one day walk the halls of Howard University School of Law.
James became a public defender. One of her sisters became a New York police detective. At home, the joke was that her sister would lock people up, and James would get them out.
AD

James first entered politics in 2001, after a few years as an assistant attorney general. She ran unsuccessfully for the City Council in Brooklyn, but the man who defeated her was shot and killed by a political rival two years later. She ran for the vacant seat and won, and served on the council for nearly a decade. In 2014, she became New York’s public advocate, the city’s second-highest elected office and a watchdog of sorts for the people.
“For the consuming public, it wasn’t always clear what the public advocate could do for them, and I think Tish made it really clear what the public advocate could do for them,” said Anthony Crowell, dean of New York Law School and a counselor to Michael Bloomberg when he was the city’s mayor. “Tish did it as a platform of advocacy in sort of every sense of the word.”
James pushed the limits of her office by filing a record number of lawsuits on behalf of tenants, seniors, students with disabilities and foster children, some of which put her at odds with New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat. The results were mixed. There had been victories, such as securing more heating for tenants in freezing New York apartments. But James also had been forced out of some of the high-profile cases after the court found she had no legal standing to sue — something her Republican opponent in the attorney general race, Keith Wofford, raised during a debate in October.
AD
AD
Wofford, a New York lawyer, did not respond to requests for comment.
James also had been accused of being overly litigious, though she said she regrets nothing.
“I don’t apologize for taking legal risks on behalf of New Yorkers and stretching the boundaries of the law to protect the rights of individuals being abused,” James said.
Friends and colleagues say she tackled issues with fervor, whether they involved keeping library services in Brooklyn, calling out officials from Bloomberg’s administration for a failed response to a snowstorm, suing a mortgage company over predatory lending to black and Latino victims, or lobbying for police body cameras.
AD
“Her experience as a lawyer is representing individuals, and that, to me, is hugely important change,” said Daniel O’Donnell, a New York State Assembly member. “She didn’t come out representing corporate America.”
AD
During the primary election, James emerged as the establishment candidate following an endorsement and fundraising boosts by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D). Progressives critical of Cuomo raised concerns about James’s independence from the governor. George Albros, leader of the New York Progressive Action Group, which endorsed one of James’s primary opponents, did not respond to requests for comment.
Andrew G. Celli Jr., a New York City lawyer who worked with James when she was assistant attorney general, dismissed notions that she lacked independence.
AD
“If you want to see how much of an outsider she is, look at the way she behaved as a public advocate. She was very aggressive and very much her own woman, and set up as a counterbalance to Mayor de Blasio,” Celli said. “She was the establishment candidate — doesn’t mean she’s an establishment person.”
AD
James called Trump a “street fighter” and said she looks forward to a “very spirited relationship.”
“I look forward to the first tweet,” she said last week. “I’m going to consider that a badge of honor.”
And on Wednesday, it happened.

","Biden Gains 87 Net Votes In Partial Wisconsin Recount Requested By Trump
Enlarge this image toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images
Updated at 3:30 p.m. ET Sunday
A partial recount in Wisconsin concluded Sunday with President-elect Joe Biden's winning margin over President Trump increasing by 87 total votes.
Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell told reporters Sunday that Trump netted a gain of 45 votes in the county, which includes the capital Madison. That followed Friday's completed recount in the state's most populous county, Milwaukee, where out of roughly 460,000 ballots cast, Biden made a net gain of 132 votes on review.
The results offer unwelcome news for Trump, who lost to Biden in Wisconsin by roughly 20,000 votes, and lost the national popular vote by more than 6 million.
The Trump campaign paid the Wisconsin Elections Commission a fee of $3 million to proceed with recounts in Milwaukee and Dane counties. The two counties, which together account for roughly a quarter of the state's population, swung heavily for Biden with 69% and 75% of the vote, respectively.
Trump said on Twitter Saturday that his team will file a lawsuit challenging Wisconsin's results prior to the state's certification deadline on Tuesday.
Trump and his allies have repeatedly and baselessly claimed that widespread fraud decided the election for his rival — not just in Wisconsin but also in other battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan. Those claims have not held up in court, however, and Trump's legal setbacks have mounted in recent weeks.
""Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so,"" federal appellate Judge Stephanos Bibas wrote in an opinion released Friday denying the Trump campaign's challenge of the results in Pennsylvania. ""Charges require specific allegations and then proof,"" said Bibas, whom Trump nominated to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017. ""We have neither here.""
The defeats have failed to dissuade Trump, who continued to tweet false claims overnight, saying without evidence that the votes against him in Pennsylvania and ""all other swing states"" were ""RIGGED.""
Still, his efforts may be having the unintended effect of underlining the veracity of the election results. Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson said Friday that the recount's results should affirm voters' faith in the election process.
""The recount demonstrates what we already know: that elections in Milwaukee County are fair, transparent, accurate and secure,"" he said Friday, according to Reuters.
And on Sunday, Dane County's McDonell told reporters that the recount showed ""there was absolutely no evidence of voter fraud in this election.""

","Greyhound Lines will no longer allow Border Patrol agents to conduct immigration checks on its buses without warrants, the company announced on Friday — one week after a leaked government memo revealed that agents could not board buses without consent.
The memo appeared to take Greyhound by surprise. For years, the company, the largest operator of intercity buses in America, had been allowing border agents to board its vehicles without warrants, citing a law that it said it didn’t agree with.
“C.B.P. searches have negatively impacted both our customers and our operations,” the company said in 2018, referring to Customs and Border Protection, the Border Patrol’s parent agency. “Greyhound does not coordinate with C.B.P., nor do we support these actions.”
But in the leaked memo, which was first reported by The Associated Press, the Border Patrol chief confirmed that agents were prohibited from boarding buses and questioning passengers without warrants or the company’s consent."

","Perhaps another Republican president would’ve handled this differently. President Marco Rubio likely wouldn’t have been so singularly focused on trying to make the TV say things are fine. But after two terms of George W. Bush and three years of President Trump, is there any reason for confidence that Rubio would’ve handled this significantly better?
This is how conservatives govern now, and even eight years of comparatively competent management by a liberal presidential administration was not enough to stem the larger trend of private negligence and public disinvestment. In its 2019 annual report on American public health funding, Trust for America’s Health calculated that “the CDC’s budget fell by 10 percent over the past decade (FY 2010–19), after adjusting for inflation.”
Many Americans seem to still believe we live in a country with functional institutions. Even as broadly defined “trust” in Congress and the government collapsed, this belief persisted: In 2017, with Trump in office, Pew still found that more than 60 percent of Americans believed the government did a good job “protecting the environment and responding to natural disasters.” Indeed, a lot of the conservative project of corrupting or starving government agencies depends on an almost touching belief in the resiliency of the institutions liberalism built in the twentieth century. Even the people dismantling the government probably believed, at some level, that the CDC could effectively address a massive public health crisis even though its new director was unqualified and its budget had declined for years. Despite its grip on power, the conservative movement cannot adapt to the circumstances created by its victory over the state. It didn’t occur to the right that a more terrifying series of words than “I’m from the government, and I’m here to help” would turn out to be “I’m from the government, and I guess I anticipated that the private sector would have engaged.”
There is perhaps only one competent and uncorrupted top-ranking official left in the federal government’s public health bureaucracy. The Department of Health and Human Services had its entire email system crash because the secretary is in a fight with the person who is ostensibly in charge of Medicare. The government added millions of masks and respirators to the Strategic National Stockpile in 2009, then forgot about them and forgot to buy more. Five million of the N95 respirators have expired."

","David Koch, the billionaire conservative activist and philanthropist, who was lauded by the right and rebuked by the left, has died.
He was 79.
“It is with a heavy heart that I announce the passing of my brother David,"" Charles Koch said in a statement Friday. ""Anyone who worked with David surely experienced his giant personality and passion for life.""
Charles Koch did not say how his brother died, but David Koch blamed deteriorating health when he stepped down last year from Koch Industries, a Kansas-based energy and chemical corporation with an annual revenue of about $110 billion.
Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics
David Koch, regarded as the more gregarious of the two brothers, served as the executive vice president of Koch Industries. He held a master's in chemical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Charles Koch, who also has engineering degrees from MIT, is the company's chairman and chief executive officer.
The brothers were tied as 11th richest in the world this year in a ranking by Forbes. At the time of his death, David Koch was worth $42.4 billion.
David and Charles Koch, along with their brothers, Frederick and Bill, inherited the business when their father, who founded it, died in 1967. Frederick and Bill Koch sold their stake in 1983, and in 1998 pursued an unsuccessful lawsuit against the other two brothers, claiming they were cheated when they were bought out of the private company. David and Bill were twins.
With the wealth from their business, David and Charles Koch helped to build a massive conservative network of donors for organizations that work to mobilize voters and sway elected officials in support of libertarian-leaning economic policies.
They founded the nonprofit Americans for Prosperity, which has spent more than $1 billion over the past several elections to support candidates who adhere to their free-market, small-government, libertarian ideals. While they distanced themselves from the movement, touting instead classic libertarian ideals, the brothers are also credited with helping to fuel the tea party.
While celebrated on the right, the Koch brothers are often regarded by Democrats as a symbol of the corrupting force of corporate money in American politics.
Koch money was used in fighting former President Barack Obama's health care initiatives and given to groups that deny climate change, undercut unions and oppose gun laws. It also contributed to the prominence and volume of issue-oriented political television ads.
But the Kochs had more recently split with the GOP under President Donald Trump — refraining from publicly endorsing him in 2016 and launching a multimillion-dollar campaign last year promoting free trade and warning against tariffs. Still, Trump's political rise is often partially attributed to their contributions to causes that championed the Trump agenda.
""David Koch lived long enough to see his dreams come true. Massive tax cuts for the rich, rampant environmental deregulation, America out of Paris accords,"" environmentalist and author Bill McKibben wrote on Twitter on Friday. ""He got what he paid for.""
David Koch himself ran as the Libertarian Party's vice presidential candidate in 1980. He and the party's presidential nominee, Ed Clark, won a little more than 1 percent of the vote.
""Today, our 1980 nominee for Vice President David Koch passed away. Often a focal point of political debate, David spent much of his life contributing and working in his own way toward what he believed in: a freer world,"" the Libertarian Party said in a statement Friday.
David Koch, who had survived prostate cancer, donated hundreds of millions of dollars to medical research.
""Memorial Sloan Kettering is tremendously grateful to David Koch and the legacy his leadership and generosity leaves for cancer research and treatment,"" said the New York cancer center's president and CEO Craig B. Thompson. ""His profound commitment to cancer will live on through a state-of-the-art outpatient center named in his honor and opening later this year.""
Koch was also a huge supporter of the arts, specifically in New York City where he lived. His donations included $65 million to support a renovation of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
“David Koch was an unwavering supporter of our Museum, reflected in his service as a trustee and his most generous philanthropic support. We are extremely grateful for his generosity and send our condolences to Julia and his entire family,"" a statement from the Met said. The museum's front plaza, which is adorned with two massive fountains and stretches four blocks, is named for Koch.
The David H. Koch Theater at the Lincoln Center and the David H. Koch Dinosaur Wing at the American Museum of Natural History also got their names following contributions from him.
And a wing at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History and MIT's Institute for Integrative Cancer Research were also named in his honor after multimillion-dollar donations.
When he was diagnosed with cancer 27 years ago, he was given five years to live, his brother said.
""David liked to say that a combination of brilliant doctors, state-of-the-art medications and his own stubbornness kept the cancer at bay,"" Charles Koch's statement said. ""We can all be grateful that it did, because he was able to touch so many more lives as a result.""
""The significance of David’s generosity is best captured in the words of Adam Smith, who wrote, ‘to indulge our benevolent affections, constitutes the perfection of human nature,'"" Charles Koch said.
David Koch is also survived by his wife, Julia, and their three children.
“While we mourn the loss of our hero, we remember his iconic laughter, insatiable curiosity, and gentle heart,"" Julia Koch said in a statement.
""His stories of childhood adventures enlivened our family dinners; his endless knowledge rendered him our ‘walking Google.’ His sensitive heart had him shed a tear at the beauty of his daughter’s ballet, and beam with pride when his son beat him at chess,"" she wrote. ""We will miss the fifth link in our family."""

The change indicates that information related climate change is not being “updated,” but removed entirely.

In April 2017, the EPA put out a press release announcing that EPA.gov would be changing to “reflect the agency’s new direction under President Donald Trump and Administrator Scott Pruitt.”
“The process, which involves updating language to reflect the approach of new leadership, is intended to ensure that the public can use the website to understand the agency's current efforts,” the April 2017 press release reads. “The changes will comply with agency ethics and legal guidance, including the use of proper archiving procedures.”
At that point, the EPA’s climate change subdomains were removed and were replaced by a page that said that the subdomains were being “updated.” The pages remained like this until the night between October 16 and 17, when the pages were updated to read “We want to help you find what you are looking for.”
There is no information related to climate change on any of the EPA’s climate change subdomains, and per the language of the EPA’s April 2017 press release, this reflects the priorities of the Trump Administration.

This is far from the first time that the Trump administration has removed information relating to climate change and environmental hazards. Shortly after Trump’s inauguration in January 2017, all references to climate change were removed from the White House website.

","Trump jumped in.
“Well, the trade deals won’t kick in for a while,” he said. “You know, number one, the USMCA” — the revised version of NAFTA that Trump’s administration negotiated with Canada and Mexico — “hasn’t even been approved yet. It has to go before Congress and get approved. Now, it should get approved quickly.”
AD
Before NAFTA, Trump said, “we had huge surpluses with Mexico. With NAFTA, we have huge deficits. We lose $100 billion a year on trade with Mexico. Does that sound good? And this has been going on for many years. So I stopped it. I stopped it a lot.”
AD
You probably noticed that Trump took a question that’s obviously about the federal budget deficit and gave an answer that dealt with the country’s trade deficits. Both are deficits, sure, but they relate to each other in about the same way that a tuning fork relates to a dinner fork. The term “deficit” describes something similar in each case, and they can even share similar properties, but the two are by no means equal.
If the entirety of trade between the United States and Mexico was your buying a $20,000 car from Mexico and selling someone there a $99 piece of software, the United States would have exported far less in goods than it imported, to the tune of $19,901. If, the next year, you sold another $99 software package but purchased only one $3 avocado, suddenly the United States would be running a trade surplus — $96 worth. That’s a change of nearly $20,000 in only one year!
AD
None of this money, though, affects what the government is doing. Your car or that avocado doesn’t go into the U.S. Treasury as a tax receipt.
AD
We could chalk this up to Trump mishearing the question were it not for the interview he gave to the New York Times a few hours later. Trump was asked if the tariffs he had imposed on China might remain in effect indefinitely even if the United States and China reached a broader trade agreement, as Trump hoped.
“Yeah, sure,” Trump replied. “We have 25 percent now on $50 billion. And by the way . . . that’s a lot of money pouring into our Treasury, you know. We never made 5 cents with China. We’re getting, right now, 25 percent on $50 billion. And then I was putting 25 percent at a later date, which date came and went — 25 percent or $200 billion.”
AD
Now, it is true that tariffs can generate revenue for the government. In 2017, the U.S. government generated $34.9 billion in “customs duties,” taxes paid on the import of products into the country. That made up just under 1 percent of all of the taxes collected that year. (The bulk came from income taxes.)
AD
If you’re curious, assuming that the U.S. government collected 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese products, that would be another $12.5 billion in revenue, but that’s probably not a fair assumption. The percentage of revenue that would constitute is about 1.3 percent.
But, as The Washington Post’s Heather Long pointed out when Trump suggested in August that tariffs would pay down the debt, it’s not the Chinese paying those tariffs — it’s the person or company doing the importing. In our example above, Trump slapping a 25 percent tariff on cars from Mexico would mean that you’d have to pay $5,000 to the government for your $20,000 Mexican car. No wonder you stuck to that avocado in year two.
AD
Put another way: The income the country is earning from those tariffs could more directly be generated by just raising taxes. Instead, Trump cut taxes — resulting in a plunge in corporate tax payments and a surge in the deficit that then drove the debt higher. Which is why that reporter asked about deficits and the debt in the Oval Office.
AD
All of this is admittedly better than the really bizarre comment Trump made during an interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity in October 2017. Hannity tossed up a softball about the economy, and Trump took a swing.
“The country — we took it over and owed over $20 trillion,” Trump said, referring to the national debt. “As you know, the last eight years, they borrowed more than it did in the whole history of our country. So they borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet we picked up $5.2 trillion just in the stock market. Possibly picked up the whole thing in terms of the first nine months, in terms of value. So you could say, in one sense, we’re really increasing values. And maybe, in a sense, we’re reducing debt.”
AD
There is no sense in which rising stock market valuations reduces the federal debt. The way the federal debt is reduced is either by cutting federal spending or increasing federal revenue, including through raising taxes. As president, Trump has made overtures at the former and rejected the latter, meaning that the nearly $20 trillion debt Trump inherited has now topped $21.5 trillion."

","The declaration comes after the 86-year-old justice, who has risen to an iconic status among liberals in recent years, dealt with a series of health issues over the past 12 or so months.
An appointee of President Bill Clinton, she missed oral arguments for the first time last January as she recovered from surgery to remove two malignant nodules in her left lung, which were discovered inspecting damage to her ribs from a fall.
She returned to the bench in February and received the pancreatic cancer diagnosis in August. Ginsburg had already beaten the disease twice, having been treated for colorectal cancer in 1999 and an earlier bout of pancreatic cancer in 2009.
She was hospitalized again just before last Thanksgiving with “chills and a fever,” but was released a day later.
Her interview with CNN comes as the court is set to resume oral arguments next week and could rule this year on a slate of hot button issues that include the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the fate of the Affordable Care Act, abortion rights and President Donald Trump’s financial records.
Ginsburg’s professed bill of clean health — which CNN noted she delivered while “sounding energized and speaking animatedly” — is sure to soothe fears on the left that she will remain in her seat on the court for the foreseeable future.
While Ginsburg was still recovering from lung cancer about a year ago, POLITICO reported that the White House had begun preparing for her possible death or departure from the court.
She has repeatedly batted down concerns regarding her health while maintaining an active schedule of public appearances and keeping up with court duties. She joked to NPR in July by recalling: “There was a senator, I think it was after my pancreatic cancer, who announced with great glee that I was going to be dead within six months. That senator, whose name I have forgotten, is now himself dead, and I am very much alive.”
Groups on both sides of the aisle have taken immense interest in her health, as an open seat would allow Trump to make his third appointment to the highest court in the land, and his first to replace a liberal justice — an appointment that would further tilt the balance of the court for decades.
Despite blocking a Supreme Court nominee from former President Barack Obama in an election year in 2016, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he would move to confirm a Trump nominee should a seat on the court open up in 2020."

","Republican lawmakers are growing increasingly nervous as special counsel Robert Mueller's net closes around President Donald Trump and his inner circle, even considering dumping the president to save the party, according to a guest on MSNBC's Deadline: White House program.
Speaking to host Nicolle Wallace on Monday, Eli Stokols—a White House reporter for the Los Angeles Times—said that concrete evidence of wrongdoing by Trump could make continued Republican support for the president untenable.

""There is some understanding, I think, inside the White House of just how dark it may be getting,"" the reporter said, adding that there were ""private conversations people there are having with Republicans on the Hill who are starting to be concerned.""
Stokols continued, noting that Republican lawmakers ""are starting to tell me privately—some of them—if there's obvious evidence, the bottom's going to fall out. They're not going to be able to stand by this White House and that's a looming problem for the president.""
In U.S. District Court for Southern District of New York last month, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to making misleading statements to Congress during testimony detailing his contact with Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign.
In a sentencing memo released last week following Cohen's most recent plea, Mueller noted that the lawyer—who has already been convicted of campaign finance violations—provided ""credible"" and ""useful"" information for the ongoing special counsel probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
Cohen had already pleaded guilty in August to illegally using campaign funds to make non-disclosure payments to two women alleged to have had affairs with Trump. Last week's memo noted he had done so at the direction of ""Individual 1""—i.e., Donald Trump.
Read more: Is Rudy Giuliani a leaker? Trump's lawyer fingered by Comey
Stokols said the Mueller investigation and the Southern District of New York both ""probably have a lot more evidence than just the word of Michael Cohen, and that has to worry the president.""
Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani have been characteristically stubborn in the face of the allegations. Soon after the sentencing memo was published, the president tweeted, ""Totally clears the President. Thank you!""
""Yes, he and Rudy Giuliani on some level believe that they can continue to attack the investigators, to try to convince the public that there is something nefarious and something politically motivated about this,"" Stokols told Wallace.
""But when all the facts are laid out and people can see the investigators' work, I think it's going to be very problematic for this president.
Wallace noted that the Southern District of New York prosecutors could, ""without all of the hoopla and politicking and attacks from the president…transmit their findings to Congress if they want to.""
Stokols confirmed that they could do so, explaining ""it's much harder to stop what's happening in that office as opposed to with the special counsel's investigation.
""This train has left the station, there's really nothing that this White House can do about it,"" he said. ""I think that's a source of frustration to the president, and also it's difficult to politicize. It's difficult to go out and demonize that office because, as you pointed out already, that's a Trump appointee running that office.""
On Sunday, Chris Christie—Republican former New Jersey governor and long-time Trump ally—told ABC's This Week that the president and his inner circle had good reason to be concerned. ""The language in the sentencing memo is different from what we've heard before,"" Christie told host George Stephanopoulos.
""The language sounds very definite. And what I'd be concerned about is, what corroboration do they have?"" he continued. ""When prosecutors sound that definitive they've got more usually than just one witness.""
This article has been updated to include comments made by Chris Christie."

","Polls just closed in six states and most of Florida, which means we might start to see some early signs of where the House is going.
Keep your eyes on Virginia: Virginia might be the most important early sign of where the House is going. The Democrats’ must-win there is in the 10th District, where strategists in both parties say Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock is unlikely to hold onto her seat in the DC suburbs. Republican Rep. Scott Taylor’s race in the Norfolk-area 2nd District, though, is a much better bellwether for the national environment. And if the GOP Rep. Dave Brat loses in the 7th District outside Richmond – or even if he’s in a tight race – it could be an early sign of a building Democratic wave.
Democrats saw one more district in Virginia emerge as competitive late in the cycle: the 5th District, where former journalist Leslie Cockburn takes on Republican Denver Riggleman, an Air Force veteran and distillery owner. A Democratic win here would be a sign of a tidal wave threatening to wipe out Republicans whose races weren’t even on the national radar.
The Atlanta suburbs feature two wave-maker districts – if Democrats win either, it’d mean they’re in for a big night. In Georgia’s 6th District, Republican Rep. Karen Handel – who won a ballyhooed special election against Jon Ossoff last year – faces Lucy McBath, a challenger whose unarmed son was shot and killed over a dispute about loud music. And in the 7th District, Republicans are furious that Rep. Rob Woodall never took his race seriously. “If you don’t think it behooves you to put paid media on air, we’re not going to come help you. We’re not a welfare organization,” a Republican official said.
Also keep your eye on a few wave-makers in Florida. The Tampa-area 15th District is an open seat that emerged as competitive late – so late, in fact, that Republicans couldn’t afford a rescue effort. On the Atlantic coast side, the 6th District’s open-seat contest for former Rep. Ron DeSantis’ old seat is another potential Democratic pick-up that would suggest the party is soaring past the 23 seats it needs for a House majority. If either of Republican Reps. Brian Mast or Vern Buchanan lose, it’s another sign that Democrats are on the path to winning the House.
House battleground: Miami. South Florida is the site of two House battlegrounds. In the 26th District, GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo has run well to his party’s left on issues like climate change and immigration, and Republicans need him to survive. In the 27th District, what should be an easy Democratic pick-up has become daunting, as former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala – the non-Spanish-speaking Democratic candidate in a majority Hispanic district – faces former Spanish-language broadcast journalist Maria Elvira Salazar.
History-makers. In Georgia, the headliner is the governor’s race between Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams, an emerging Democratic star who has combined a progressive platform with an appeal to black voters – all with a chance to become the nation’s first black female governor. If neither candidate tops 50%, the race will head to a runoff.
In Florida, a small portion of the panhandle is in Central time, so we’ll need to wait an extra hour for full results to come in for the governor’s race between Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, a progressive favorite, and DeSantis, who has aligned himself so closely with Trump that this is a potential preview of 2020.
Democrats’ Senate must-wins. The Florida Senate contest, with Republican Gov. Rick Scott challenging Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson, is one of the nation’s most expensive and closely watched – and if Nelson loses, it would severely diminish Democrats’ shot at a majority.
A Midwestern state-level resurgence? Democratic former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau head Richard Cordray will try to win the governor’s office in Ohio, a state Trump won by 9 percentage points in 2016. He faces Republican state Attorney General Mike DeWine. It’s the first of several such tests for Democrats, who also hope to reverse GOP gains in Michigan, Iowa and Wisconsin.

New results in the Arizona Senate race show Democrat Kyrsten Sinema continuing to build her lead over Republican Martha McSally.
After ballots from Maricopa and Pinal counties were added to the total on Sunday, Sinema now leads McSally by 32,292 votes, according to the Arizona secretary of state's office.
In a statement shortly after approximately 36,000 ballots from Maricopa County dropped, Sinema's campaign manager Andrew Piatt sounded triumphant.
“With the latest ballot count, Kyrsten’s lead is insurmountable. McSally’s campaign said today’s results would be her ‘firewall’ but as we expected, no firewall emerged,"" Piatt said.
He added that McSally would have to win the rest of the Maricopa ballots by a huge 22 percent margin to take the lead. ""This is not plausible,"" Piatt said. ""Kyrsten will be declared the next U.S. Senator from Arizona.”
Prior to the update from Maricopa County, Sinema was ahead of McSally by 30,416 votes.
The secretary of state's indefatigable data analyst Garrett Archer estimated that 211,000 ballots remain as of Sunday evening. These include 162,000 from Maricopa County and 36,300 from Pima County.
The race has yet to be called, but the votes for McSally have not kept pace with Sinema as the largest counties continue to tally their results, many of them early mail-in ballots cast on Election Day.
For the first time on Saturday, they both surpassed 1 million votes in the never-ending election to replace Republican Jeff Flake. In light of the new results, Democratic politico Robbie Sherwood predicted that it was ""game over.""
""The cavalry is not coming for @RepMcSally,"" he wrote on Twitter on Saturday.
Democrats have managed to come from behind in several races as Arizona continues to count ballots.
For the moment, the contests for superintendent and Corporation Commission have a Democrat in first place, while the secretary of state's race is a nail-biter.
In light of the new results, Democrat Kathy Hoffman, a 32-year-old first-time candidate for superintendent, declared victory on Sunday evening in her race against Republican Frank Riggs, but the race has not been called.
Nevertheless, Hoffman can boast of a 46,822-vote lead over Riggs, a former congressman from California. The latest ballots improve Hoffman's 43,563-vote margin from Saturday.
One of them will take over the Arizona Department of Education, currently led by outgoing Superintendent Diane Douglas.
In the race for secretary of state, Democratic State Senator Katie Hobbs leapt into first place briefly on Sunday, before Republican Steve Gaynor took the lead again thanks to the ballots from Pinal County. Gaynor leads Hobbs by just 259 votes.
The Associated Press called the race for Republican Steve Gaynor on the night of the election, though Hobbs has refused to concede.
In the race for the two seats on the Corporation Commission, Democrat Sandra Kennedy held onto her first place spot after recently moving past Republican incumbent Justin Olson. Kennedy, Olson, and third-place Republican Rodney Glassman are separated by approximately 10,000 votes."

","The mayor of a Texas town who told residents he owed them “nothing” as winter storms left millions across the state without power in single digit temperatures has resigned.
“No one owes you [or] your family anything,” Tim Boyd, previously mayor of Colorado City, Texas wrote Tuesday in a Facebook post. “I’m sick and tired of people looking for a damn handout!”
He has since deleted the post.
In a second post, Mr Boyd said he “won’t deny for one minute” anything he said in the previous post, but complained that his wife had faced harassment while adding that he had resigned from his position.
Mr Boyd said he made the comments as a “private citizen,” and that he had resigned his position days earlier. He is still listed as mayor on the city’s website, and city council agendas cite him as mayor as recently as last week, according to The Washington Post.
The former mayor said his wife was fired from her job due to his statement, and complained that his family was subject to “undeserved” harassment and death threats.
The Facebook screed was shared widely on social media and was reported on by numerous news outlets.

In his initial post, Mr Boyd said people waiting in their homes to have their power restored were “lazy” and said that the “strong will survive and the weak will [perish].”
But residents in the region were anything but lazy; residents had banded together to help support each other by walking through the snow to deliver supplies. Others had opened up their private wells to provide water for those who had lost services.
Mr Boyd’s tirade toward people he thinks are “too lazy to get up and fend for themselves” blamed the “socialist government”.
It was not immediately clear which government Mr Boyd was referring to, since he led the local government, and Republicans under Donald Trump ran the country for the last four years.
Texas’ inability to provide uninterrupted utility service to millions of residents is partly due to the state’s decision to operate its own power grid in an effort to avoid federal regulation."

","Most Democrats now identify as liberal rather than moderate or conservative, a Gallup poll released Tuesday found, marking the first time since the polling giant began asking the question in the 1990s.
Monday's poll found that 51 percent of Democrats self-identified as liberal in 2018, up slightly from 50 percent in 2017. The percentage of liberals has sharply climbed in recent years, Gallup noted, with 38 percent identifying as liberal in 2008.
Roughly a third of Democrats -- 34 percent -- identified as moderates in 2018, according to the new poll.

Members of the Republican Party have remained more staunchly conservative, pollsters found, with 73 percent identifying as conservative in 2018 and just 22 percent calling themselves moderate.
At least 70 percent of Republicans have identified as conservative since 2008, according to Gallup.
Monday's poll was based on telephone interviews with 13,852 random adults in 2018. The margin of error is 1 percentage point.

","The former top commander of U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan, retired four-star Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, criticized President Donald Trump's behavior and handling of the presidency, saying the commander-in-chief is dishonest and immoral.
“I don’t think he tells the truth,” McChrystal said in an exclusive interview on “This Week” when asked by Co-Anchor Martha Raddatz if he believes the president is a liar.
“Is Trump immoral, in your view?” Raddatz asked.
“I think he is,” he said.
McChrystal said he couldn't tell any of Trump's supporters ""that they are wrong,"" but added, ""What I would ask every American to do is ... stand in front of that mirror and say, 'What are we about? Am I really willing to throw away or ignore some of the things that people do that are -- are pretty unacceptable normally just because they accomplish certain other things that we might like?'
""If we want to be governed by someone we wouldn't do a business deal with because their -- their background is so shady, if we're willing to do that, then that's in conflict with who I think we are. And so I think it's necessary at those times to take a stand.""
McChrystal, a 34-year veteran of the U.S. Army, served as the head of the Joint Special Operations Command from 2003 to 2008 and later assumed command of all international forces in Afghanistan in June 2009. President Barack Obama relieved McChrystal of that command in June 2010 after Rolling Stone published controversial comments McChrystal made in an interview about the administration. In doing so, Obama still praised the general's ""deep intelligence"" and ""love of the country.""
McChrystal, who recently published a book on leadership styles throughout history called, “Leaders: Myth and Reality,” criticized Trump for not embodying effective leadership.
“The military talks about would they come for you. And what that means is if you're put into a difficult military situation, would that leader sacrifice himself, put himself and others at risk to come for you? I have to believe that the people I'm working for would do that, whether we disagree on a lot of other things. I'm not convinced from the behavior that I've seen that that's the case here,” said McChrystal.
He also cautioned anyone who might fill the vacancy left by Defense Secretary James Mattis’ departure, to consider if their values sufficiently align with those of the president.
""I think maybe it causes the American people to take pause and say, wait a minute, if we have someone who is as selfless and as committed as Jim Mattis resign his position, walking away from all the responsibility he feels for every service member in our forces and he does so in a public way like that, we ought to stop and say, 'OK, why did he do it?,'"" McChrystal said on ""This Week.""
“I would ask [potential candidates] to look in the mirror and ask them if they can get comfortable enough with President Trump's approach to governance, how he conducts himself with his values and with his worldview to be truly loyal to him as a commander in chief and going forward,” McChrystal said. “If there's too much of a disconnect then I would tell him I think it’s -- it would be a bad foundation upon which to try to build a successful partnership at that job.”
McChrystal said he would not take a job in the Trump administration if he were asked.
""I think it's important for me to work for people who I think are basically honest, who tell the truth as best they know it,"" he said. ""I'm very tolerant of people who make mistakes because I make so many of them -- and I've been around leaders who've made mistakes ... but through all of them, I almost never saw people trying to get it wrong. And I almost never saw people who were openly disingenuous on things.""
He also disagreed with Trump’s approach to his visit to Iraq last week to address troops, saying the president was wrong to politicize a usually non-political occasion. In addition to talking extensively about domestic political issues in his speech to troops, Trump autographed troops' “Make America Great Again” hats. The president said in a tweet that the hats were not provided by the White House.
McChrystal said he understood why many young troops would want signed memorabilia from the president, comparing it to meeting a celebrity, but also warned that it “violated the spirit” of the military code and that the military’s apolitical status should be preserved.
“If we encourage young military members to be Republicans or Democrats or anything particular, you start to create schisms in an infantry platoon,” McChrystal told Raddatz on ""This Week.""
“I never knew who was a Democrat or Republican and even when we were generals, when you got in a room, you never talked about politics because it was just considered bad form,"" he said. ""I think if we allow it or encourage it, I think we are going to create something that could be a slippery slope.”
McChrystal also disagreed with Trump's announcement to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, warning it would lead to ""greater instability"" in the Middle East.
""What difference does it make -- does it really make, if those 2,000 U.S. forces leave?"" Raddatz asked.
“If you pull American influence out, you're likely to have greater instability and of course it'll be much more difficult for the United States to try to push events in any direction. There is an argument that says we just pull up our stuff, go home, let the region run itself. That has not done well for the last 50 or 60 years,” McChrystal said.
In announcing the withdrawal from Syria earlier this month, Trump touted victory over the Islamic State, or ISIS, there, declaring, “We have defeated ISIS in Syria.”
McChrystal disagreed, citing the continued threat of ISIS’ ideology.
“I don't believe ISIS is defeated,” McChrystal said. “I think ISIS is as much an idea as it is a number of ISIS fighters. There's a lot of intelligence that says there are actually more ISIS fighters around the world now than there were a couple of years ago.”
ABC News has also reported that Trump plans to reduce U.S. forces in Afghanistan by half, about 7,000 troops. In a statement to Bloomberg Friday, Garrett Marquis, a spokesperson for the National Security Council said Trump ""has not made a determination to"" to withdraw troops from Afghanistan or ""directed the Department of Defense to begin the process of withdrawing"" troops. Marquis did not respond when ABC News requested further comment.
""Do you see that as a problem?"" Raddatz asked McChrystal.
“I think the great mistake in the president's leaked guidance is that just when we were starting to sit down with the Taliban, just we were starting to begin negotiations, he basically traded away the biggest leverage point we have. If you tell the Taliban that we are absolutely leaving on a date ... their incentives to try to cut a deal dropped dramatically,” McChrystal said.
McChrystal added that the decision could have a lasting impact on the trust in the alliance between the United States and the democratically-elected Afghan government it supports.
“Of course I was worried about the confidence of the Afghan people because at the end of the day, that's what determines who wins in Afghanistan,” McChrystal said. “And I think we probably rocked them -- we rocked them in their belief that we are allies that can be counted on.”"

","The public hearing is one of three sessions Mr. Cohen will have next week on Capitol Hill. He is also scheduled to participate in private deposition-style interviews with the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, where he is likely to be pressed on matters pertaining to Russia and other potential efforts by foreign powers to gain influence over Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to the two intelligence committees about the Trump Organization proposal to build a skyscraper in Moscow.
Before that, in August, Mr. Cohen had pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to tax fraud, making false statements to a bank and the campaign finance violation. He said in court at the time that the last violation was the result of payments he made at Mr. Trump’s behest during the 2016 campaign to two women to keep them from speaking publicly about affairs they said they had with Mr. Trump.
Mr. Cohen had been expected to report early next month to begin serving a three-year prison sentence, but on Wednesday, a federal judge in Manhattan said that he could delay that appearance by two months, to May 6. In requesting the delay, Mr. Cohen’s lawyers said he had undergone recent shoulder surgery and needed to take part in physical therapy.
If Democrats are hoping that Mr. Cohen’s testimony will damage Mr. Trump’s public image, Republicans have been laying the groundwork to try to undercut Mr. Cohen’s credibility first. In a letter to Mr. Cummings on Tuesday, the oversight committee’s top Republicans referred to Mr. Cohen as “an admitted serial liar” and accused the Democrats of putting on a political show.
“When Cohen appears before our committee, we can only assume that he will continue his pattern of deceit and perjury,” the Republicans, Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows of North Carolina, wrote. “Although Cohen falsely attributes his crimes to ‘blind loyalty to Donald Trump,’ a federal judge correctly noted that Cohen’s crimes were all motivated by his personal greed and ambition.”
Mr. Trump himself has repeatedly suggested that Mr. Cohen lied to prosecutors about him to reduce his own prison sentence. Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s lawyer, abruptly shifted his own assessment of Mr. Cohen’s honesty after Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty and began talking to prosecutors."

""That is not the graphic we are looking for. Hold off,"" the Fox News host protested before pleading, ""Take that down, please.""

Kurtz denied Monday in a Facebook post that he ""somehow panicked or didn’t want to show the poll graphic."" He said the graphic had been taken down because it was shown at the wrong time.
""During the segment, the control room mistakenly posted the graphic early, while I was dealing with the fake news questions. So I calmly asked that it be taken down.

The in-person discussion, filmed last week at the Obama Foundation’s office in Washington, D.C. features both Obama and Biden clad in black face masks as they arrive for the conversation, as the two discuss their incredulity at President Donald Trump's handling of coronavirus.
""Can you imagine standing up when you were president and saying, ‘It's not my responsibility. I take no responsibility.' Literally. Literally,"" Biden said.
""Those words didn't come out of our mouths when we were in office,"" Obama said as the shot of him exiting his car is seen.
""No. I don't understand his inability to get a sense of what people are going through,"" Biden said. ""He can't relate in any way.""
Without mentioning him by name, President Obama took aim at his successor’s handling of the current coronavirus pandemic while expressing his optimism that his former vice president could help the country recover if elected.
“I have confidence that you're going to actually listen to the experts. And you're going to pay attention to the science, and you're not going to quit on trying to actually bend down the curve of disease and transmission rates,” Obama told Biden.
The pair also discussed their administration’s signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), lamenting the president’s attempts to do away with the law during the coronavirus pandemic, and defending their work as a starting point for health care coverage in the United States.
“It's like a starter house. It's the first house you get and it's not the end of the process it's the beginning of the process,” Obama said of the ACA.
“Remember what I used to say? It's like Social Security when it's first passed,” Biden added, noting the expansion of the program over time.
The images are the first of the two men appearing together in person during the 2020 campaign, and come months after Obama formally endorsed Biden in April.
The two men also discussed the current protests and push for racial equality and the Black Lives Matter movement, which both men agreed is largely fueled by a younger generation no longer willing to accept the status quo.
“What we have seen is this extraordinary mobilization across the country of people of every walk of life, every race, every creed who say we're past time to do something about this we understand we're not going to fix it all in one day. But we're going to take this seriously and we're going to start now,” Obama said, noting that both his daughters and Biden’s granddaughters have participated in the recent push for change.
“Policy is important, laws are important, budgets are important, but you know what's important also is what kind of values are you communicating?” Obama added, expressing his confidence that Biden’s agenda will address all of the root causes of systemic racism, not just those reflected in the way America polices its citizens.
Biden, as he has throughout the entirety of his presidential bid, decried President Trump as a leader disinterested in addressing racial inequality, and who instead chooses to divide Americans to benefit his political standing.
“This guy has generated a sense out there that people are waking up to it. He ran by deliberately dividing people from the moment he came down that escalator. And I think people are now going, ‘I don't want my kid growing up that way,’” Biden said of his Republican rival.
Obama consistently praised Biden as an “effective” vice president that is able to relate to the struggles facing American families.
“If you can sit down with a family, and see your own family and the struggles that you've gone through, parents went through or your kids are going through. If you can connect those struggles to somebody else's struggles, then you're going to work hard for it. And that's always what's motivated you to get into public service,” Obama told Biden.
The former president pledged to support Biden’s candidacy and added that he looks forward to helping out the man he worked so closely with for eight years.
“I'm looking forward to working with you to do whatever I can to help. And I have confidence in your commitment to making sure that we seize this moment that we have right now,” Obama told Biden.
“Thank you, and I have faith in the American people,” Biden responded.
The Biden campaign also used the video as a chance to beef up voter files, asking those interested in the video to text the campaign to be notified when the video goes live.
On Twitter alone, the two reached nearly 128 million followers when sharing the conversation, with nearly 121 million of those belonging to Obama. According to the Biden’s campaign’s Digital Director Rob Flaherty, a video previewing the conversation received more than 10 million views across social media platforms Wednesday.
While Obama remained on the sidelines during the Democratic primary race, he has reemerged to offer his support to the man who served alongside him for eight years. Most recently, the two paired up for a grassroots fundraiser in late June that featured a lengthy and wide-ranging conversation.
The event was also Biden’s most successful money event to date, raising more than $11 million.
The new video featuring their chat also comes as Obama is set to participate in his second fundraiser on behalf of the Biden campaign next week.
According to an invitation to the event, obtained by ABC News, Obama will participate in a “virtual conversation” next Tuesday to raise money for Biden’s campaign, which has begun to steadily close the money gap with Trump’s reelection juggernaut.
An aide to the former president said that while the bulk of Obama’s campaigning, both on the presidential level and down the ballot, is expected to happen after Labor Day, the video with Biden was a way to take advantage of the chemistry between the two men in a way that still modeled best behaviors to stop the spread of COVID-19, which continues to rage in many state across the country.
“[The] video is an example of our effort to bring together two beloved and respected leaders to discuss the pressing issues of our time and how Joe Biden will tackle them. We wanted to find a way to tap into the chemistry between the two principals but consistent with all social distancing protocols in order to model best practices,” Eric Schultz, a senior advisor to President Obama, told ABC News.
As Biden continues to roll out his economic agenda, he has kept the coronavirus, and what he argues is the president’s management of the crisis, at the heart of his argument for why Trump does not deserve a second term.
In a speech in New Castle, Delaware, on Tuesday, Biden assailed Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, casting him as a leader indifferent to the ongoing struggles the virus presents to the public health and American economy.
“For all [Trump’s] bluster about his expertise on the economy, he's unable to explain how he'll actually help the working families hit the hardest,” Biden said. “He's quit on you and he’s quit on this country.”

","Senator Bernie Sanders has threatened to shut down the US government next week and keep lawmakers in Washington through Christmas unless they submit to his demand for another round of $1,200 stimulus checks for most Americans.
“We're not going to go home for the Christmas holidays unless we provide for the millions of families in this country who are suffering,” the Vermont Independent senator said in a speech on the Senate floor on Friday.
Mr Sanders said it was not like him to use government funding deadlines as leverage to push certain policy priorities, and he stood aside on Friday to allow negotiators another week to work out the details of an all-inclusive fiscal year 2021 appropriations package.
“I’m not one of the members of the Senate who shuts down, does this, or does that, and keeps you here for the weekend. I don't do that,” Mr Sanders said.
But with the coronavirus pandemic raging as strongly as ever, he is willing to take government funding to the brink next week if it will help him secure more direct payments for Americans.
“This I want to say right now: I am prepared to withdraw my objection at this moment. But I will not be prepared to withdraw an objection next week,” he said.
Mr Sanders, a generational progressive icon who nearly won the Democratic presidential nomination two cycles in a row, is not the only senator aggressively pushing the $1,200 stimulus check proposal.

✕ Bernie Sanders says proposed $600 stimulus checks are 'c**p'
The other is Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley, a rising star in conservative circles who unflinchingly supports Donald Trump and is reportedly gearing up for a run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.
The odd couple has teamed up on an amendment to the must-pass government spending bill calling for the Treasury Department to mail out another round of $1,200 stimulus checks to most American adults as part of the next congressional Covid relief package.
As of early Friday afternoon, Mr Sanders was still threatening to delay a vote on the stopgap government appropriations bill, known as a “continuing resolution” (or “CR” in Washington-speak), that will allow lawmakers another week to negotiate a long-term government spending outlay for FY21.
Funding for the US government is set to expire at midnight on Friday. Donald Trump is expected to sign the stopgap funding measure before then.
Mr Sanders had been using Friday’s deadline as leverage to demand that his and Mr Hawley’s amendment receive a vote. He has not been given any such guarantees as of yet, and the two senators can redeploy the same tactic next Friday when the government is on the precipice of shutting down.
“Let’s see what happens,” the Vermont senator told reporters on Capitol Hill on Friday morning, urging them to have “patience” as his negotiating tactic played out.
Like Mr Sanders, most Democrats in Washington want to move forward with another round of $1,200 direct payments to most American taxpayers in the mould of a programme from the $2.2trn CARES Act from March that cost the US Treasury hundreds of billions of dollars.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she would like to see another round of stimulus checks in the next Covid package that has eluded negotiators for months. But a group of moderate senators from both parties who have been negotiating over the last week on a middle-of-the-road Covid deal have not included the stimulus check programme in their latest proposals.
Mr Hawley’s support for re-upping the $1,200 stimulus check programme bucks his party establishment’s more austere approach to Covid relief.
The Trump administration has floated the possibility of $600 checks.
Senate Republicans, most of whom are even more wary of a ballooning budget than the outgoing GOP White House, are all over the map on stimulus checks, with some lending support in recent weeks for another round of them, but others throwing cold water on the proposal."
demsocialist,"https://abcnews.go.com/US/capitol-siege-majority-americans-trump-removed-office-term/story?id=75154331
","A majority of the country believes President Donald Trump should be removed before President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20 and two-thirds hold him accountable for the violent insurrection on Capitol Hill, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll released Sunday.
In the new survey, which was conducted by Ipsos in partnership with ABC News using Ipsos' Knowledge Panel, 56% of Americans think the sitting commander-in-chief should be removed from office before the official transfer of power in less than two weeks, while 43% say he should not. Among those who say Trump should not be removed immediately, nearly half (45%) nevertheless say his actions this week were wrong.
Ousting the current president before his term expires splits Americans along partisan lines, with 94% of Democrats and only 13% of Republicans supporting the move. A majority of independents -- 58% -- also back removing him.
The end of Trump's turbulent tenure has been marred by chaos. Earlier this week, throngs of pro-Trump loyalists, spurred by the outgoing president at his ""Save America Rally,"" besieged the U.S. Capitol complex -- overpowering police blockades, breaking windows and ransacking the halls and offices.
In the aftermath of the riot on Capitol Hill, Trump is facing pressure to resign, even from within his own ranks -- as sources tell ABC News that his Cabinet and allies have discussed invoking the 25th Amendment, although it's unclear how extensive these conversations have been or whether Vice President Mike Pence supports such action.
Trump is also on the brink of being impeached for a second time as House Democrats ready impeachment charges that are expected to be introduced early this week.
At least one Senate Republican, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, said she wants Trump ""out"" in an interview with The Anchorage Daily News, and Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Pat Toomey told Fox News this weekend that he thinks Trump ""committed impeachable offenses,"" before adding, ""I don't know what is going to land on the Senate floor."" Neither have endorsed the possibility of impeachment proceedings, yet.
Sixty-seven percent of Americans lay blame squarely at Trump's feet for the Wednesday riot and the unprecedented breach that led to the death of five, including a Capitol police officer who succumbed to injuries suffered during the attack. This includes 52% who believe he shoulders a great deal of the responsibility. Only 15% of those polled say that he bears none of the blame.
The assault on the Capitol came as a joint session of Congress was formalizing Biden's Electoral College victory, which the president has assailed and challenged with unfounded claims of fraud over the last two months. More than two-thirds of Americans are not in agreement with the president, saying they believe Biden's victory was legitimate. Still, among those still refusing to accept Trump's loss nearly 3 in 4 are Republicans (73%). Meanwhile, overwhelming majorities of Democrats (99%) and independents (75%) think Biden's victory was legitimate.
The poll also asked who among a range of prominent political figures -- such as Pence and Utah Sen. Mitt Romney -- Americans trust to safeguard democracy.
With Biden set to take the helm in the White House in 10 days, after four years of a presidency animated by deep divisions, he is the only one with majority support on that question (53%). Still, reflecting the political chasm he will seek to overcome, there are divisions in how much Democrats (94%) and Republicans (14%) trust the incoming president to protect democracy.
Overall, Biden fares far better than Trump and congressional Republicans, with only 30% saying they trust the president to defend democracy and 31% saying the same of Republicans in Congress.
For Pence, who landed in the center of Trump's crosshairs for rejecting his efforts to subvert the electoral process, there is slightly more confidence in him than the president when it comes to safeguarding democracy. After Trump relentlessly pressured an unabiding Pence to use his ceremonial role presiding over Congress' counting of electoral votes to hand the president a victory, nearly 4 in 10 Americans (39%) say they trust the vice president with protecting democracy.
One of the least-trusted figures is Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who helped spearhead a failed effort to contest electoral votes in a slate of battleground states, including Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania. An overwhelming 71% of Americans say they don't trust him to defend democracy, including 47% who don't trust him at all.
For Romney, the Utah senator who harshly rebuffed the efforts by Cruz and a handful of other senators to try to derail Biden's win, 41% trust him to preserve democracy.
Among Republican respondents, Pence performs best, with 73% trusting him, compared to 71% for Trump, 57% for Cruz, 38% for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and only 25% for Romney. In a surprising turn, more than twice as many Democrats -- 55% -- put their faith in Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee.
Congressional leaders in both parties also face a trust deficit among Americans. McConnell ranks the lowest of all the individuals included in the survey question about shielding American democracy at 22%. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trusted by almost twice as many Americans as McConnell, with 40%.
Between congressional Democrats and Republicans, more Democrats say they trust the members who represent them in the House and Senate than Republicans. Nearly 9 in 10 Democrats (89%) believe in congressional Democrats to protect democracy, while 71% of Republicans say the same about members of the GOP in Congress.
The Supreme Court is most trusted with 60% saying they have a great deal or good amount of trust in the highest court in the land to protect democracy.

","The publisher of conservative online magazine The Federalist broke federal labor laws when he tweeted last year that he’d send employees “back to the salt mine” if they tried to unionize, a National Labor Relations Board administrative judge decided.
FDRLST Media chief Ben Domenech’s tweet was an “obvious threat""—not a joke or an expression of opinion shielded by the First Amendment—when viewed in light of workers’ legally protected rights, Judge Kenneth Chu said Wednesday. The timing of the tweet, which came on the same day of a walkout by union employees at Vox Media, supported the conclusion that Domenech was sending a message to employees, the judge held.
“Obviously, the FDRLST employees are not literally being sent back to the salt mines,” Chu wrote. “Idioms have, however, hidden meanings.”
The company will have to post physical notices in its offices and send email copies to employees, alerting them that FDRLST Media violated federal labor law and advising employees of their right to organize. That’s a standard remedy for relatively minor violations of the National Labor Relations Act.
The decision is one of several recent rulings from the agency finding businesses or executives liable for violating labor laws via Twitter, often by threatening some kind of consequence for employee organizing. Barstool Sports recently deleted an anti-union tweet by founder David Portnoy as part of its settlement of a labor board complaint. The agency has also cited Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk for his use of the social media platform.
The charge against the magazine was filed by Joel Fleming, an attorney in Massachusetts who doesn’t work for the Federalist. The NLRB generally permits members of the public to file charges alleging labor violations at companies.
FDRLST Media plans to appeal the decision, according to attorneys with the New Civil Liberties Alliance who are representing the company. They argue that Fleming shouldn’t have been permitted to file the charge.
“The main issue is not really the tweet per se or the underlying charge,” attorney Adi Dynar told Bloomberg Law Thursday. “It’s that a random person on the internet should not be abusing the administrative machinery for some personal motives.”
The company also argued that the tweet was a sarcastic joke, pointing to affidavits from two employees. Chu found that the context of the message, and the history of the term—referring to physically challenging, tedious work—suggest otherwise.
“In viewing the totality of the circumstances surrounding the tweet, this tweet had no other purpose except to threaten the FDRLST employees with unspecified reprisal, as the underlying meaning of ‘salt mine’ so signifies,” Chu said.
Fleming cheered the decision.
“I am pleased that the decision reaffirms the important principle that employers are not allowed to threaten their employees with reprisals for supporting a union or engaging in concerted activities,” Fleming told Bloomberg Law Wednesday.
Domenech won’t be required to delete the tweet."

","This past Saturday, I was exposed as a sex worker who is also a New York City paramedic. The New York Post published a story shaming me for selling my nude photos online and made sure to include my full name, photos of me, my education, my height and weight, my location, and my workplace.
The article goes into detail about the content of my OnlyFans page, a subscription website for creators to sell content and what I used to sell my photos. They go on to quote an anonymous FDNY veteran who said, “Other EMTs and paramedics make more money by pulling extra shifts, instead of pulling off their clothes.”
Here’s the truth about me. I am 23 years old and from a small town in West Virginia. My mother’s family is from northern West Virginia and my father’s parents were immigrants from China. I am the eldest of four children and our family was one of the only mixed-race families in my predominately white town.
I graduated from Winfield High School in a class of 200, the largest at the time. During high school, I was active in show choir, GSA, NHS, and dance classes. I moved to New York City when I was 18 to pursue my lifelong dream of being on Broadway. I completed AMDA, started auditioning, and then decided it wasn’t for me anymore. So I became an EMT.
I worked as an EMT for a year then I quit because I couldn’t put myself through paramedic school on minimum wage. I went back to hosting at a restaurant to make ends meet while I worked a year through paramedic school, one of the most challenging things I have ever done. I graduated paramedic school in February of 2020 and dove right into working, just as the Covid-19 pandemic hit.
I was not prepared for all that I was about to see. New York City was hit the hardest between April and June, when it became the global epicentre of the virus, with over 22,000 deaths by the start of July. I work as a transport paramedic where my typical calls are to take patients from nursing homes to their various doctors’ appointments. With Covid, my transports were more often taking extremely sick patients from one hospital to another.
I transported a 40-year-old physician’s assistant who was intubated, on a ventilator, with three IV drips running, and still trying to rip his own tube out. The nurses on the floor said to me, “This is one of our own.” That particular patient reminded me of my father, who is also a healthcare worker, and I still remember choking up.

I also trained with community paramedics, who made house calls to high-risk patients in an attempt to treat them without having to go to the ER and expose them to other sick patients. There were several times where we were in Covid-positive patients’ homes for three to four hours in full PPE, waiting to speak with the doctor over the phone for orders. In some cases, these patients still had to be transported to the ER and their family members were not permitted in the ambulance or in the hospitals. I took many patients away from their loved ones and saw how they looked at each other, not knowing if they would ever see one another alive again.
I held the hands of dying people who could not hold the hands of their spouses, children, siblings, and friends. I listened to the president of the United States say on TV that all the hospitals and healthcare workers had everything they needed, while I was using a weeks-old N95 mask and waiting for a ventilator the hospital didn’t have for my patient. And at the end of every day, I came home to an empty apartment where I cried about the state of our world while sanitising my equipment.
The New York City 911 system was overwhelmed by the call volume during the height of the pandemic. On a regular day, NYC 911 EMS will have around 4,000 calls. My 911 brothers and sisters battled through months of close to 7,000 calls a day. They were forced to make critical decisions, like who was sick enough to be taken to the ER or who was too far gone to benefit from CPR. They had a 20-minute limit on working a patient up before pronouncing them dead. Many of these EMTs and paramedics have more than one job and work over 50 hours a week to support their families. I’ve seen people work 16 hours in a row at one job, then go work another eight hours at another out of necessity. Starting EMTs get paid $15 an hour and EMS workers are the worst-paid first responders in New York City.
The loneliness and helplessness I felt during this time was often overwhelming. My family lives 500 miles away from me in a state with local politicians who constantly downplayed the pandemic and I worried about them every day. I was watching the people of my city die in front of my eyes and there was absolutely nothing I could do except be present for them. Many nights, I felt like I’d rather just not be here at all.
But I also got to see the best parts of New York City. I heard every 7pm applause from every resident who could spare some pots and pans to show their love for healthcare workers. Restaurants that were struggling themselves gave free meals to hospital staff daily. Eventually, I had the pleasure of taking patients who were hospitalised for weeks back home to their families. Many EMS workers had much harder experiences than mine.
This is the reality behind the New York Post article about me, one which has now gone viral. Little did the reporters involved know that they would give me the opportunity to speak out about the things that mean most to me. How I make my money in order to help those in need is nobody’s business but my own, and certainly no patient has asked if I’m on OnlyFans before allowing me to help them."

","Bernie Sanders has rejected accusations he is unable to turn his policies into action, responding to claims he “fails” to get things done by listing his political achievements for two minutes.
During a CNN interview on Monday, presenter Anderson Cooper challenged the veteran Vermont senator to respond to criticism from his Democratic presidential rival Elizabeth Warren.
Mr Sanders is “a senator who has good ideas but whose 30-year track record shows he consistently calls for things he fails to get done and consistently opposes things he nevertheless fails to stop,” Ms Warren said last week during a campaign event in Houston.
Mr Sanders said he “would respectfully disagree with Senator Warren” before launching into a list that he claimed proved her wrong.
He pointed to Amazon and Disney raising workers’ wages after he called for a minimum wage of $15 (£12) an hour, a rate that seven US states have also now adopted — although some Sanders campaign staffers have complained they earn less.

Mr Sanders added he had helped pass ”the most significant veterans’ bill” of recent history, put $11bn (£8.6bn) for community health centres into the Affordable Care Act, and force the US to end its involvement in the war in Yemen.
He suggested his calls for free university tuition had instigated “states, cities, counties moving in exactly that direction”, and claimed his focus on the climate emergency during the 2016 Democratic primaries had helped put the issue on the map.

","After disappointing results in the first three contests — Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada -- Warren has been managing expectations about how she will perform at home on Tuesday.
""Look, I'm out here making my case to everybody all across the nation and I'm so deeply grateful to the people in my home state who helped me beat an incumbent Republican back in 2012,"" Warren said, when asked if she could guarantee she'll win her home state during an interview with CBS News after this week’s Democratic debate.
When pressed for an answer about winning Massachusetts, she did not say yes.
It's not clear whether Warren will campaign in Massachusetts in the run-up to the primary. But her campaign recently released a list of 147 endorsements from local elected officials, and has held dozens of events in recent weeks with Massachusetts surrogates including Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu, and other city councilors and state lawmakers.
Warren also received an endorsement from the Boston Globe editorial board earlier this week — the very hometown paper which had urged her in 2018 not to run for president.
But on Thursday, Sanders received the endorsement of the Daily Hampshire Gazette, a small paper in Western Massachusetts that backed him in 2016. Warren won Northampton, where the Gazette is located, by a landslide in her 2018 reelection bid with 86 percent of the vote. It was one of her best performances in the state, behind the Boston-area cities of Cambridge, where she got 90 percent of the vote, and Somerville, where she received 87 percent.
Sensing an opportunity to deal a serious blow here to his top progressive rival, Sanders has events planned across the state in the final days before the primary, starting with the Worcester festival his campaign has taken to calling “Berniepalooza.” He will hold a rally in Springfield on Friday, the largest city in Western Massachusetts, followed by a rally on the Boston Common on Saturday.
Sanders carried the western part of the state in the 2016 primary, but lost to Hillary Clinton in Boston and many of its surrounding suburbs. Clinton won narrowly statewide, 51%-49%, to win 46 of the state’s 91 delegates.
""The purpose of doing this is for the press and generating excitement. They're not convincing any more voters at this stage of the game,"" said a former Sanders staffer who worked on his Massachusetts campaign in 2016. ""This is a way to stay in two media markets all weekend long.""
Earlier this week, Sanders released a new television ad in the state that features President John F. Kennedy's famous speech about the moon landing. It's an indirect dig at Warren, who occupies the Senate seat previously held by JFK and his brother, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. She also counts Rep. Joe Kennedy III as a surrogate, who campaigned for her in Cambridge several days ago.
And Sanders sought to drum up some goodwill among Boston activists on Thursday evening, tweeting in support of more affordable housing ""instead of more gentrifying luxury developments for the few"" in East Boston, where the city is considering plans to redevelop the site of a former racetrack.
Still, nothing telegraphs Sanders’ strategy like the four-day festival planned for central Massachusetts, a clear play to drum up support among his strongest demographic — young voters. An event page for the ""first of its kind"" festival boasts that it is so popular that the campaign can't provide accommodations for all the volunteers.
""WE ARE FRESH OUT OF SUPPORTER HOUSING - at this point you'll have to make your own accommodations!"" the page says.
The Worcester festival is located in a city experiencing a development boom that includes importing a minor league baseball team, and an influx of breweries, artisanal bakeries and speakeasy-style bars in the city's suburbs. That has attracted young people and families who tend to be more liberal, said state Rep. Jim O'Day who represents the area, and even the once-reliably red surrounding county is becoming more purple.
""If you look at where a lot of the newer folks moving into the area are coming from, you'd see they are emanating from the Boston area. The progressiveness of Boston, I think a little bit, is actually spreading out towards the western parts of the state,"" O'Day said. ""Worcester is a strong Democratic city with lots of activism going on there.""

Worcester also has a lot of young people — the city contains nine colleges and universities, which serve around 36,000 students. The city is around 69 percent white, but it has a growing Latino population. Around 21 percent of city residents are Hispanic or Latino, according to census data, and 13 percent of Worcester residents are black. In the Worcester public school system, a plurality of students are Latino.
""There's certainly a core group of folks in Worcester that are working hard for him,"" said O'Day, who has not endorsed a candidate.
Despite Sanders’ efforts on Warren’s home turf, Charlie Baker, a political strategist at Dewey Square Group in Boston, dismissed the prospect of Sanders sweeping Massachusetts. Baker supports Warren, but is not working for the campaign.
""I assume she will win Massachusetts, but the way you win the presidential nomination is you get more delegates, you get a majority of the delegates. So they're running a campaign based on the idea of trying to get more delegates, which makes sense to me,"" Baker said. ""She's got a reservoir full of support and I think that unless something strange happens, you know, she could win.""
Even if Sanders defeats Warren by a small margin, Baker said, the Massachusetts primary won't have much bearing on Warren's delegate math heading toward the convention.
Baker points to 2016, when Sanders lost Massachusetts by a small margin and only took one fewer delegate than Clinton.
""At the end of the day, if this is about delegates, it probably won’t matter,"" Baker said. ""If he gets 22 percent and she gets 21 percent, it's the same answer."""

","Rep. Joe Crowley, one of the top Democrats in the House of Representatives, lost his New York primary in a shocking upset on Tuesday night to community organizer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Crowley, having fundraised nearly $3 million for the race in New York’s 14th District, fell easily to a first-time candidate with a viral introduction video, a Democratic Socialists of America membership card, and a proudly leftist agenda. She ran on Medicare-for-all, a federal jobs guarantee, and getting tough on Wall Street. The race was called just before 10 pm for Ocasio-Cortez.
For those who closely watch elections, this is the biggest primary upset since David Brat defeated then-majority leader Eric Cantor in 2014. Brat ran on a campaign of depicting Cantor as a creature of Washington rather than a true representative of the district.
Likewise, Crowley, who has been in Congress since 1999, is the No. 4 Democrat in the House and was widely viewed as an eventual successor to minority leader Nancy Pelosi. Though he was a stalwart progressive on nearly every issue, he also had close ties to Wall Street. This made him a formidable fundraiser, something Ocasio-Cortez turned against Crowley in the primary. She eventually fundraised about $600,000 through small-dollar donors.
The district, which spans parts of the Bronx and Queens, is heavily Democratic, so Ocasio-Cortez is all but guaranteed to be a new member of Congress in November.
Who is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?
At 28, Ocasio-Cortez couldn’t be a bigger contrast from 56-year-old Crowley. She was born in the Bronx to working-class parents. Her mother is Puerto Rican. Her father is from the South Bronx. She’s a former staffer for the late Sen. Ted Kennedy.
She’s certainly portrayed herself as a woman of the people, playing up her working-class roots in a viral introduction video, which shows Ocasio-Cortez riding the subway and doing community organizing work. It was created by Means of Production, a media production company run by DSA activists Naomi Burton and Nick Hayes.
It's time for a New York that works for all of us.
On June 26th, we can make it happen - but only if we have the #CourageToChange.
It's time to get to work. Please retweet this video and sign up to knock doors + more at https://t.co/kacKFI9RtI to bring our movement to Congress. pic.twitter.com/aqKMjovEjZ — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) May 30, 2018
What was most exciting for progressives is the degree to which Ocasio-Cortez ran to Crowley’s left. As a member of the DSA, her website is a laundry list of every blue-sky progressive policy: Medicare-for-all, housing and jobs guarantees, gun control, ending private prisons, abolishing ICE, and investment in post-hurricane Puerto Rico.
She had some help from a major Crowley misstep — he sent a surrogate to a primary debate, which led to a scathing editorial from the New York Times. “This is the second primary debate in which Mr. Crowley was a no-show. A spokeswoman for Mr. Crowley said he had scheduling conflicts that wouldn’t allow him to attend the two debates, inevitably leaving voters to wonder — what are we, chopped liver?” the editorial read.
What does this mean for the Democratic Party?
Ocasio-Cortez’s victory is a story of the complacent establishment taking voters for granted. It’s the story of how the Democratic Party is getting pulled to the left. It’s also about how it’s not just progressive policies that are reshaping the party, but also people of color.
Ocasio-Cortez ran decidedly to the left of Crowley, but she also shook up how Democrats go about getting elected. Until now, Democrats have seen big money in politics as simply a deal with the devil that had to be made. Democrats are so often outspent by Republican mega-donors that they viewed courting big-dollar donors and corporations as part of creating a level playing field.
But if one of Democrats’ top fundraisers and likely successor to Nancy Pelosi can be toppled, perhaps Democrats need to rethink that deal."

","Both in tactics and rhetoric, there are growing signs he takes his rival very seriously — and that he increasingly views Sanders as his most formidable opponent in Iowa and beyond.
The Biden campaign has specifically courted the endorsement of community leaders in Iowa who backed Sanders in 2016. They’ve sought to combat Sanders’ recent habit of rolling out star surrogates like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with their own A-list surrogates. And last week, Biden’s five-day Iowa bus tour heavily concentrated on the eastern part of the state — the biggest regional battleground between the two candidates because of its concentration of working-class voters.
“They have to start forcing Bernie to address some of his obvious challenges,” said Simon Rosenberg, founder of the New Democrat Network and a senior strategist for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2018. “The gloves-off strategy didn’t work for Clinton, and it isn’t going to work this time either.”
In 2016, Hillary Clinton was criticized for underestimating Sanders — something she denied at the time – and assuming she’d steamroll her way to the nomination. Instead, she endured a protracted primary that left Sanders supporters embittered and unenthusiastic in the general election. Clinton barely edged out Sanders here by three-tenths of a percentage point, 49.9 percent to 49.6 percent, in a contentious election that left long-lasting scars.
While a crowded primary field means the dynamics are considerably different this year, Biden campaign advisers still acknowledge Sanders presents a formidable challenge. He began the 2020 contest in Iowa with a deep and loyal following — and a base that’s clamoring for a rematch with an establishment candidate. Biden aides say they respect the level of excitement and loyalty from Sanders backers and recognize the threat that the Vermont senator’s fundraising juggernaut presents.
“What is the lesson from 2016? It’s to not underestimate Bernie Sanders and his supporters,” said Biden senior adviser Anita Dunn. “It’s a strong, broad base of support. And he is an indefatigable candidate.”
While the two candidates represent different wings of the party, polling data suggests another reason for concern: Sanders, more than any other top tier candidate, comes closest to rivaling Biden’s appeal to minority voters and working class voters.
“I never would underestimate Bernie,” said Randy Black, Cerro Gordo County Democratic Party vice chair, who has not endorsed a candidate yet. “He’s more than ever a threat.”
Since the start of the year, Biden has sharpened his messaging to highlight the distinctions, dedicating a bigger portion of his stump speech toward making the case that he is the candidate best-suited to work with Republicans and heal a divided country — something the campaign says draws a sharp contrast with both Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
As Biden hits his stride in Iowa, that theme represents a big part of his closing argument. As part of the case for his electability, he asserts that he, more than any other candidate, can help win back the Senate by providing a top of the ticket boost in places like North Carolina, Arizona and Texas — states where there are questions about whether a candidate as liberal as Sanders would be an asset to the eventual Democratic Senate nominee.
“We think it is a clear point of difference with the approach of some of the other major candidates and one that is authentic to Biden and his record,” Dunn said.
Biden has recently sought to counter Sanders’ practice of rolling out star surrogates like Ocasio-Cortez, who drew massive crowds in the state in November and electrified Sanders’ supporters. Her tour through Iowa drew more than 2,000 people at each of the events.
Biden’s relatively staid endorsement events here couldn’t be more different from the razzle dazzle rallies showcasing Ocasio-Cortez. But they’ve featured political heavyweights designed to highlight Biden’s messaging about his experience and electability.
Former Secretary of State John Kerry — who won the Iowa caucuses en route to the 2004 Democratic nomination — was the headliner among a group of Democratic officeholders who embarked on a ""We Know Joe"" bus tour this week.
Former Gov. and ex-Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack and his wife Christie, recently toured with Biden through rural Iowa in small, intimate venues. Rep. Abby Finkenauer — a rising Democratic star in the state — campaigned with Biden in mid-size events, the largest bringing about 700 people.
Biden advisers and surrogates have framed the endorsements as clear markers of the differences between Sanders and Biden, with Ocasio-Cortez representing the left flank of the party and Finkenauer representing the mainstream — she knocked off a Republican incumbent in a Northeast Iowa-based swing district, the kind of place that the Democratic nominee will need to defeat Donald Trump in November.
“Ms. Ocasio-Cortez represents a district in New York, so she’s probably reflective of the values of the people in that district in New York,” said Rep. Ami Bera of California, who is among the surrogates traveling through the state on Biden’s behalf this week. “I’d say Abby Finkenauer represents a district in Iowa and probably is reflective of the values of the people in that district. If you’d ask me which endorsement I’d want, I’d want the endorsement of a Gov. Vilsack or an Abby Finkenauer, in the state that I’m running in.”
To that end, Biden snagged several endorsements that went to Sanders in 2016, including Waterloo pastor and African American leader Frantz Whitfield, former AARP Iowa director Bruce Koeppl, Sioux City state Rep. Tim Kacena and Linn County Supervisor Brent Oleson.
If his recently amped up criticism of Biden is any indication, Sanders likewise views the former vice president as a threat. With 26 days to go until the caucuses, the race has tightened: a recent CBS/YouGov poll showed Sanders, Biden and Pete Buttigieg in a three-way tie for first place, with Warren not far behind.
Yet there’s been little pushback to the Sanders attacks from the Biden campaign, or even his top surrogates. One reason is that, since entering the race last April, Biden has sought to position himself as the antidote to Trump and not get sucked into personal exchanges.
But advisers also say there’s little to gain by attacking Sanders, given that at least a portion of their constituencies overlap. And so far in the primary, there’s evidence that negative hits on rivals aren’t working — candidates who’ve hit Biden the hardest, for example, have gone nowhere. Biden’s team believes that unlike 2016, the 2020 primary is defined by who can beat Trump, and poll after poll shows Democrats believe Biden is best suited to do that.
“I don’t think anybody on the Biden campaign is naive about Bernie’s very real chance of winning the nomination,” said Liz Allen, a former aide to both Biden and Barack Obama, and a Biden campaign surrogate. “I just think it’s doubling down on their strategy, which is to make the case about Donald Trump.”"

","Editor note: Law Enforcement Today has received countless messages over the past few days from officers in Colorado. Many have asked for resources finding police jobs out of Colorado – many others have said they plan on leaving the field altogether.
This is just the beginning. Here’s why.
COLORADO – New criminal justice reform has been passed to the governor’s desk in Colorado, and it tightens the screws on law enforcement officers across the state.
The Denver Post reported this comprehensive package in the wake of protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, MN.
As of Friday, June 19, the legislation has been signed into law.
Colorado Gov. Polis has signed SB-217 into law, ending qualified immunity for police, heavily restricting use of tear gas/projectiles on citizens, introducing criminal charges for cops who don’t intervene in excessive force cases + much more. All a direct result of protests. pic.twitter.com/Hus6sNB37r — Alex Burness (@alex_burness) June 19, 2020
Denver civil rights attorney Qusair Mohamedbhai said:
“This is, in my estimation, the largest single advancement of individual civil rights and liberties for Coloradans in a generation.”
The bill is sponsored by Senator Leroy Garcia, Senator Rhonda Fields, Representative Leslie Herod. Representative Serena Gonzales-Gutierrez and the American Civil Liberties Union worked together with Colorado legislators to draft the bill.
In this bill, SB20-217 Enhance Law Enforcement Integrity, choke holds are banned, along with a few additional key enhancements:
Deadly force must be used as a last resort No rubber bullets can be used Body cameras must be turned on during interaction with the public Qualified immunity is not a defense in the civil action A Statewide database must be created
This bill, which takes effect July 1, 2023, according to the drafted proposal, adds more burdens on law enforcement officers across the state of Colorado.
Colorado passes sweeping police reform bill that holds cops accountable for excessive force https://t.co/mKI41rvNZB — CBS News (@CBSNews) June 20, 2020
While raising the use of force threshold in certain cases, it also removes qualified immunity should the officer commit a crime, as deemed by this new law, in the course of his or her duty as a peace officer.
SB20-217 places the burden of civil lawsuit settlements on law enforcement officers if they allegedly violate any part of this new law, and states:
“[The] peace officer is personally liable for 5% of the judgment or $25,000, whichever is less, unless the judgment is uncollectible from the officer, then the officer’s employer satisfies the whole judgment.”
Across the nation, the demands to “defund” law enforcement have gained momentum, and in some places, department budgets have been impacted or they are forecast to be impacted. SB20-217 takes a great deal of control and consideration out of the hands of local law enforcement and puts it in the hands of the state.
It is unclear where the funds for the body cameras will come from, or the new database as required in this new proposed law. You can read the bill in its entirety here.
Broomfield Police Chief Gary Creager, the chair of the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police, said in a statement:
“Many of the policies included in Senate Bill 217 are already in place at the local level, but we are glad to have statutory support for changes that law enforcement can implement uniformly statewide. We look forward to continued partnership with our communities and the Legislature to ensure policing in Colorado is transparent and fair.”
One such piece of language in this bill is the requirement of officers to have a “legal basis” for making a “contact.”
The bill states:
“A peace officer shall report to the peace officer’s employing agency that information that the agency is required to report to the division of criminal justice.”
That Colorado would respond to the protests by passing such a substantial bill into law was far, far from a given. Here’s a behind-the-scenes look at how it happened and why it’s such a radical departure from business as usual at the Capitol. https://t.co/fK8e3shl8V — Alex Burness (@alex_burness) June 20, 2020
It should be noted, law enforcement officers have always been required to have reasonable suspicion, or as stated here, “a legal basis,” before initiating contact with a person, unless the contact was solely consensual, in which case the person could simply walk away if they so choose.
Sponsors of SB20-217 worked with law enforcement agencies and the ACLU to craft what they believe to be one of the most aggressive reforms in law enforcement. We would tend to agree.
Many cities are working on similar police reform, but Colorado is the first to announce a piece of legislation removing qualified immunity from officers heading to the governor’s desk for signature.
At least two dozen other cities have announced some degree of police reform in the past few weeks.
While Colorado attempts to strip qualified immunity from its police, the Supreme Court has recently said they will do no such thing.
Here’s Law Enforcement Today’s recent report on that.
At least the Supreme Court is still on the side of law and order…at least for now. The high court on Monday refused to give reconsideration to immunity from lawsuits, otherwise known as qualified immunity, given to police officers as well as other public officials who are accused of misconduct.
The decision by the justices not to hear cases on qualified immunity during their next term comes on the heels of the George Floyd death, who died in police custody last month in Minneapolis. Floyd’s death has led to some peaceful protests across the U.S., but also a large number of violent riots that led to looting and widespread damage in cities from New York to Los Angeles.
Over recent years, the court has set a rather high bar for the pursuit of lawsuits stemming from official misconduct. MSN reports that in order to do so, an officer’s conduct must violate “clearly established” laws or constitutional rights, which courts have found seldom happens, specifically because almost every allegation is different.
Judges in lower courts, however as well as legal experts from both sides of the political spectrum have questioned the principle of qualified immunity, which they claim creates an impossible standard for victims to meet, and which they claim offers near “blanket immunity for those accused of misconduct.”
Ironically, one of the most conservative justices on the high court, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from the decision not to hear a new case on the doctrine. The case involved a burglar who had surrendered and was bitten by a police dog.
“I have previously expressed my doubts about our qualified immunity jurisprudence,” he wrote. “Because our…qualified immunity doctrine appears to stray from the statutory text, I would grant this petition.”
Chief Justice John Roberts typically prefers smaller steps to big changes in court precedent. The fact that the court refused to hear this particular case is not necessarily an indication that it may not revisit qualified immunity down the road and either abolish it completely or scale it back significantly.
Prior to the most recent event in Minneapolis, justices had considered numerous petitions involving qualified immunity for public officials.
For example, the case cited above involved a man in Tennessee who was sitting with his hands in the air when he was bitten by a police K9.
Yet another case involved a 10-year-old Georgia boy who was shot while in his backyard while police were pursuing an unarmed criminal suspect.
Finally, in the third incident in California, police who were searching for a known gang member used tear gas grenades to try to flush the man out, as opposed to using a house key that provided to them by his ex-girlfriend.
The ACLU chimed in about qualified immunity, highlighting both the court’s decision on police accountability and the responsibility of Congress to abolish the doctrine.
LET has a private home for those who support emergency responders and veterans called LET Unity. We reinvest the proceeds into sharing their untold stories. Click to check it out.
David Cole, national legal director for the ACLU said, “We have seen the deadly consequences play out on the streets, and Black Americans have largely paid the price. Recent events demonstrate the urgent need for Congress to stand up for the rule of law and abolish qualified immunity—for anyone acting under color of law—to close the loophole allowing government officials to escape accountability for violating constitutional rights.”
The conservative leaning Supreme Court has been generous to police and public officials and has offered significant leeway where their conduct has come into question.
This past February, the court ruled that the family of a Mexican teenager shot and killed by the U.S. Border Patrol cannot seek damage because of the border that was between them (agents were on U.S. side, teenager on Mexican side).
In 2017, the court ruled officials from the Bush administration could not be held liable for the detention and harsh treatment of illegal immigrants in the days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
In 2015, the justices said that California police were entitled to immunity after they forcibly entered the room of a woman with a mental disability and shot her.
A University of Chicago Law School professor, who specializes in qualified immunity, found that 30 cases spanning three decades showed that the Supreme Court had only found that official misconduct violated clearly established law only two times.
Thomas, clearly the court’s most conservative member has said that the qualified immunity doctrine has no historical basis, and in a 2017 case, he said the court routinely substitutes “our own policy preferences for the mandates of Congress.”
On the opposite end of the spectrum, Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who represents the liberal wing of the court said in 2015 that the court’s “one-sided approach to qualified immunity transforms the doctrine into an absolute shield for law enforcement officers.”
House Democrats have proposed eliminating qualified immunity in its recent criminal justice reform bill, called the Justice in Policing Act of 2020. The bill comes on the heels of the George Floyd case.
Meanwhile, Republicans are expected to introduce their own proposal in the coming weeks. That bill is expected to address use of force, de-escalation tactics and improvements to federal data collection. That portion is expected to mirror part of the Democrats plan which is looking to create a national database to log police misconduct complaints. Qualified immunity has not been mentioned in any discussion of Republican plans.
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany has said that the elimination of qualified immunity for police is a “non-starter” for President Trump.

","Later, Bloomberg tried to jab at Sanders over the senator’s comments praising Fidel Castro’s literacy and health care programs, which Sanders defended again on Monday in an interview on CNN. Bloomberg proved to be a poor messenger. Sanders, in a bit of red-baiting jujitsu, threw back in Bloomberg’s face the former mayor’s own pro-China comments, which he similarly reiterated on stage when asked. “I was amazed at what Mayor Bloomberg said a moment ago,” Sanders said. “He said that the Chinese government is responsive to the Politburo, but who are they responsive to?”
At best, an issue that was supposed to be devastating for Sanders was a draw. The episode is reminiscent of a moment in the 2008 Democratic primary campaign when Barack Obama defied the foreign policy establishment and frustrated Hillary Clinton’s campaign by defending rather than retreating from his supposed gaffe about meeting with the leaders of Iran without preconditions.
Later, Obama’s top advisers, some of whom are now highly skeptical of Sanders, proudly pointed to that moment as a turning point in the campaign that highlighted Obama’s willingness to stand up to the kind of national security conventional wisdom that led Democrats to take misguided hawkish positions on issues like Iraq.
They are much further to the left than the Obama crew, but the group of progressive foreign policy advisers around Sanders define themselves by their willingness to defy the certitudes of Washington’s foreign policy establishment, which they derisively call “the blob,” and Sanders made it clear he will not apologize for his Cold War heresies.
It might be a good bet. The Obama opening to Cuba was in 2014 (and since reversed by Trump). Castro died in 2016. It’s true that Florida’s older Cuban-American community, which remains politically influential, is deeply unfriendly to politicians who focus on Castro’s literacy programs at the expense of his crimes. But the idea that it’s politically deadly in 2020 to articulate a more nuanced assessment of the communist dictator’s reign than what was politically acceptable during the Cold War and its aftermath is dubious.
Not only has time eroded the salience of the issue, but so has the past two decades of changes in communications and trust in elite institutions, which no longer control the acceptable bounds of American foreign policy on issues like Cuba. Trust in elites has been plummeting since the turn of the millennium, and Sanders has been both a catalyst and a beneficiary of that collapse.
If Bloomberg is supposed to be the Democratic Party’s Bernie slayer, he came to Charleston looking more like Joffrey Baratheon than Gregor Clegane.
If Bloomberg’s case against Sanders is overly aggressive, Warren’s is characterized by being subtle almost to a fault. She has tried to make the argument that she is a more effective senator and someone who understands how to use power to achieve tangible results, not just secure a politically pure voting record. But she was sometimes reluctant to even mention Sanders by name. One of the ways she has tried to distinguish herself from him is by noting that she supports getting rid of the filibuster and he doesn’t. Besides being a fairly high-concept process issue that is not on any lists of voters’ top concerns, Warren was reluctant to forcefully confront Sanders over it, saving her fire for Bloomberg.
“Understand this: Many people on this stage do not support rolling back the filibuster,” she said. “Until we're ready to do that we won't have change.” Her Goldilocks strategy of making fine distinctions between her and Sanders that don’t sting too much might look quite good in hindsight if he wins and she ends up being chosen as his running mate, but they are puzzling at the moment when the obvious mission is to stop him.
The three moderates — Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar — while joining various Sanders pile-ons, focused mostly on the astronomical cost of the Sanders agenda and his refusal to detail how he will pay for it. This line of attack seemed more fruitful than either dusting off old quotes from the Cold War or debating parliamentary procedure."

","A teenager in Lancaster, California, who may have died from the coronavirus last week, was turned away from an urgent care because he did not have health insurance, the city's mayor said.
In a video posted to YouTube on Wednesday, Lancaster Mayor R. Rex Parris said the 17-year-old had been sick for a few days and had no previous health conditions.
R Rex Parris, the mayor of Lancaster, Calif., confirmed the teen's death in a video posted to YouTube. City of Lancaster / via YouTube
""The Friday before he died, he was healthy. He was socializing with his friends,"" Parris said. ""By Wednesday, he was dead.""
Parris said the teen went to an urgent care March 18.
""He did not have insurance, so they did not treat him,"" Parris said, adding the boy was sent to a hospital.
En route, he went into cardiac arrest, according to the mayor. When the teen got to the hospital, he was revived and kept alive for six hours. But, it was too late, the mayor said.
""We've learned that once you go into respiratory issues, you have trouble breathing, you're short of breath and you have a fever, that is the time to get medical treatment without delay,"" Parris said.
The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health initially said the teen died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, but later backtracked. In a statement Tuesday, public health officials said his death will require further evaluation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
""Though early tests indicated a positive result for COVID-19, the case is complex and there may be an alternate explanation for this fatality,"" the statement said. ""Patient privacy prevents our offering further details at this time.""
Parris did not immediately return a request for an interview Friday.
NBC News was referred by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office to the county's office of emergency management for comment on the teen's cause of death. A spokesman said a cause of death would be determined by the CDC.
More than 4,000 cases of the coronavirus had been reported in California as of Friday afternoon."
demsocialist,"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/y3mjxg/general-electric-workers-walk-off-the-job-demand-to-make-ventilators
","On Monday, General Electric factory workers launched two separate protests demanding that the company convert its jet engine factories to make ventilators. At GE's Lynn, Massachusetts aviation facility, workers held a silent protest, standing six feet apart. Union members at the company’s Boston headquarters also marched six feet apart, calling on the company to use its factories to help the country close its ventilator shortage amid the coronavirus pandemic.

These protests come just after General Electric announced it would be laying off 10 percent of its domestic aviation workforce, firing nearly 2,600 workers, along with a “temporary” layoff of 50 percent of its maintenance workers in a bid to save the company ""$500 million to $1 billion.” This news came as Congress stood ready to pass a multi-trillion dollar corporate bailout that would include at least $50 billion in federal assistance and $25 billion in loans and temporary tax relief for the aviation industry, as well as a further $17 billion for federal assistance to companies deemed ""crucial to national security."" GE says it does not plan to request funds from the stimulus.
In a press conference, members of the Industrial Division of Communication Workers of America (IUE-CWA) explained how General Electric’s current layoffs and closures would undermine future efforts to increase ventilator production. Without experienced workers to operate now empty and idle factories, production will likely be slowed down.
IUE-CWA Local 86004 President Jake Aguanaga offered his plant, located in Arkansas City, Kansas, as an example of how much manufacturing capacity could be converted: more than 52 percent of his workforce has been laid off, and several football fields worth of factory space are currently sitting idle. “If GE trusts us to build, maintain, and test engines which go on a variety of aircraft where millions of lives are at stake, why wouldn’t they trust us to build ventilators?” he said.

GE’s Healthcare Division is already one of the country’s largest manufacturers of ventilators, so union members believe that other factories could be converted to produce the life-saving devices. Hospitals around the country say that there is a critical shortage of ventilators, and many experts have implored President Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act to require companies to produce them. Trump finally decided to make General Motors produce ventilators over the weekend, the first in a series of deals that may eventually call on General Electric to increase ventilator supply.
An information sheet put out by the IUE-CWA
The company says it has also ramped up ventilator production in its Madison, Wisconsin factory, and said that it also needs to consider the needs of its other customers, like the U.S. military, before changing the types of products a specific factory makes.
“GE is working around the clock to increase production of much-needed medical equipment. GE Healthcare has already doubled ventilator production capacity, with a plan to double it again by June, in addition to partnering with Ford Motor Company to further increase ventilator production,"" the company said in a statement. ""We continue to explore additional opportunities to support the fight against COVID-19, while continuing to support mission-critical work for our customers as well.”
CWA members say that they are desperate to help.
“Ventilators are desperately needed at hospitals in New York, California, Washington State, and Florida. They soon will be in short supply from the East Coast to the West Coast, from Puerto Rico to Hawaii, from Alaska and Illinois to Texas,” said CWA President Chris Shelton. “Most Americans are not aware that the best ventilators are already made by General Electric within the company’s healthcare division.”
“Our country depends on these highly skilled workers and now they’re wondering why they are facing layoffs instead of having the opportunity to use their unbelievable skills to help save lives,” said Shelton."

","An independent senator known for his Brooklyn accent. “Real change never, ever takes place from the top on down.” Populist message. “The level of wealth inequality in America is grotesque.” And anti-establishment appeal. “Establishment Democrats don’t generate excitement.” Bernie Sanders is jumping into the race for president, again. “Hi, I’m Bernie Sanders. I’m running for president.” In the 2016 primaries he pushed a democratic socialist message, and he found a big audience for it. He ultimately came up short. “I accept your nomination.” But many of his ideas have lived on. “In a modern moral and wealthy society, no American should be too poor to live.” In 2016, he was the only challenger to the Democratic establishment, but this time around he’ll be up against a crowded and diverse group of opponents. Some have adopted ideas he made popular in 2016. “How do you feel about Medicare for all?” “Medicare for all.” “Medicare for all.” So what are the issues he made pillars of the progressive agenda? A $15 minimum wage, tuition-free public college and Medicare for all. “... health care is a right, not a privilege.” But Sanders’s liberal credentials may have taken a hit over his perceived failure to address claims of sexism during his 2016 campaign. He has since apologized. “What they experienced was absolutely unacceptable.” So how has Sanders taken on President Trump? He’s been one of his most outspoken critics. “The most dangerous president in modern American history.” “Most people who observed him would agree he’s a pathological liar.” Trump has returned the insults. “Crazy Bernie.” “You know he’s always like complaining, complaining, he’s jumping around, the hair’s going crazy ... lunatic.” So what are his chances? He’s near the top of the early polls. He’s got some big advantages over his opponents, including a small-donor fund-raising list, a 50-state organization and fervent supporters. He has major name recognition and knows how to electrify a crowd. “We are going to take on the drug companies and their greed and lower the cost of prescription drugs.” But he could be up against a base who are looking for a fresh face to take on Trump, even if it’s on a platform that Bernie built."

","Two years ago, New York City was the site of a stunning victory for the U.S. Left that propelled a transformative candidate into office. When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won her primary to represent New York’s 14th District in 2018, defeating longtime Democratic incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley, she shocked the political establishment by showing that a left-wing challenger can run on a bold agenda, lift up movement demands, and win.
It appears New York will again be home to an electoral upset jolting the Democratic Party’s centrist wing.
After Tuesday night, it appears New York will again be home to an electoral upset jolting the Democratic Party’s centrist wing, as Jamaal Bowman holds a dominant lead over 16-term incumbent Eliot Engel in New York’s 16th District. Engel, the hawkish House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman who has held the seat since 1989 and saw mainstream Democrats rally around him in the waning days of the campaign, ended the night losing to Bowman by nearly 25 points. If Bowman holds onto his lead as mail-in and absentee ballots are counted in the coming days, he will almost assuredly be the next Congressional representative of the deep-blue district.
Bowman, a Black former public school principal, had the backing of a broad array of progressive groups in the state, including Justice Democrats, the Working Families Party and the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), of which Bowman is a member. He was also endorsed by Ocasio-Cortez as well as Bernie Sanders, whom Bowman cites as first inspiring him to run for office.
With protests over the police killing of George Floyd spreading across New York in recent weeks, Bowman has embraced the growing movement for racial justice—including the demand to redistribute funding from police departments into social programs, telling In These Times earlier this month, ​“We need to end the militarization of the police and transfer significant portions of the funding funneled to police forces into our schools and our healthcare facilities.” In a speech to supporters Tuesday night, Bowman referenced President Trump’s antipathy toward the protests, saying ​“You know what Donald Trump is more afraid of than anything else? A Black man with power.”
Throughout the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, Bowman transformed his campaign into a vehicle to help residents access food and services while calling on the federal government to cover workers’ wages and enact a moratorium on evictions, as well as mortgage, rent and debt payments during the crisis. His platform also includes key redistributive policies such as Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, free college, cancelling student debt, a wealth tax and major investments in affordable housing and public education.
“I cannot wait to get to Congress and cause problems,” Bowman said Tuesday night, singling out ​“institutional racism and sexism and classism and xenophobia” as ​“what we designed this campaign to fight against.”
The remarks evoked Ocasio-Cortez’s entrance to Congress in 2018 when she famously participated in a sit-in protest outside of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi’s office organized by the climate group Sunrise Movement to demand the passage of a Green New Deal. This confrontational approach to advocating for policies within Ocasio-Cortez’s own party has been criticized by some Democrats, including those such as former Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill who’ve been upset by her endorsement of primary challengers.
But Tuesday showed that this strategy can work, as not only does Ocasio-Cortez’s endorsed candidate look poised to topple the incumbent Engel, but she herself won a resounding primary victory in her own district, stating on Twitter: ​“Tonight we are proving that the people’s movement in NY isn’t an accident. It’s a mandate.”
Indeed, in the last cycle, Ocasio-Cortez was widely dismissed as being a serious threat to the establishment, and her opponent Crowley hardly campaigned in the primary. This time, she faced a well-funded challenger in CNBC contributor Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, who attempted to smear her democratic socialist rival by claiming ​“I am a real Democrat.” In the end, Ocasio-Cortez won by over 50 points.
A similar dynamic also played out in Bowman’s race, where Engel sensed his fortunes falling after a string of gaffes — including when he was caught on a hot mic saying, ​“If I didn’t have a primary I wouldn’t care” at a press event addressing recent protests. Democratic establishment heavyweights including Hillary Clinton, Sen. Chuck Schumer and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo sought to revive his campaign with their support. Engel also received over $1.5 million in financial support from the pro-Israel PAC Democratic Majority for Israel to fund his reelection, along with other big-money donations from lobbying groups. And he attempted to slam Bowman personally by claiming ​“he’s not really a Democrat.”
But in the end, these big-name endorsements, PAC contributions and attacks weren’t enough to hold off Bowman’s challenge — a testament to both the insurgent’s political skills, as well as to the growth of a vibrant left-wing electoral infrastructure in the United States.
In July 2019, Fox News reporter Brooke Singman quoted a senior Democratic source as saying of the Justice Democrats: ​“No one is afraid of those nerds. They don’t have the ability to primary anyone.” Bowman isn’t the only example of how this sentiment has been proven wrong. In March, progressive challenger Marie Newman — also a member of the Justice Democrats — ousted right-wing Democratic incumbent Dan Lipinski in Illinois.
The Working Families Party, which also endorsed Bowman, saw other successes on Tuesday, including the likely victory of progressive Mondaire Jones in the primary to represent New York’s 17th District in Congress. Jones is set to join probable 15th District winner Ritchie Torres in becoming the first openly gay, Black men in Congress.
DSA similarly flexed its electoral muscle on Tuesday, as multiple endorsed candidates either won their races or took the lead in New York. Besides Ocasio-Cortez and Bowman, incumbent State Sen. Julia Salazar won her primary by a massive margin. On a video call ahead of the results, Salazar said, ​“What’s really exciting to me is that we’re going to elect more democratic socialists tonight…and with that power we’re going to grow the working-class movement.”
She could soon be proven right, as public school teacher and DSA member Jabari Brisport appears likely to defeat machine-backed candidate Tremaine S. Wright to take a State Senate seat in Brooklyn. And Zohran Kwame Mamdani, another DSA-backed candidate, holds a lead in his race for State Assembly in Queens.
In 2018, mainstream media pundits and establishment Democrats — including Gov. Cuomo — attempted to write off Ocasio-Cortez’s shock win as a ​“fluke.” But Tuesday’s results are an indication that, at least in New York, the left-wing is a serious force to be reckoned with, capable of delivering votes, ousting powerful incumbents and advancing the demands of grassroots social movements.
As the likely 15th District winner Torres told the Washington Post ahead of the elections, ​“It’s like B.C. and A.D. — before AOC and after AOC…In the post-AOC world, incumbency is no longer an entitlement, no longer a guarantee of elected office.”

","Tim Bray, a well known senior engineer and Vice President at Amazon has “quit in dismay” because Amazon has been “firing whistleblowers who were making noise about warehouse employees frightened of Covid-19.” In an open letter on his website, Bray, who has worked at the company for nearly six years, called the company “chickenshit” for firing and disparaging employees who have organized protests. He also said the firings are ""designed to create a climate of fear.""
Amazon’s strategy throughout the coronavirus crisis has been to fire dissenters and disparage them both in the press and behind closed doors. There have been dozens of confirmed coronavirus cases at warehouses around the country, and workers have repeatedly said the company isn’t doing enough to protect them. Last week, Amazon ended a program that allowed workers to take unlimited unpaid time off if they fear getting sick from the coronavirus. Last Friday, Amazon workers together with Target, FedEx, Instacart, and Whole Foods workers, went on strike to protest their working conditions.
In statements to Motherboard, Amazon has said its own protesting workers are “spreading misinformation and making false claims about Amazon,” and that it “objects to the irresponsible actions of labor groups.” Last month, Amazon fired Chris Smalls, an Amazon worker in New York City. In a meeting, Amazon executives said that they believe Smalls is not “smart or articulate,” and that publicly they would focus on “laying out the case for why the organizer’s conduct was immoral, unacceptable, and arguably illegal,” according to leaked notes from that meeting obtained by VICE News.

In his resignation letter, Bray said that “firing whistleblowers isn’t just a side-effect of macroeconomic forces, nor is it intrinsic to the function of free markets. It’s evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture. I choose neither to serve nor drink that poison.”
Bray is the highest-level (now former) Amazon employee to speak out about the company’s workplace culture and treatment of its workers. He has been well-known in the software engineering world for decades.
Last year, he was the highest-ranking employee to sign an open letter promoting a shareholders’ resolution calling for climate action at the company, which continues to work with fossil fuel companies. A total of 8,702 employees signed that letter. Bray has previously been arrested for protesting the Trans-Mountain Pipeline in Canada.
After Amazon fired two employees who helped organize a climate walkout around the time of that letter, Bray said he “snapped.”
“VPs shouldn’t go publicly rogue, so I escalated through the proper channels and by the book,” he wrote. He said that he decided to quit in solidarity with those who have been fired. “Remaining an Amazon VP would have meant, in effect, signing off on the actions I despised. So I resigned.”
“The victims weren’t abstract entities but real people; here are some of their names: Courtney Bowden, Gerald Bryson, Maren Costa, Emily Cunningham, Bashir Mohammed, and Chris Smalls,” he added.
Amazon declined to comment on Bray's letter."

","The cash crunch comes at a critical time in the race, with nearly one-third of the delegates available in the primary up for grabs on Super Tuesday on March 3 — and only a handful of candidates able to marshal resources to advertise to voters in those 14 states. It’s why super PACs, demonized at the beginning of the 2020 primary, are suddenly jumping in to assist most Democratic candidates, and it’s why the campaigns are now making ever more urgent pleas for financial help.
On Thursday, Buttigieg issued a new call for money to his supporters, asking them to give $13 million to keep his campaign competitive after he raised just $6.2 million in January.
""We are now also up against a billionaire who is throwing colossal sums of money on television instead of doing the work of campaigning,” Buttigieg wrote in an email to supporters. “We need to raise a significant amount of money — about $13 million — before Super Tuesday on March 3rd in order to stay competitive.”
Bloomberg, fellow billionaire Tom Steyer and Sanders are the only candidates with more than $1 million in television advertising time already booked in the coming days in Super Tuesday states. Klobuchar has reserved about $874,000 so far in smaller states, skipping California and Texas, while Warren — whose campaign announced Thursday that she has raised $17 million so far in February — is advertising in smaller amounts in Colorado and Maine. Buttigieg has yet to reserve any TV ads beyond the South Carolina primary.
Meeting the $13 million goal would require Buttigieg to bring in more than $1 million per day until his self-imposed deadline.
""There are only a couple candidates out there with the funds to compete in all of those Super Tuesday states,” said Ami Copeland, deputy national finance director for Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign. Other campaigns “have to fight among themselves for the smaller states.”
That made Warren's strong debate performance Wednesday night especially important for her campaign, which said it raised over $5 million in less than 24 hours — a much-needed influx and her best fundraising day to date.
Meanwhile, single-candidate super PACs supporting Warren and Klobuchar have started airing ads in South Carolina and Nevada — after the candidates, especially Warren, have spent months decrying the influence of big money in politics. VoteVets, a super PAC that supports veterans and has endorsed Buttigieg, is airing ads backing him in the race.
Several major Buttigieg donors flocked to VoteVets in January, according to the new financial disclosures. They include Swati Mylavarapu, the finance chair of Buttigieg’s campaign, and Buttigieg bundler Hamilton James, executive vice chairman of the private equity giant Blackstone, who gave $50,000 and $15,000 respectively to the VoteVets PAC last month as it began aiding him on the airwaves.
Buttigieg raised less money from small-dollar donors in January than in previous months: 29 percent of his funds came from donors giving $200 or less, a drop from the 45 percent overall in 2019. The former mayor has been furiously raising money at high-dollar fundraisers in between campaign trail stops, including a four-event swing through the San Francisco Bay area in the days following the New Hampshire primary.
Only one of the nonbillionaire candidates could afford to spend heavily preparing for the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses and still have cash to spare: Sanders.
Sanders spent $26.5 million in January, airing television ads and paying a staff of more than 1,000 people while still keeping enough in the bank to jump into California and Texas media markets ahead of most of his rivals.

The next biggest-spending campaign, Warren’s, spent nearly all of its available cash in January, shelling out $22 million and entering February with only $2.3 million cash on hand. The Warren campaign has a particularly large staff of more than 1,200 people, which cost $8.6 million in salary and payroll taxes in January alone.
Warren has also had to shuffle her television ad reservations in South Carolina and Nevada, cutting overall ad spending. Warren’s campaign was in such financial need that it took out a $400,000 loan in January, disclosures show.
But her campaign is now taking outside help that could offer it a lifeline: On Wednesday, a new super PAC, Persist PAC, began reserving seven figures worth of TV ads, boosting Warren’s campaign with an ad highlighting her experience at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Asked on Thursday whether she would call on the super PAC to take the ads down, Warren declined to disavow the new group, despite her earlier opposition to super PACs in the race.
“If all the candidates want to get rid of super PACs? Count me in, I’ll lead the charge. But that’s how it has to be,” Warren told reporters."

","Democrats in Congress renewed their push to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 per hour on Tuesday, with leaders from both the House and Senate announcing they would introduce bills this week. The idea of a $15 wage floor from coast to coast has never had more momentum, or more political viability. Democrats have taken control of both chambers of Congress and the White House for the first time in eight years. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has already called on lawmakers to pass a $15 law, which has been the rallying cry of the Fight for $15 campaign by low-wage workers. But Democrats still face major hurdles in their effort to more than double the federal minimum wage ― and not just from Republicans. The party still has not garnered all the support for a $15 minimum wage that it would need within its own caucus, as some moderate Democrats continue to resist an aggressive increase. It shouldn’t be too hard to gain enough support to pass the bill in the House, although Democrats hold a slimmer majority in the chamber than they did when the Raise the Wage Act passed in 2019. Of the six Democrats — all from swing districts — who voted against that bill, only Rep. Kurt Schrader (Ore.) remains in Congress today. Four others lost reelection to Republican challengers, and New York Rep. Anthony Brindisi’s race against Republican Claudia Tenney still remains too close to call. With a smaller majority, Democrats can only afford to lose three votes and still pass legislation. All but three House Republicans voted against raising the minimum wage at the time, and then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked a vote on the bill in the upper chamber.
We must use reconciliation to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)
But Democrats have the barest of majorities in the Senate, where Vice President Kamala Harris would break a 50-50 tie, and getting to 60 votes seems nearly impossible. Republicans have repeatedly balked at the proposal to raise the minimum wage, citing the potential for job losses. Most business lobbies have opposed an increase for years, leading to the longest stretch ever without a raise to the federal wage floor. “If the federal government mandates a universal $15 minimum wage, many low-income Americans will lose their current jobs and find fewer job opportunities in the future,” Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said in a statement after Biden supported raising the minimum wage in a COVID-19 relief proposal unveiled before his inauguration. Unable to clear the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, Democrats likely would have to blow up the filibuster or use procedural maneuvers to have any hope of sending a bill to Biden’s desk. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the new Budget Committee chairman, advocated for the latter strategy. He said there was a moral imperative for Congress to pass a minimum wage hike for the first time since 2007. “There ain’t nobody in America … who can survive on $7.25 an hour,” Sanders said. “You can’t make it on nine bucks. You can’t make it on 12 bucks an hour. … The minimum wage must be a living wage enabling people to live with dignity.” Yet not all Senate Democrats are signed on. There’s a close eye on those like Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has become something of an avatar for the centrist politician and who could break from his party on the issue. In 2019, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would increase the pay of 17 million people, but also potentially cost 1.3 million jobs — though the study noted that there was “significant uncertainty” in that estimate. The “net benefit to the country and citizens is substantial,” Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) said at the time, citing additional estimates in the CBO report that the increased wage would lift 1.3 million Americans out of poverty. “The job loss number was a range ... there’s a lot of evidence now that it doesn’t cost any jobs in places that have already raised the wage.” Without Republicans on board, Democrats may need to push the bill through a legislative maneuver called budget reconciliation. It only requires the support of a simple majority, but has limitations under Senate rules. Reconciliation bills must have a budgetary impact that’s not just “merely incidental” to the policy. It’s not at all clear that increasing the minimum wage would impact federal spending or revenue in that way, and even supporters like Yarmuth are skeptical. Sanders isn’t humoring those limitations, however. He said his office has spoken with the CBO recently and that the last report on the legislation was too narrow in scope to accurately reflect the budgetary impact of increasing the minimum wage. “Please remember that if the Republicans could use reconciliation to pass trillions of dollars in tax breaks for wealthy and large corporations, if the Republicans can use reconciliation process to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and if the Republicans could use reconciliation to try and repeal the Affordable Care Act ... then we can and we must use reconciliation to protect the working families of this country,” he said. “We must use reconciliation to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.”
Tom Williams via Getty Images Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.) said Democrats would push the minimum wage increase as a measure on the House floor, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said senators would try to insert it into a COVID-19 relief bill."

","“It really pisses me off when people say, ‘We can’t do Medicare for All.’ We’re seeing constant handouts for corporations, we’re seeing endless wars, nepotism and corruption all over the place,” he added. “It’s naive to think that we can’t expand one of the most popular and one of the most successful government programs that we’ve ever seen be able to provide health care.”
“Something that Bernie has that other candidates don’t is he has that background and that consistency,” Eadon said. “He is not just saying ‘Medicare for All’ or ‘no corporate money’ while he’s running for president. He’s been there all along.”
The political consultant, whose condition has cost his family an estimated $40,000 in out-of-pocket costs and brought them to the brink of bankruptcy, said Sanders’s record won him over. Eadon is now an outspoken proponent for “Medicare for All” and an admirer of Sanders’s consistent support for the plan.
Eadon, a 36-year-old veteran of Barack Obama ’s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, does not fit the typical profile of a Sanders endorser. But a multiyear bout with trigeminal neuralgia , a rare nerve disease that causes acute facial pain, has ruined his finances and reshaped his politics.
Derek Eadon, a former deputy campaign manager for Julián Castro and ex-chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party , announced his support for Bernie Sanders ’s presidential bid Friday, handing the Vermont senator one of his most prominent endorsements from an Iowa Democrat.
Joe Raedle/Getty Images Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speaks at a campaign event in West Des Moines, Iowa, on Dec. 30. Derek Eadon, a former deputy campaign manager for Julián Castro, who has dropped out of the presidential race, has endorsed him.
Eadon emphasized his respect for Castro and expressed his hope that the former housing secretary runs for president again. But Eadon, who worked for the Obama campaign successor group Organizing for America during the Affordable Care Act fight, also now sees the theory behind nominating someone moderate to attract Republican support as “naive.”
“It’s more important to have somebody in the White House where they’re a constant advocate, they’re very aggressive, they’re fierce on these issues,” Eadon said.
Eadon began experiencing severe pain in his face in 2013. In 2015, it was diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia.
For a few years after that, the disease did not interfere with his professional responsibilities. He ran for chair of the Iowa Democratic Party in January 2017, winning an upset victory against a former Iowa state Senate majority leader.
In March 2017, at a party event in Davenport, he experienced an episode of severe nerve pain in his face that marked the beginning of a spiral into a debilitating illness. He resigned from the top post at the end of June 2017 to undergo radiation treatment.
The radiation therapy began to relieve some of his pain after about a year, allowing him to resume work. Toward the end of 2018, he took a job with the progressive group Run for Something. He struck up a dialogue with Castro and accepted a position as his deputy campaign manager in January 2019.
For a while after the relief of the pain that had plagued him, Eadon experienced numbness in parts of his face. It led to injuries like him accidentally biting through his tongue, but it was manageable.
Then, last June, he had another episode of acute pain, this time in his eye. He returned to Iowa to seek treatment, resigning his post on the Castro campaign in July.
The ordeal has been nightmarish for Eadon, his schoolteacher wife, and their young daughter and son. Republican cuts to public-sector unions’ bargaining power have left his wife with far stingier health care, according to Eadon. Without help from family members helping to pay his medical bills, they would have lost their house in West Des Moines.
Eadon is feeling healthy again and wants to get to work helping Sanders before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3.
Eadon is likely to become a valued surrogate for the campaign. He caucused for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and said he thought his friend, Iowa Democratic strategist Pete D’Alessandro, was “crazy” for working for Sanders then.
But he has come to appreciate the staying power of Sanders’s coalition in a crowded presidential field. He said that Sanders is the most electable of all the candidates.
“It’s not only that he’s bringing in working-class folks. He’s also continuing to bring in new people,” Eadon said. “We can’t just keep doing the same policy ideas and the same candidates just getting a small amount of swing voters. We have to broaden what we’re doing.”"

","The ramifications of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s stunning primary defeat of longtime Queens Democratic boss and Congressman Joe Crowley (D-NY) extend well beyond the confines of Capitol Hill.
The 28-year-old member of Democratic Socialists of America—who shockingly won in New York’s 14th congressional district on a leftist platform of Medicare for All, abolishing ICE, and a federal jobs guarantee—inspired a major boost in membership for the organization on Wednesday.
According to Lawrence Dreyfuss, a program associate for DSA, the organization saw a surge of 1,152 new memberships on Wednesday—about 35 times more sign-ups than on an average day.
The last major membership bump DSA experienced was in the month following President Trump’s election, during which time they had about six times more sign-ups than in the previous month.
DSA has undergone a renaissance of sorts in the Trump era, ballooning in size from some 5,000 members in November 2016 to 40,000 nationwide.
The left-wing group’s growth has been attributed in part to broader resistance to the new administration and wider acceptability of the “democratic socialist” label championed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).
“The people of NY-14 demanded more from its representative than empty promises and deep pockets,” Christian Bowe of DSA’s National Political Committee said after Ocasio’s win. “We’re proud of this victory, and we know this is only one of many more to come.”
DSA members themselves had begun winning elections, primarily on the state level, prior to Ocasio-Cortez. Among those who’ve achieved political success in the past year are Lee Carter, elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 2017, and Summer Lee and Sara Innamorato, who both defeated long-term incumbent Democrats in Pennsylvania."

","Misty Rebik, Sanders’ former Iowa state director and executive director of his campaign committee, Friends of Bernie Sanders, is taking the helm as his new chief of staff. Ari Rabin-Havt, Sanders’ 2020 deputy campaign manager who previously worked in his Senate office, is serving as his new legislative director.
“He’s bringing in campaign hands who worked with him through the campaign very closely, like Ari and Misty, to basically staff the official office,” said a source with knowledge of the changes. ""It may be that he's finally coming to terms with his role as a full-time senator.”
Sanders’ previous chief of staff, Caryn Compton, is leaving his office, and his former legislative director, Lori Kearns, has moved onto a position as staff director for the Health, Education, Labor & Pensions subcommittee on primary health and retirement security, which Sanders chairs. Communications Director Keane Bhatt is resigning imminently. Sanders is also hiring Bill Dauster, former deputy chief of staff for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, as chief counsel for the Budget committee.
“As Senator Sanders takes on the new responsibilities of incoming chairman of the Budget committee, our office is excited to be bringing on new staff to help us advance the senator’s agenda in the new Congress,” said Rebik in a statement. “As we reorganize the office, we understand the new opportunities that the new Democratic Congress and White House present. We are sad to see our departing staffers go, and we wish them our very best and thank them for their incredible work over the years.”
On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell came to an agreement that allowed Democrats to finally assume committee chair roles.
Those familiar with the shakeup said the shifts are in some cases the result of staffers who have been alongside Sanders for years as he pursued the White House deciding it’s time to part ways.
Sanders ran for president in 2016 and 2020, effectively spending five years campaigning. During that time, he attracted many aides both inside and outside his campaign who were dedicated to lifting him to the White House. Sanders, who is 79, is not expected by those familiar with his thinking to run again, barring some highly unusual circumstances.
Sanders made a play to become President Joe Biden’s Labor Secretary, but Boston Mayor Marty Walsh was ultimately tapped for the job. If he had been appointed, Sanders would have had the power to staff the Department of Labor.
Biden said he seriously considered Sanders for Labor Secretary, but that the two men both thought the outcome of the Senate elections in Georgia, in which Democrats picked up two seats, changed the equation. “Bernie and I agreed — and as a matter of fact, Bernie said — ‘we can't put control of the Senate at risk on the outcome of a special election in Vermont,’” Biden said last month.
Compton is leaving Sanders’ office to provide caregiving for family members, according to a person familiar with the staff changes. To some in Sanders’ office, the Vermont senator’s decision to offer Kearns the subcommittee job was seen as him presenting her with a diminished role, though others disagreed and viewed it as a lateral move or even improvement.
“As one of our longtime lead staffers on health care, drug pricing, 'Medicare for All,' community health centers and other top priorities for the Senator, Lori is going to take on a critical role as staff director for the HELP subcommittee, a senior role that allows her to flex her policy chops and advance these issues in the Democratic majority,” said a Sanders aide.
Matt Duss, Sanders’ foreign policy adviser who has become a well-known figure among progressive activists, is expected to depart for a position in the Biden administration’s Department of State, sources said. That is not finalized, however.
If that scenario materializes, it will be viewed by many on the left as a victory for progressives.
Duss declined to comment. A spokesperson for the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

","MANASSAS, Va. (WDBJ) - Delegate Lee Carter formally announced Friday his intention to run for Governor of Virginia on the 2021 Democratic ticket.
Carter was elected to the House of Delegates in 2017. He has introduced legislation to reform the workers’ compensation system, allow teachers to strike, repeal the anti-worker “right to work” law, legalize cannabis, end cash bail and abolish the death penalty.
“For too long, we’ve listened to career politicians and pundits tell us that there is no other way,” Delegate Carter said in his launch video. “But no more. In this primary we can finally pick a Governor that will fight for the rest of us.”
Governor Ralph Northam has signed multiple bills put forth by Carter into law. These include a ban on children strip searches, the establishment of worker cooperatives as legal entities in the Commonwealth and a $50 a month cap on copays for insulin products. The latter went into effect Friday, January 1.
“For the teachers and nurses. For shipbuilders and students struggling to make tuition. For everyone with a stack of bills on the kitchen table waiting to get paid. I’m running for Governor so the rest of us can finally get what we need and deserve.”

","New Hampshire voters have seen her advertising, through the Boston media market, for almost a decade. She had a large and well-funded operation in the state that was frequently described as the best organized of all the Democratic presidential candidates. The New Hampshire electorate is famously friendly to female candidates. The state’s two senators and one of its two House members are female.
According to exit polls, 57 percent of voters on Tuesday were female, up two points from 2016. A majority of voters were college graduates (53 percent), liberal or somewhat liberal (60 percent), and their three big issues were health care, climate change and income inequality. A big majority supported single-payer (61 percent). In short, these were Warren voters.
In that sense, the Warren collapse is even worse than the Biden collapse. Joe Biden was always fighting a two-front war against regional favorites, while much of Warren’s purported strength as a potential victor rested on her favorite daughter — cousin? — status in New Hampshire.
What overwhelmed both Warren and Biden were the monumental effects of Iowa and the debate on Friday. In this sense, it’s a cruel and arbitrary way for them to have been treated. After a year of vigorous campaigning in the state, half of New Hampshire voters decided their choice in the final few days of the race, and 53 percent of those voters overwhelmingly supported the two candidates who dominated the headlines at the end: Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar.
Warren and Biden, two of the Democratic Party's most experienced and compelling officials, were shunted aside at the very end because they had a bad week. Neither candidate is projected to win a single New Hampshire delegate.
But if this was an enormously disappointing night for the two people who once seemed like they would be fighting a one-on-one fight for the nomination through the spring, it was hardly an overwhelming thumping by Bernie Sanders. Even counting for the fact that in 2016 he was in a two-person race, the comparison with his smashing victory over Hillary Clinton (22 points and 60 percent of the vote) and, as of late Tuesday night, his less-than-2-point squeaker over Buttigieg, is notable. Sanders dominated the state in 2016, winning every county. Buttigieg and Klobuchar ripped holes through that map everywhere, turning color-coded maps from 2016 that showed a Sanders rout into a patchwork of colors.
Perhaps more important, Sanders overpromised and underdelivered. He has premised his campaign on nothing less than sparking a political revolution in which disaffected and first-time voters — especially young ones — pour into American politics to carry him to the White House. It didn’t happen in Iowa, and it didn’t happen in New Hampshire.
The percentage of young voters actually declined from 2016 to 2020 in New Hampshire, from 19 percent to 14 percent. Independents were a larger share of the electorate, but they did not break nearly as decisively for Sanders as they did in 2016. He received support from just 29 percent of self-described independents this time, as opposed to 73 percent (!) in 2016. Buttigieg, who is derided by Sanders supporters as “Mayo Pete” and “Wall Street Pete,” ran competitively with that group at 24 percent.
Two states down and no revolution yet.
Buttigieg and Klobuchar’s strong finishes against three opponents who were predicted to dominate New Hampshire (and the remainder of the race) was historic. For Buttigieg, it was a testament to the enduring power of the bounce that accompanies winning Iowa, where Buttigieg edged past Sanders in the delegate fight.

For Klobuchar it was more unusual. There are not obvious historical examples of a candidate placing fifth in Iowa and then surging to a close third in New Hampshire. But in a race in which Democrats have had lots of trouble choosing a candidate, Klobuchar captured the imagination of those indecisive late-deciding voters at just the right moment.
At her election-night party in Concord on Tuesday evening, I talked to a typical member of this curious species: a woman who voted for Sanders in 2016, was contemplating Buttigieg late in the process, and settled on Klobuchar the morning she voted. As of late Tuesday, Klobuchar had raised $5 million since the last debate. She will surely raise a lot more this week. She is staffing up to send organizers into the field in states where she has had no presence. She — and Sanders and Buttigieg — will face a heightened level of scrutiny in the days ahead. But after months of false starts, the long-predicted Klobuchar moment finally arrived.
Where does this leave the race? I stand by Tuesday’s analysis: there is no route to an early knockout for any of the candidates. Sanders remains a factional candidate who has not yet demonstrated he can win more than roughly a quarter of the vote. Buttigieg and Klobuchar will have to prove themselves beyond the first two states to convince the larger universe of Democrats to rally around either one of them.
Biden cannot be dismissed until after the results of South Carolina are known. Warren has a legacy fundraising and organizational operation — and high favorability — that might all be resurrected if voters fail to consolidate around one of her opponents and return to her. There are several debates coming up, and as we saw in New Hampshire, they can have a galvanizing effect on the race.
Don’t count any of them out just yet. There’s a long race ahead."

","POLITICO Dispatch: January 11 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced that Democrats are moving forward with trying to remove President Donald Trump from office.
As a person with good lawyers and experience being investigated, Trump would undoubtedly claim these comments were nothing more than First-Amendment-protected political speech if he were charged with encouraging the mob to commit seditious conspiracy. But that might not help. In 1969, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Brandenberg v Ohio, found that the government can punish inflammatory speech when it is “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.”
Trump passes the test. As his statements make clear, he brought the members of the mob to D.C. He convened them at a rally; he and others inflamed the audience with lies about a stolen election and their duty to save the country from the certification that was underway at that moment. He pointed them at the Capitol and persuaded them to “do something about it.” He offered to go with them. He had every reason to believe his rhetoric would lead to violence in the same way it did at his rally on December 12.
Trump could also have a bigger problem. If the federal murder probe into Officer Sicknick’s death determines that those responsible were incited to violence at the Save America rally just hours before, Trump could find himself charged with inciting a murder. Proving the president intended to incite the crowd to commit murder would be a long shot bordering on impossible. But the mere fact that we are discussing this remote possibility is a sad statement about the state of this presidency.
The Department of Justice, the FBI and the Capitol Police are conducting a broad and thorough investigation. The facts uncovered in that investigation—not politics, fear or favor—will determine who is prosecuted. While there is little question that Trump’s words at the rally, and those of others (Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump, Jr.), incited the crowd to what the Brandenburg court called “imminent disorder,” we will have to wait on the prosecutors to assess the merits of any possible cases.
In the meantime, the images of that disorder erupting in an excruciating torrent of violence against the foundation of American democracy will repeat on an endless loop in our memories. If our democracy is to recover from that assault, all those responsible should be held accountable."

","Donald Trump’s pick for health secretary, Alex Azar, was previously an executive at a pharmaceutical company that repeatedly raised the prices of its drugs and tripled the cost of its top-selling insulin over the five years he served as a company president, it has emerged.
Mr Trump announced his choice on Monday, tweeting that Mr Azar would be a “star for better healthcare and lower drug prices”.
If Mr Azar becomes Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary, he will oversee a $1tr (£760bn) department responsible for America’s major insurance programmes, including Obamacare, public health, medical research and food and drug safety.
He would succeed Tom Price, who resigned in September after allegedly using private and government planes at the expense of taxpayers.
The nomination has sparked criticism, however, over Mr Azar’s own track record at Eli Lilly, a pharmaceuticals giant that was one of several to repeatedly increased the price of insulin, a life-saving drug used to treat diabetes.
Mr Azar worked as HHS deputy secretary under President George W Bush from 2005 to 2007 before joining drugmaker Eli Lilly as a senior vice president of corporate affairs and communications, according to his LinkedIn profile.
He served as a high-ranking executive at the company for ten years, becoming the president of Lilly USA in 2009, and was with the company as it tripled the price of its insulin product, Humalog.

Just over a year ago, the Washington Post reported that the price of Humalog had risen from $21 (£16) a vial to more than $250 (£190) over the past 20 years.
✕ The Trump Organization is worth one tenth of value previously reported
Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders condemned the nomination on Twitter, writing: “Trump was clearly never serious about this promise to lower drug prices.

“We need an HHS secretary who will take on the drug industry’s greed, not someone who has financially benefited from it.”
Last year, Mr Sanders called for a federal probe into whether Eli Lilly, Sanofi SA, Merck & Co Inc and Novo Nordisk colluded to raise prices on insulin and other drugs used to treat diabetes.
Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley was also critical of the nomination, tweeting: “If my priority were bringing down RX prices, I probably wouldn’t tap a pharmaceutical industry exec accused of colluding to drive up the cost of insulin.”
Mr Azar’s nomination is unusual because HHS secretaries have previously come from the ranks of elected officials, such as governors, or top executive branch managers, rather than coming from the industry meant to be regulated by the department.
The pharmaceuticals executive has been critical of Obamacare in the past. In a May interview with Fox Business Network, Mr Azar said Obamacare was “circling the drain” and was part of a “fundamentally broken system”. “It’s certainly circling the drain,” Mr Azar said of the Affordable Care Act.
“Obamacare plans are following the laws of economics. First, if you’re running an insurance company, you’ve got to be able to make money, and in order to make money, you’ve got to be able to predict risk.
✕ Trump has his own awkward water bottle moment
“The Obamacare system has made it impossible to predict risk.” The HHS secretary nominee added: “There’s actually fairly few levers that the government can do at this point to stabilise this broken system.”

Protect Our Care campaign director Brad Woodhouse also criticised the nomination, writing in a statement: “President Trump has nominated in Mr Azar someone who shares his misguided and factually flawed views on the Affordable Care Act.
“Mr Azar, a drug industry lobbyist, has been a harsh critic of the ACA and has gone so far as to say the law is ‘circling the drain’ despite evidence to the contrary.
“In fact, the ACA is working despite President Trump and former HHS Secretary Tom Price’s repeated efforts to repeal and sabotage it – open enrolment is off to a strong start, plans remain affordable and every county in the country is covered.”
“The nomination of a new HHS Secretary could be an opportunity for Trump and Republicans to turn the page on their repeal and sabotage agenda,” Mr Woodhouse said.

“Sadly, we know President Trump will never turn the page, and in Mr Azar, he appears to be looking for a willing partner in his spiteful ongoing campaign to deny affordable health care to millions of Americans.”
Before Mr Azar can take up the role as HHS secretary, his nomination must be approved by the Republican-controlled US Senate."

","Sanders’ Iowa state director, Misty Rebik, sent a memo to staffers and supporters on Wednesday night that said the campaign has ""a viable path forward to achieve a clean sweep and retake the lead in state delegate equivalents and national pledged delegates.”
Sanders’ aides believe that he has won the satellite caucuses, which were held for residents who could not attend the 7 p.m. caucuses, according to their unverified internal results. Not all of the satellite caucuses have reported their figures so far.
Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ senior adviser, said Tuesday that he finished strongly in the satellite caucuses “due to our organizing among blue-collar workers, Latinos and Muslim Americans.”
Reports circulated on Monday that showed Sanders performing well in some individual satellite caucus sites with diverse caucus-goers. A preliminary analysis of the overall results by Iowa Starting Line also found that Joe Biden ""does not appear to have won any of the mostly African-American precincts that are reporting right now. Sanders carried most of those.""

Sanders' team has sought to use those results to make the case that he is the strongest Democratic candidate to take on President Trump.
""We're winning by turning out a multi-racial, working-class coalition, sending a message to the rest of the country that this is how to defeat Donald Trump,” Rebik said in the memo.
Rebik acknowledged in the message that, while the campaign achieved many of its goals in the first-in-the-nation caucus, “what we didn’t get was our victory party in Iowa.” She told her team that ""while that is deeply frustrating and heart-breaking, we cannot forget why we are here.""
Some Sanders aides expressed frustration over the slow results trickling in from Iowa on social media on Wednesday. At one point, the Iowa Democratic Party posted inaccurate results, which appeared to misallocate some Sanders caucus-goers, and said on Twitter that there ""will be a minor correction to the last batch of results and we will be pushing an update momentarily.”
Bill Neidhardt, the Iowa deputy state director, responded, “Day 3 of this mess.”
Briahna Joy Gray, Sanders’ national press secretary, said jokingly of the state party, “You’re doing great sweetie.”
In addition to denying Sanders a potential victory speech Monday, the delayed results also meant that Sanders did not raise money off of the completed results that night. Sanders’ team did not reveal its fundraising numbers over the last few days.
Sanders’ campaign said Thursday that his average donation in January was $18.72, and more than 99.9 percent of his donors had not given the maximum allowable amount and could therefore donate again."

","Biden’s admission marked a sharp departure from the rosy predictions that he and his campaign had been making about Iowa both before and after Monday’s caucus, where full results have still not been released. With 71 percent of precincts reporting, the former vice president is in fourth place.
Biden’s speech was one of the most fiery of his campaign as he went after the nominal winner in Iowa, Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor whom he accused of having too little experience.
Donors, supporters and even staff have grown increasingly nervous about Biden’s standing in the race because they fear he’ll finish badly in New Hampshire — where polls show he’s trailing Bernie Sanders — and in Nevada, where polls show he’s leading as of now.
“We can’t lose three straight like that,” a Biden adviser confided.
Just one day earlier, Biden and his campaign were predicting he would do well in Iowa, even as the campaign cast doubt on the process of tallying the votes.
“We had a good night last night in Iowa. I know you think that’s silly,” Biden said Tuesday at his first stop in Nashua, implicitly acknowledging the doubts about his performance while trying to reassure the crowd. “But everything we can feel, it’s good. Here’s the deal, we think we’re going to come out of there really doing well.”

That night, in Concord, Biden joked that Iowa’s results would be so late that New Hampshire’s Feb. 11 vote would be decided beforehand.
Biden also downplayed his Iowa performance.
“The first four [states] are the key” Biden said, ignoring the fact that he once predicted he would carry the state.
Biden said he would accept the Iowa results, “as long as I come out of there with delegates and there’s been a full count."""

","Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a newly declared presidential candidate, has turbocharged the progressive attack on income inequality with a proposal for a “wealth tax” aimed at Americans with net worth of more than $50 million.
Warren herself hasn’t issued many details of her plan. But according to UC Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who advised her on the proposal, the tax would be 2% on net worth above $50 million and another 1% on net worth above $1 billion. They say it would affect about 75,000 U.S. households, or less than 0.1% of the total, and raise $2.75 trillion over 10 years. That’s about 1% of gross domestic product per year.
Warren’s announcement, made Thursday via Twitter, is certain to be met with two big questions: Is a wealth tax constitutional, and is it necessary? Legal scholars say the answer to the first is yes, and economists (and the evidence of your own eyes) say the answer to the second also is yes.
Whenever there is ... unemployed poor, it is clear that the laws of property have been so far extended as to violate natural right. Thomas Jefferson, 1785

Let’s take the questions in turn.
The notion that a wealth tax is unconstitutional derives from a provision of the Constitution prohibiting “direct” taxation unless it’s “apportioned among the states.” That’s generally taken to mean that the amount raised from each state must be proportionate to its population.
That means a direct tax can raise the same amount from Connecticut as from Mississippi because they have roughly the same population (3 million), even though the first is the richest state in the union (with per capita income of more than $36,000) and the second is the poorest ($20,000).
We need structural change. That’s why I’m proposing something brand new – an annual tax on the wealth of the richest Americans. I’m calling it the “Ultra-Millionaire Tax"" & it applies to that tippy top 0.1% – those with a net worth of over $50M. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 24, 2019

But two legal scholars say this constitutional interpretation is wrong. They’re Dawn Johnsen of Indiana University and Walter Dellinger, a former U.S. solicitor general, of Duke University. Their analysis appeared last year, and is regarded as the leading work on the issue, though their position isn’t unanimously held. (Thanks to Bruce Bartlett for bringing it to my attention.)
Johnsen and Dellinger dismiss the constitutionality issue as “conventional wisdom” that is casually repeated but is the product of “faulty constitutional understanding.” It’s partially the result of a Supreme Court ruling in 1895 known as Pollock that was narrowly — and they say wrongly — decided, and that has been undermined by a string of subsequent Supreme Court decisions.
It’s also generally disdained by legal authorities. Among them is Bruce Ackerman of Yale Law School, who wrote in 1999 that before Pollock, the court used a very narrow definition of “direct tax,” and has returned to that narrow view since. As a unanimous court declared in 1983, he noted, “Congress’ power to tax is virtually without limitation.”
The “direct tax” language in the Constitution, Johnsen and Dellinger observe, was murky even to the drafters. The Constitution refers explicitly only to a “capitation” or head tax, which is levied on each individual and thus can be easily apportioned by population. The authors assert that the clause wasn’t the product of “any principled decision to limit Congress’s authority to tax income, property, or wealth.”

In any event, the court rejected Pollock only a few years later, by upholding an estate tax and a gift tax — that is, a tax on net worth. After the 16th Amendment, which declared an income tax constitutional, was ratified in 1913 as a response to Pollock, discussions of the constitutionality of taxes other than the head tax dropped off the Supreme Court docket.
Still, since debate over the constitutionality of a wealth tax might gum up the process of enacting one, it might make sense to avoid the issue by strengthening taxes that already have passed the court’s muster. That’s the argument of Miranda Perry Fleischer of the University of San Diego.
Fleischer proposes several second-best alternatives to short-circuit the debate. These include raising the tax rate on capital gains, which is lower than that on ordinary income, and taxing capital gains at death — rather than allowing heirs to avoid embedded capital gains tax by stepping up their cost basis upon the bequest.
Under current law, if a taxpayer bought, say, a stock at $100 and leaves it to heirs when it’s worth $1,000, that $900 gain never will be taxed. Fleischer proposes to levy the tax when the taxpayer dies. Since the Supreme Court hasn’t objected to estate taxes, problem solved.

That brings us to the question of whether a wealth tax is needed. The answer here is unmistakably yes. The concentration of wealth in America has reached levels that make the gilt of the 19th century Gilded Age look like dross. There’s sound economic and social sense in taxing the hell out of excessive incomes and excessive wealth.
As Saez and Zucman observe, the top 0.1% today control almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%. Wealth disparity on this scale has a distinctly corrosive effect on society and democracy. As political economist Benjamin Friedman wrote in 2009, its “grave moral consequences” include “racial and religious discrimination, antipathy toward immigrants, [and] lack of generosity toward the poor” — all features of our current political landscape.
That’s not even to mention the economic consequences of placing so much wealth in the hands of people who can’t use it productively, while the majority of Americans struggle to make ends meet on working-class wages.
The top 0.1% now control almost as large a share of U.S. wealth as the bottom 90%. (Saez and Zucman 2016)

The Founding Fathers were unnerved by this very phenomenon. Thomas Jefferson wrote to James Madison in 1785, “whenever there is in any country, uncultivated lands and unemployed poor, it is clear that the laws of property have been so far extended as to violate natural right.”
In his autobiography, Jefferson wrote of the bills he had advocated or passed to form “a system by which every fibre would be eradicated of antient or future aristocracy; and a foundation laid for a government truly republican.” His goal was to “prevent the accumulation and perpetuation of wealth in select families.”
Perhaps fortunately, we don’t have to go far to see and hear these consequences spelled out. The Trump administration has done much of the work for us, especially in its response to the pain it’s imposed on government workers deprived of paychecks by the government shutdown. These are people who are never shy about nominating someone else for martyrdom.
The top 0.1% now control almost as large a share of U.S. wealth as they did in the 1920s, which did not end well. (Saez and Zucman 2016)

Start with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, whose fortune is estimated at $700 million. In an interview Thursday he advised furloughed workers to take out short-term loans. “People might have to pay a little bit of interest,” he said, “but the idea that it’s a paycheck or zero is not a really valid idea.” He said credit unions were stepping up with low-interest loans. What he didn’t say was that the credit union at his agency, the Commerce Department, was charging workers 8.99% interest per year on emergency loans of up to $5,000.
Larry Kudlow, Trump’s chief economist, told reporters that government employees working without pay during the shutdown were “volunteering” out of “their love for the country and the office of the presidency and presumably their allegiance to President Trump.” And Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law, commiserated with unpaid workers by counseling that “it is a little bit of pain, but it’s going to be for the future of our country.”
The super-rich haven’t been shy about speaking up for their prerogatives. Asked at the Davos economic conference this week about the suggestion by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to raise the top marginal income tax rate to 70% on high incomes, computer tycoon Michael Dell dismissed it out of hand.
“Name a country where that’s worked. Ever,” Dell said. To which Erik Brynjolfsson of MIT, a member of Dell’s speaking panel, promptly replied: “The United States.” Brynjolfsson schooled Dell by informing him that from the 1940s through the 1960s the top rate on income ran as high as 94%. “Those were actually pretty good years for growth,” he said.

Dell also said he contributes to society via a family foundation, adding: “I feel much more comfortable with our ability as a private foundation to allocate those funds than I do giving them to the government.”
It’s proper to observe that Dell’s multibillion-dollar fortune is based on mail and online orders of computers — in other words, on infrastructure created and funded by the government he disdains.
The question boils down to whether you want society funded out of the whims of Michael Dell or the debated judgments of your elected representatives. Thomas Jefferson would vote for the latter, and the extinction of inherited wealth by taxation if necessary. Anti-tax crusaders who never tire of dragooning the Founding Fathers into their arguments should take that one to heart.

","You might have heard that Social Security checks are going up 2.8%, the biggest rise in seven years. That translates into an average benefit of $1,461 a month, up $39.
While welcome, it’s necessary to remember that the increase is tied to inflation. Higher payouts will simply enable retirees to keep up with the rising cost of living. It doesn’t mean that anyone’s standard of living will go up—as if an extra $1.28 a day will do much in the first place. Think of a treadmill: You’re not going anywhere.
In fact, retirees and those who are eyeing retirement risk going in a different direction: backward. A study by the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at the New School finds that about 40% of middle-class Americans will live close to or in poverty by the time they reach age 65. “Golden years?” For millions, it’s doubtful.
Since more people retire at 62 than any other age (because that’s the earliest they can tap into Social Security), let’s use that as a benchmark.
If you’re an average, single middle income earner and retire at that age now, you’ll get $17,532 from Social Security next year. That’s well above what the federal government considers the official poverty level for a single person: $12,060.
But here’s the thing: the federal poverty thresholds are so absurdly low, that many economists double them to get a more realistic level. So that $12,060 that the government calls poverty? It should really be $24,120, says economics professor Teresa Ghilarducci, one of the study’s authors.
“We base it on what we call the level of ‘economic deprivation,’” she says. And when you double it, it’s clear that millions of older Americans could slide into poverty when they retire.
The same ratios could apply for couples if both worked. But one partner could also collect a mere “spousal benefit” that’s just 50% of the other person’s.
Read: Why retirees should feel very worried right now
All these numbers can be confusing. Let me give you the bottom line: you’re not going to get much from Uncle Sam, and remember, depending on a variety of factors, parts of that Social Security can be taxed. In the end, many retirees will wind up sending a portion of their income right back to the government.
This is where other sources of retirement income, like pensions and personal savings, play a big role. That is, they WOULD play a big role, if people had them. As we’ve mentioned before, 91% of workers in their 50s don’t have a pension, and nearly half—46%—don’t participate in a retirement plan at work—not an IRA or 401(k), nothing.
Read: Opinion: Like Hoover and Dubya, will Trump eat his words about the economy?
The absence of assets in these two critical categories places added stress on Social Security. In millions of cases, it may prove to be the biggest source of income that some retirees have. This is a huge problem. Social Security was never meant to be a principal source of income—but merely a supplement to pensions and personal savings.
Read: What you probably don’t know about Social Security
You’re probably aware that there’s a terrible Catch-22 here. But it bears repeating. If you’re anxious to grab into Social Security as soon as you can because you need the money, you can do so at 62. But your monthly checks will be smaller. If you can afford to wait a few years, you get more—a lot more. Here’s what the Social Security Administration says:
If you were born in 1960 your full retirement age is 67.
If you begin taking Social Security at age 62, you’ll get 70% of the monthly benefit—because you retired five years before your full retirement age.
If you begin taking Social Security at age 65, you’ll get 86.7% of the monthly benefit—because you retired two years before your full retirement age.
If you wait until age 67—the full retirement age—you’ll get 100% of the monthly benefit.
If you have a spouse, there’s another set of numbers to consider, which you can read here.
Since you don’t want to slide into poverty, like the Schwartz Center predicts for many people, which path is best of for you? Most financial advisers would urge you to keep working as long as you can. Squeeze every last nickel and every last benefit out of your employer, and leave at 67, when your Social Security has fully blossomed. Meanwhile—and sorry to be a Scrooge here—slash your living expenses and save as much as you can. And recognize this: your living standards might not be what you once dreamed of or assumed.
There’s also this wildcard: What happens if Social Security is slashed 21% come 2034, like the government has warned? Do you want a 21% cut of the smaller, age 62 Social Security check, or a 21% cut of the bigger age 67 check? There’s always a chance that Social Security could be propped up—if you have confidence that our politicians, who can’t agree in anything, can agree on a solution. Me, I don’t have that confidence,
So many complications, and you should discuss them with an experienced financial adviser. But this much is clear: Avoiding poverty is your goal. How will you do it?"

","Au contraire. I’m a woman, and I know what country I would rather give birth in, and, no, it’s not the United States. All that money Americans spend isn’t buying us much at all. If Finland’s health-care system is what we get for “skimping” on women, sign me up.
AD

Finland beats the United States when it comes to childbirth on almost every measure. Its maternal death rate is among the lowest in the world, while the United States, at 14 deaths per 100,000 live births, ranks a lowly 46th, firmly in the lowest tier of developed countries. Our infant mortality rate is triple that of Finland. Almost one-third of babies in the United States are delivered by Caesarean section vs. 1 in 6 in Finland. Conditions in even top-notch U.S. teaching hospitals can be challenged, with women laboring in hallways and waiting rooms because there are no rooms available for them.
Americans pay lots of money for these dismal results. Yes, most people are not responsible for the $12,000 average bill for a typical vaginal birth. (A C-section runs just under $17,000.) But we are still usually out a four-figure sum. More than half of all those with employer-based insurance plans have a deductible of more than $1,000, so families find themselves on the hook for hefty chunk of that money. The average out-of-pocket cost to a mom from the beginning to the end of a pregnancy is just over $1,600 for a vaginal birth and almost $2,000 for a C-section.
As a result, posts on how to save money on giving birth are something of a personal-finance website staple, though the advice is usually limited to the useful information such as reminders that forgoing the epidural can save a new mom more than a thousand dollars and helpful reminders that “you’ll need to study your plan in-depth to understand your out-of-pocket costs.” I’ve had two children, and I assure you parsing my health-insurance policy is just about the last thing I wanted to do while experiencing morning sickness or chasing after a toddler while eight-months pregnant. (I also don’t recommend forgoing the epidural — I attempted that too.)
AD
AD
That’s not to say Finland’s heath-care system is problem-free. A comprehensive health-care reform undertaken to cut costs as the population ages is causing no small amount of political controversy. But most Finns remain happy with their system. And why wouldn’t they? There’s no question that Finland gets better results for much less money spent. The day before Sanders’s tweet, a “CBS This Morning” segment on the subject found it cost a mother less than $60 to have a baby in Finland, so long as she is covered by the country’s health-care system. No one is billed separately for a minimum number of ultrasounds or doctor visits. And did I mention the free baby sleep box with a mattress the Finnish government tosses in, which also includes clothes, toys, bath towels, mittens and a snowsuit?
All of this is separate from the fact that the United States does not mandate paid family leave for new parents; 25 percent of mothers of newborns are back on the job within two weeks. The cost of child care exceeds the cost of sending a child to a public university in a majority of states. In Finland, on the other hand, new mothers receive about 16 weeks off from work, while dads are granted about two months. Child care is subsidized too. Little wonder that a survey released Wednesday found Finland is the world’s happiest country. They value the health and welfare of their citizens. The United States? Not so much."

","NUHW is locked in a bitter, yearslong fight with Kaiser over mental health staffing levels in the health care provider’s California facilities. Therapists waged a statewide five-day strike in December, and a one-day work stoppage in Pasadena last month.
The National Union of Healthcare Workers plans to hold an informational picket line outside a Biden fundraiser slated for Wednesday in Los Angeles, according to Sal Rosselli, the union’s president. The fundraiser is to be held at the home of a director of the Kaiser Foundation , which operates hospitals as a subsidiary of Kaiser Permanente.
Former Vice President Joe Biden may consider himself a “ union man ,” but one California union won’t be giving him a warm welcome this week.
ASSOCIATED PRESS Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden won't get a warm welcome from a California union this week. The National Union of Healthcare Workers plans to picket a Biden fundraiser.
Rosselli told HuffPost his union first reached out to Biden last week about the fundraiser to be hosted by Dr. Cynthia Telles, a UCLA School of Medicine faculty member who sits on Kaiser’s board. According to an invitation, contribution levels for the event range from $250 per person to $2,800, which is the maximum contribution for the presidential primary allowed under election law.
Rosselli said the union has not heard back from the campaign.
“He should take our side in this dispute,” Rosselli said. “I think he should walk. He should cancel it.”
Neither the Biden camp nor Telles immediately responded to requests for comment.
The NUHW represents 3,500 psychologists and other workers at Kaiser facilities. The union has long alleged that Kaiser understaffs its mental health clinics, leading to long waits for vulnerable patients. The union has demanded that Kaiser hire more therapists and put pay and benefits on par with other employees in medical care.
“It doesn’t matter what [a patient’s] situation is,” one therapist told USC Annenberg Media in April. “They could be struggling with parenting, they could be going through bereavement, they could have a bipolar disorder. They’re still gonna have to wait three months.”
In a statement, Kaiser Permanente spokesperson John Nelson called the picket a “publicity stunt by union leadership disguised as a bargaining tactic.” He added that Kaiser was making progress toward a new contract with the union. “What’s so disappointing is that despite that alignment, union leadership has decided to engage in this unproductive behavior,” Nelson said.
The tiff over the California fundraiser is another sign of the trouble Biden may run into with the progressive left as he works his donor network.
The former veep kicked off his campaign with a show of union support last week, winning the endorsement of the International Association of Fire Fighters and speaking at a Teamsters hall in Pennsylvania. But as HuffPost reported, the early Democratic front-runner is bound to have a harder time rounding up the support of progressive unions uneasy with his centrist track record and corporate ties.
Some of his top opponents are already using that line of attack. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) criticized Biden last week, describing him as a friend to credit card companies. Meanwhile, the campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) took a shot at Biden for holding a fundraiser at the home of a Comcast executive.
Rosselli, whose union endorsed Sanders in the 2016 election, argued that Biden shouldn’t take money from Kaiser executives or board members until the health care provider resolves the dispute with the union amicably.
“I think he should step up and get a commitment,” Rosselli said.
This story has been updated with comment from Kaiser Permanente."

","Talk of Nike Inc. sales taking a hit from the company’s decision to put ex–NFL player Colin Kaepernick at the center of its latest “Just Do It” campaign is looking overblown, based on data from a Silicon Valley digital commerce research company.
After an initial dip immediately after the news broke, Nike’s NKE, +0.99% online sales actually grew 31% from the Sunday of Labor Day weekend through Tuesday, as compared with a 17% gain recorded for the same period of 2017, according to San Francisco–based Edison Trends.
“There was speculation that the Nike/Kaepernick campaign would lead to a drop in sales, but our data over the last week does not support that theory,” said Hetal Pandya, co-founder of Edison Trends.
Don’t miss: Here’s what Twitter data say about the Nike boycott
Nike’s stock has also held up after its initial slump. The stock rallied 2.2% on Monday and has retraced 93% of the decline to a three-week low that it suffered on Sept. 4, immediately after the campaign was revealed. It has gained 31% in 2018, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.85% , which since 2013 has counted Nike as a member, has gained 5%, as the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.95% has risen about 8%.
The news generated plenty of online buzz, with social engagement around Nike and Kaepernick rising sharply this week, according to 4C Insights, a marketing technology company. Mentions of and comments about Nike on social-media platforms rose 1,678% on Sunday and Monday, according to 4C data. Mentions of Kaepernick spiked 362,280%, the data showed.
The athlete has become the face of player protests against racial injustice and police brutality, since he started sitting and later kneeling during the national anthem, inspiring others to follow suit. The action has irked President Donald Trump, who weighed in on the Nike campaign in a series of tweets this week.

That didn’t deter Nike from airing its first TV ad of the campaign on Thursday. Narrated by Kaepernick, the ad includes appearances by other high-profile African-American athletes Odell Beckham Jr., LeBron James and Serena Williams. The ad urged people to follow their dreams and ignore naysayers.
“Calling a dream crazy is not an insult,” Kaepernick says in the Nike spot. “It’s a compliment.”
To be sure, Nike has taken some flak from customers who oppose the NFL player’s actions. Sentiment toward the brand dropped 38% on Sunday and Monday, according to 4C, but it’s not all bad news.

Nike’s most engaged audience persona is “Made it and Know it,” said 4C Chief Marketing Officer Aaron Goldman, one of 70 categories of consumers that 4C has identified by analyzing social-media engagement on a range of platforms. People in that bracket are generally successful in their careers and personal lives, are typically single with robust social lives, and like to spend money on entertainment and travel, as well as online streaming services.
“Racial equality is a top concern for this audience, along with causes like clean-water access and gun control,” Goldman said.
“ ‘You can be darn sure that Nike has done its research and knows what will move its product and who this campaign will resonate with. They are the ones [Nike has] decided will be its future customers, so, if others are getting upset, [Nike has] planned for that, and it doesn’t care.’ ” — Aaron Goldman, 4C Insights
Sentiment toward Kaepernick actually improved by 40% this week, he said.
“You can be darn sure that Nike has done its research and knows what will move its product and who this campaign will resonate with,” said Goldman. “They are the ones [Nike has] decided will be its future customers, so, if others are getting upset, [Nike has] planned for that, and it doesn’t care.”
Daring to take a political stand has become a new paradigm for brands, as they seek to connect with a younger generation and changing political views, said Goldman.
“A company like Procter & Gamble PG, +3.14% that makes products for everyone from young to old, male and female, are not going to do something controversial that might alienate half their audience. But a company like REI can take a stance on national parks, because they know that is really important for their customers.”
The outdoor-pursuits retailer REI was one of the companies that hit back against Trump’s executive order late last year that would dramatically reduce the size of two national monuments in Utah.

Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel commended Nike for its “more edgy, risky” campaign, while refreshing the three-decades-old “Just Do It” slogan.
“The extensive roster of athletes and their powerful stories are core to the company’s stepped-up efforts in reaching a younger demographic,” Nagel wrote in a note earlier this week.
The Kaepernick campaign “is clearly an effective way to make some noise in the industry, regardless of any political bent. Over time, for Nike, we think the power of the messaging from this new broader campaign is apt to overshadow any potential backlash, near term, in our view,” Nagel wrote.

","In his prayer at the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem last week, a prayer delivered against a backdrop of violence in Gaza, the evangelical pastor Robert Jeffress said Donald Trump was a moral leader who stood “on the right side of you, O God”.
Half a world away, outside the Capitol in Washington, the Rev William Barber led a moment of silence for the 60 Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers.
As one group of faith leaders celebrates the fruits of a decades-long alliance with the Republican party, another is mounting a multi-faith challenge to the dominance of the Christian right, in an attempt to recapture the moral agenda.
“There is no religious left and religious right,” Barber, a pastor and political leader in North Carolina, told the Guardian. “There is only a moral center. And the scripture is very clear about where you have to be to be in the moral center – you have to be on the side of the poor, the working, the sick, the immigrant.”
Frustrated by conservative Christians’ focus on culture wars over issues such as abortion and gay marriage, Barber leads an ascendent grassroots movement that is trying to turn the national conversation to what they believe are the core teachings of the Bible: care for the poor, heal the sick, welcome the stranger.
The Poor People’s Campaign, a revival of Martin Luther King’s final effort to unite poor Americans across racial lines, last week brought together activists from several faiths, the Women’s March, the labor movement and other liberal organizations to launch 40 days of civil disobedience and protest against inequality, racism, ecological devastation and militarism. As many as 1,000 people were arrested during the first wave. More expect to be held in future.
Barber, a co-chair of the campaign, says some conservative faith leaders have “cynically” interpreted the Bible’s teachings to demonize homosexuality, abortion, scientific facts and other religions. They are guilty, he says, of “theological malpractice” and “modern-day heresy”.
There is no religious left and religious right. There is only a moral center Rev William Barber
Religious conservatives are listening to Barber’s criticism. On occasion, they have returned fire. After he excoriated a group of conservative ministers for praying for Trump at the White House and accused them of not caring for the poor, the pastors held a press conference and suggested Barber visit their churches.
“They say so much about the issues where the Bible says so little,” Barber said, repeating a refrain he often deploys to criticize the religious right. “But they speak so little about the issues where the Bible says so much.
“Jesus set up free healthcare clinics everywhere he went. He healed everybody and never charged a leper a co-pay.”
He reserves particular contempt for politicians who rely on racial dog whistles, voter suppression and gerrymandering.
“Slavemaster religion had a strange morality that somehow you could worship on Sunday and still have slaves on Monday,” he said. “But as we would say today, those preachers were not practicing religion. They were practicing racism under the cover of religion. We still see some of that today.”
‘We are surely trying to impact politics’
The demands of the Poor People’s Campaign are as ambitious as they are progressive. They have called for a repeal of the Republican tax cuts, federal and state minimum wage laws and universal single-payer healthcare. Other proposals also mirror those of politicians like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
“We are surely trying to impact politics,” said Liz Theoharis, a co-chair. “And we are surely trying to make sure that our elected officials take these issues seriously. But this goes far beyond any one election or election year.”
Barber and Theoharis imagine a new “southern strategy” that undoes racial divisions. For months they have barnstormed poor and working-class communities deep in Trump country, in an effort to build a multi-faith alliance.
These issues are not seen as progressive or Democratic. They’re seen as human rights issues Liz Theoharis
“We visited homes where there was raw sewage in their yard,” Theoharis said. “In these communities, these issues are not seen as progressive or Democratic. They’re seen as human rights issues.”
Daniel Schultz, a writer at Religion Dispatches and a minister in the United Church of Christ, has long argued that the left is ill-equipped to rival the Christian conservatives’ alliance with Republicans. He believes progressive people of faith would be better served by a model like Indivisible, which trains local activists to resist Trump’s agenda.
“Rev Barber has a great moral message,” he said, “but I don’t want the next Democratic candidate for president to feel he has to kiss his ring to get elected.”
Nonetheless, the religious right helped deliver the White House to Trump, a thrice-married billionaire accused of sexually harassing more than a dozen women and of paying off a porn star over an alleged sexual encounter. They are seeing results.
Trump has moved the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, which many evangelicals believe accords with biblical prophecy. He has installed several judges and a supreme court justice who appear likely to advance anti-abortion causes. He also ended taxpayer funding for clinics that facilitate abortions, moved to restrict transgender people from serving in the military and strengthened the ability of religious leaders to preach politics from the pulpit.
That string of victories is a reminder of how hard Trump is working to keep the support of Christian conservatives ahead of this year’s midterms.
And yet Trump’s policies on immigration, healthcare and the environment are also mobilizing faith-based activists on the left. The Poor People’s Campaign wants to kickstart a voter mobilization effort. It does not plan to endorse candidates or join forces with any party. But it certainly hopes to gain political sway.
“This isn’t just about the next 40 days,” Barber said. “This is about building a movement that lasts.”
Sister Simone Campbell, a liberal Catholic activist who supports the campaign, said she feared the movement’s broad demands may be an obstacle to building long-term cohesion. But, she said, “they’re trying to create a counter-energy that can make a difference.
“I’m a person of faith so I live in hope.”"

","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is considering bypassing Congress to grant a $100 billion tax cut mainly to the wealthy, a legally tenuous maneuver that would cut capital gains taxation and fulfill a long-held ambition of many investors and conservatives.
Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in an interview on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina this month that his department was studying whether it could use its regulatory powers to allow Americans to account for inflation in determining capital gains tax liabilities. The Treasury Department could change the definition of “cost” for calculating capital gains, allowing taxpayers to adjust the initial value of an asset, such as a home or a share of stock, for inflation when it sells.
“If it can’t get done through a legislation process, we will look at what tools at Treasury we have to do it on our own and we’ll consider that,” Mr. Mnuchin said, emphasizing that he had not concluded whether the Treasury Department had the authority to act alone. “We are studying that internally, and we are also studying the economic costs and the impact on growth.”
Currently, capital gains taxes are determined by subtracting the original price of an asset from the price at which it was sold and taxing the difference, usually at 20 percent. If a high earner spent $100,000 on stock in 1980, then sold it for $1 million today, she would owe taxes on $900,000. But if her original purchase price was adjusted for inflation, it would be about $300,000, reducing her taxable “gain” to $700,000. That would save the investor $40,000."

","As federal authorities crack down on the far right after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, the movement’s leaders have found new sources of suspicion: each other.
In the Trumpist “America First” movement and the far-right paramilitary group the Proud Boys, alliances are fracturing as extremists brand each other as potential informants. Now racist live-streamers are accusing their former comrades of attempting to turn over followers to law enforcement, while Proud Boys chapters are splintering from the national organization over similar fears.
Until the FBI started closing in, white nationalists Nick Fuentes and Patrick Casey were the two most prominent figures in the racist “America First” movement.
The pair built up shared audiences on live-streaming platforms, and cheered as their fans, nicknamed “groypers” after an obese version of the cartoon Pepe the Frog, heckled more moderate Trump allies at conservative events.
But the federal heat is on after Fuentes received roughly $250,000 in a much-scrutinized bitcoin transfer, then appeared outside the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot. The FBI is reportedly investigating the bitcoin transfer, though Fuentes has not faced charges over the money or the riot.
On Thursday, Casey distanced himself from Fuentes and America First in a live-streamed video, slamming Fuentes’ decision to gather his followers in Orlando later this month for a conference right as other America First supporters face charges over the riot.
“Some people who were at the Capitol are going to flip,” Casey said in his video.
Declaring the aftermath of the Capitol riot “a million times worse” for the far right than the crackdown that followed the fatal white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in 2017, Casey claimed, without offering evidence, that Fuentes’ bank accounts have been frozen by federal authorities. He also accused Fuentes of planning to drive cross-country, rather than fly, to the Florida conference because he suspected he was on the federal no-fly list, then concealing that possibility from his followers.
Worst of all, Casey argued, Fuentes planned to gather all of his supporters in Orlando, where they could be easily recorded by federal investigators or informants. He went on to suggest America First’s members would see the conference for what he thinks it could be: an FBI trap.
“He wants you to give him your real name, to show up to his event where your face will be visible, where your cellphone data will be in close proximity to his,” Casey said.
Fuentes didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Accusations that one-time allies have become federal informants aren’t uncommon in the extreme right, which has built up an entire lexicon of terms to describe the varieties of real or suspected federal infiltrators. But that paranoia has been ratcheted up in the aftermath of the riot, with the Proud Boys—a group that has seen a slew of members indicted—splintering under accusations that leaders have become informants or otherwise been compromised by the FBI.
Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was arrested in Washington, D.C., two days before the riot, and now faces felony charges over the possession of illicit firearm magazines. But a Reuters report on Tarrio’s history as a federal informant cast members’ suspicions on their own leader, even as Proud Boys who allegedly participated in the riot face federal conspiracy charges.
Proud Boys chapters in three U.S. states—including four local chapters in Indiana—now claim to have broken with the national organization over Tarrio’s work as a federal informant. (Tarrio did not return a request for comment.)
“We reject and disavow the proven federal informant, Enrique Tarrio, and any and all chapters that choose to associate with him,” read a statement shared by the Indiana group’s state-level Telegram channel and on the Alabama group’s website, previously reported by USA Today. “We do not recognize the assumed authority of any national Proud Boy leadership including the Chairman, the Elders, or any subsequent governing body that is formed to replace them until such a time we may choose to consent to join those bodies of government.”
Proud Boys in Oklahoma also broke from Tarrio’s leadership, issuing a statement on messaging app Telegram in which they accused him and other national “elders” of “failure to take disciplinary measures [which] have jeopardized our brothers safety and the integrity of our brotherhood.”
Tarrio responded to the Oklahoma chapter’s departure with a series of memes accusing Oklahomans of being rednecks, or having sex with relatives. Anti-Tarrio Proud Boys responded with their own memes accusing their former leader of ratting out members of the group, photoshopping his face on rapper and government witness Tekashi69. Another meme played on the menacing Proud Boys motto “Fuck Around and Find Out,” claiming that Tarrio would instead “Snitch Around and Rat Out.”
But don’t expect Proud Boy splinter groups to morph into peaceful book clubs. The Indiana Proud Boys, for example, are led by Brien James, a longtime member of white supremacist groups with a history of violent brawls. Other white supremacists have previously slammed James as a law enforcement risk (someone “you want to keep away from you because you know he’s going to do something to bring the cops over,” one previously noted). Nevertheless, James took to Telegram this week to blame Tarrio and Ethan “Rufio Panman” Nordean, a prominent Proud Boy who was arrested on Feb. 3 over his own alleged role in the riot, of being untrustworthy.
“ He claimed he’d tried to transfer the trademark to another Proud Boy, who got spooked after Canada slapped the group with a terrorist label. ”
“Now we have another ‘war boy’ and elder who is trying to snitch on the president? For something he knows damn well the president didn’t do? You made your own choices Rufio,” James wrote, adding that “if you are a Proud Boy I would recommend having your chapter declare full autonomy from the national structure at the very least.” (A public defender listed as representing Nordean did not respond to a request for comment.)
The Capitol riots have been followed by still more rifts internationally.
Anti-fascist activists in Manitoba, Canada, also claim their province’s Proud Boys chapter has dissolved. The CBC reported that, while the chapter had been largely inactive for the past year, the group was confirmed dead this month, when the Canadian government designated Proud Boys as a terrorist organization.
Meanwhile, Jason Lee Van Dyke, who registered the group’s trademark and briefly led the Proud Boys in 2018, filed this week to surrender the trademark to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, legal documents show. Van Dyke previously told The Daily Beast he revoked Tarrio’s license to use the name after a Black church in Washington, D.C., sued the Proud Boys for allegedly burning their flag in a rally weeks before the Capitol attack.
“I don’t want any recourse or anyone thinking I have any control over this group, that I have anything to do with this group, or that I am going to have anything to do with this group in the future,” Van Dyke said in a separate interview this week. He claimed he’d tried to transfer the trademark to another Proud Boy, who got spooked after Canada slapped the group with a terrorist label.
“There was one individual… who contacted me about having the trademark transferred to him,” Van Dyke told The Daily Beast. “After the Canadian government made a determination of the Proud Boys as a terrorist group for whatever reason they did that, that individual told me he was out and he would not be taking over the trademark. My response to that individual and those who had been working with him on acquiring the trademark was that they had seven days to get back to me regarding who was going to take it over, or I was going to surrender it.
“I did not hear back from anybody and the trademark is surrendered.”
As for the America First movement, Casey’s criticism of Fuentes has riled the “groypers,” who have been forced to choose between their two leaders. Fuentes appeared to respond to Casey on Thursday night by tweeting a video of Donald Trump talking about disloyalty.
But Fuentes’ supporters and allies have good reason to believe federal law enforcement is focusing on their group. Anthime Gionet, a Fuentes ally who goes by the alias “Baked Alaska,” was arrested in January after filming himself entering the Capitol. Riot suspect Riley June Williams, who wore an “I’m With Groyper” shirt to the Capitol, allegedly stole a laptop computer from Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).
Casey urged his followers to consider how they would react to Fuentes’ conference if any other far-right leader had been behind it.
“You would be like, ‘Wow, federal honeypot, federal honeypot event,’” Casey said. “You would probably accuse the guy of being a fed.”"
demsocialist,"https://www.lawfareblog.com/how-hard-it-overturn-american-election
","And so it has come to this: The president of the United States is trying to overturn the results of a national election he unambiguously lost with a combination of petulant whining, spiteful and flailing executive action, and magic.
No, it’s not ultimately going to work, at least not if working is defined as allowing President Trump to maintain power in the face of expressed voter will.
But it is working better than I would have believed possible: in undermining confidence in American democratic processes, in damaging President-elect Joe Biden’s ability to govern in the short term, and in raising questions in the minds of the faithful as to whether Trump’s defeat was real.
The president’s gambit starts with his refusal to concede an election that is significantly less close than the one he won four years ago and which he declared a “landslide.” There exists no law or rule that compels a president to acknowledge the legitimacy of his defeat—or even the fact of it—except in the very limited sense that he has to vacate the office. The attempt to continue occupying the White House after noon on Jan. 20, after all, would certainly constitute trespassing and might even constitute sedition to the extent it was intended illegally to hold power. (“If two or more persons ... conspire to overthrow ... the Government of the United States ... or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.”)
So yes, the president is allowed to sulk. He is allowed to be the sorest of sore losers. He is allowed to once again display before the entire world the complete triumph of ego over patriotism, of self-interestedness over public-spiritedness, within his heart. There is, actually, nothing to do about it if he wants to play it this way; there is no way to stop him. And in and of itself, it’s not even a particularly grave problem. It is certainly sad that the United States has a president who so completely fails the basic tests of honor and decency. It would be lovely to see him just once rise to some occasion, any occasion. But it’s hardly a surprise that he can’t or he won’t or he doesn’t want to. He is, after all, Donald Trump.
The bigger problem than the president’s refusal to concede the race is the toleration of that refusal by the overwhelming majority of congressional Republicans. Yes, a few senators—Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney and Ben Sasse—have congratulated Biden, and a few others have said that Biden should have access to transition resources and intelligence briefings.
But the Republican leadership in both houses of Congress have played along with the president’s obstinate refusal to face reality, pretending that there are still important questions about the integrity of the vote to litigate and resolve. “Let’s not have any lectures, no lectures, about how the president should immediately, cheerfully accept preliminary election results from the same characters who just spent four years refusing to accept the validity of the last election and who insinuated that this one would be illegitimate too if they lost again—only if they lost,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor. “Until the Electoral College votes, anyone who is running for office can exhaust concerns in counting in any court of appropriate jurisdiction,” he said in response to a reporter’s question.
Let’s leave aside the obvious factual problem with McConnell’s words: Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, in fact, promptly accepted the preliminary results of the 2016 election. Clinton did not launch a spree of frivolous lawsuits in an attempt to overturn them. Nor did Obama delay the beginning of the transition of power; indeed, he met with Trump at the White House immediately following Trump’s apparent victory. McConnell knows all this, so arguing the matter is pointless. He is providing cover fire for the president’s refusal to engage reality. And the president is capitalizing on the opportunity that McConnell and other congressional Republicans are providing.
This is where the matter goes from being one of mere personal petulance on the part of an incumbent who lost his bid for reelection into something more menacing. Because Trump is using state power to frustrate an orderly transition of power. Over the past few days:
If this list has you feeling a little anxious, it should. It’s a response to an electoral outcome on the part of a sitting president that is genuinely unprecedented in American history. As Bill Kristol asks in an article in the Bulwark:
[W]hat do we make of Mitch McConnell refusing to acknowledge the election results today? And of the two Georgia Republican senators attacking their (Republican) secretary of state, with no basis in fact? And of the Republican governor of Georgia echoing those attacks? And of Attorney General Bill Barr announcing a Justice Department willingness to investigate if there are “allegations” (even, apparently, if no evidence) of election irregularities. Are we 100 percent certain this doesn’t soften the ground enough so that what seems almost unthinkable now becomes thinkable? Are we 100 percent certain the state legislature in, say, Georgia, won’t start considering things that now seem outside the realm of the possible? And if the unthinkable actually happens in Georgia, are we certain that it could not then happen in Wisconsin? And Pennsylvania?
Such anxiety has sensible people asking questions about coups and election thefts. And it’s hard to be quite as dismissive of such talk as I would like to be and as such rhetoric normally warrants. The president, after all, is actively threatening not to respect the results of a clear electoral defeat. He is taking steps consistent with that refusal, including the installation of partisan loyalists in senior positions in the Defense Department, and the overwhelming response of his political party—for whatever reason—is to humor his course of action, to tolerate it, or to actively to back his rejection of democracy’s verdict on his presidency. In such circumstances, Kristol is asking the right question. And his answer to that question—that things will probably be okay but that we need to be vigilant in defense of democracy—is not alarmism, though he embraces the term. It’s just good democratic hygiene.
That said, I want to stress the part here that Kristol acknowledges but does not emphasize: It is exceedingly difficult to steal an election in the United States. And while I agree with Kristol that “complacency in the defense of democracy is no virtue,” it is worth emphasizing the key bulwarks, so to speak, that operate to protect Biden’s win. They are robust.
First, there are a set of processes currently in operation to count and certify the votes. The margins here, while close, are not plausibly within the range that a recount may be likely to upset. As of this writing, according to the New York Times, Biden leads in states where victory would bring him to 306 electoral votes. These leads include the following margins:
47,710 votes in Pennsylvania
14,111 votes in Georgia
12,813 votes in Arizona
36,726 votes in Nevada
20,539 votes in Wisconsin
148,645 votes in Michigan
These are close margins in electoral terms, but with the possible exception of Arizona (where it is unclear how many votes are outstanding or the extent to which they may favor Trump), they are not vulnerable margins. Without outside interference, Georgia will certify its result on Nov. 20, after a hand recount ordered today; Pennsylvania and Michigan will certify their results on Nov. 23, according to Ballotpedia. Arizona will follow on Nov. 30, Wisconsin and Nevada a day later.
Could litigation interfere with these certifications? Theoretically, sure. But so far, anyway, no lawsuit has been filed that even colorably calls into question any result in any state—though the latest one in Pennsylvania does seek to enjoin the certification of the results. And plaintiffs have made exactly zero headway in court in challenging the integrity of the election. A key “whistleblower” in Pennsylvania turned out to be a fraud. Dead voters in Michigan turned out to be alive and eligible to vote—or not voters at all. There simply is no viable legal claim here that might flip states. And unlike in Florida in 2000, the margins are not close enough that a recount could flip the result depending on precisely how the state conducts it.
Note that exactly none of the officials responsible for counting these votes reports to Donald Trump. Note as well that the officials who do report to Trump are not responsible for counting votes. So while Barr can enrage Justice Department officials by making it easier for federal officials to investigate voter fraud allegations quickly, by his own memo’s admission, he still would need a plausible allegation of sufficient magnitude to make a difference to get involved before certification—and his involvement would not remove the authority of state officials to count and certify their votes in any case. Pompeo, for his part, can joke all he wants about a second Trump administration, but the secretary of state has no role in the electoral process at all.
Could an official in some state go rogue and, say, refuse to certify the results? I suppose it’s possible. But remember that Biden depends on no single state’s electoral vote anyway, and some of the key officials in some of the states are Democrats.
When certification happens, the Biden electors will have been, well, elected. And on Dec. 14, when the Electoral College formally votes, they will thus get to cast their votes for president. There will inevitably be talk of the possibility of faithless electors, but it’s not going to happen. For one thing, the Supreme Court clarified this year that states can bind their electors to vote as the voters did, and many states do this. More importantly, electors are party activists and loyalists. Which group of such Democratic activists do you imagine is going to stab Biden in the back by flipping to Trump?
The more realistic possibility is that Republican state legislatures might intervene to appoint their own slates of Trump electors. Many commentators have tossed off this possibility casually as though it’s a simple act a partisan legislature might contemplate. But it’s not an easy thing to do, even in one state—let alone in several. There are state law obstacles in some states, to start. And as Lawrence Lessig and Jason Harrow argued in Lawfare recently, such a move may also run afoul of the same recent Supreme Court precedent that allows states to bind their electors. Perhaps most importantly, the Electoral Count Act gives priority to any electoral votes cast under rules established in advance of the election—meaning that if a state legislature were to send its own slate of electoral votes to Congress to compete with those reflecting the popular vote, the national legislature should accept the latter. As Scott Anderson explains, this rule is not absolute; Congress has the authority to count the votes as it pleases. The point is that it is by no means a simple matter legally or politically for a state legislature to overturn the results of an election.
Notably, there does not seem to be a serious state legislative groundswell to try. In Pennsylvania, a group of Republican state legislators have called for an audit of the vote before certification, but the legislative Republican leadership has so far shown no interest in supplanting the electoral vote slate or stopping the count. In Georgia too, while the state’s two senators have called on the secretary of state to resign—and the governor has piled on—there seems to be no legislative action and certification will follow hard on the heels of the hand recount ordered today. A state legislator proposed a legislative slate of electors in Wisconsin, but the idea seems to have gained no traction. In Michigan, legislators are investigating the vote and even issued a subpoena, but so far that’s as far as it’s gone. There is little sign that I have discerned of state legislative machinations, at least so far, in Arizona. And Nevada’s legislature is controlled by Democrats, who would presumably be uninterested in handing the election to Trump.
Critically, any such effort in any state will confront an overwhelming political obstacle: an electoral result reflecting no substantial evidence of fraud. The New York Times reports that it “contacted the offices of the top election officials in every state on Monday and Tuesday to ask whether they suspected or had evidence of illegal voting. Officials in 45 states responded directly to The Times. For four of the remaining states, The Times spoke to other statewide officials or found public comments from secretaries of state; none reported any major voting issues.”
In other words, to appoint a pro-Trump slate of electors, a state legislature would have to proceed in the face of (1) a known popular vote that went for Biden by some thousands of votes, (2) official certification of that result by the elected officials of the state, (3) public statements by responsible state officials conceding that the election had not seen substantial irregularities, let alone fraud, (4) court actions rejecting challenges to any claims of fraud, (5) in some states, state law obstacles to such a course, (6) possible federal constitutional law obstacles to such a course, and (7) the clear preference in federal statute for electoral votes certified under rules established in advance of the election.
It would be, in other words, a very heavy lift. And Republicans would have to pull it off in at least two states in order to get Trump across the finish line.
In short, the harm here is almost certainly not the threat to the fact of the transition of power. Every day that goes by, more votes come in, and states get closer to certification of results that have their own logic and momentum and will lead to Biden’s taking the oath of office on Jan. 20.
The harm here, rather, has several dimensions.
First, it is a harm to the orderly transition of power. Merely raising the specter of not honoring the results of an election, merely inducing democratic anxiety such that as serious-minded a person as Bill Kristol could write a piece like the one quoted above, is a democratic harm. Denying information to the Biden transition makes it harder to govern coming in. Conveying uncertainty to foreign actors is dangerous; it invites misunderstanding, and misunderstanding can be deadly.
Second, like so many aspects of Trump’s presidency, Trump’s response to the election has unsettled public expectations of what it means to lose a presidential election in the United States, what a patriotic transition looks like and what outgoing presidents owe to their successors—and to the public. This is that old, pesky issue of norms. And once again, Trump is showing that presidential behaviors taken for granted are actually voluntary acts on the part of successive holders of the office—things that presidents do because they’re the things presidents have always done.
But what happens some years down the line when an election is a little bit closer than this one, the evidence of voting irregularities is a little bit better, and the legal questions are a little less open and shut? What lesson will some future president take from Trump’s behavior now and his party’s support for it?
Third, the president’s behavior will undermine trust among many people in the integrity of the election. It already has. An astonishing 70 percent of Republicans polled by Morning Consult report not believing the election was free and fair. Sustained campaigns to undermine trust run by entire political movements tend to work. And Biden will suffer from a lost perception of legitimacy among a major segment of the electorate as a result of this one.
Finally, fourth, there’s the chance that I’m wrong that Biden’s prevailing in the election’s aftermath—that the automatic processes I have described are just a little bit less automatic than I think they are. There’s the chance that Republicans, having dug themselves into the Trump hole, don’t stop digging when the results are certified, that they don’t quite know how to back down. There’s the chance that state legislatures are little more aggressively partisan than I imagine, or that a few courts go off the deep end.
There’s a chance, in other words, that things spin out of control.
This chaos factor is one of the reasons leadership is so important. And it’s why failures of leadership, even when they seem to be relatively harmless posturing worth tolerating, are so dangerous."

","“Bernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grassroots donations — both in the primary and in the general” elections, Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said. “Media elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.”
The third quarter was Sanders' most successful fundraising period of his 2020 campaign. He raised about $18 million in each of the first two quarters of the year.
Sanders' aides said the second best fundraising day of the year was Monday, when Sanders announced a plan to tax high-earning CEOs in an effort to reduce the widening gap between the nation's rich and poor.
Though Shakir did not mention Warren by name, his statement could be interpreted as a reference in part to Sanders' 2020 opponent, who said she would not participate in big-money fundraisers in the primary but would not unilaterally disarm against Trump in a general election. Sanders has sworn off high-dollar fundraisers for the entire campaign.
Sanders' team said he also transferred an extra $2.6 million from his other campaign accounts, but that figure is not included in the reported haul of $25.3 million."

","Sen. Bernie Sanders has confirmed to VPR that he is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
His official announcement video was posted online Tuesday morning.
""I wanted to let the people of the state of Vermont know about this first,"" Sanders told VPR's Bob Kinzel. ""And what I promise to do is, as I go around the country, is to take the values that all of us in Vermont are proud of — a belief in justice, in community, in grassroots politics, in town meetings — that's what I'm going to carry all over this country.""
Listen to Bob Kinzel's interview with Sen. Bernie Sanders above.
Sanders said he is running to oppose President Donald Trump, and to enact many of the progressive ideas — including universal health care coverage, a $15 minimum wage and reducing student debt — that he championed in 2016.
""I think the current occupant of the White House is an embarrassment to our country,"" Sanders said. ""I think he is a pathological liar... I also think he is a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, somebody who is gaining cheap political points by trying to pick on minorities, often undocumented immigrants.""
Sanders said his campaign hopes to enlist one million people in a ""grassroots movement of people prepared to stand up and fight.""
Sanders acknowledged he will encounter a ""very different campaign,"" than in 2016, when he emerged as the sole serious challenger to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and won 23 primaries and caucuses.
A diverse Democratic field includes more than a dozen candidates who have either formally declared or expressed serious interest. The challengers include five of Sanders' colleagues in the U.S. Senate — Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren.
When asked by VPR's Bob Kinzel about concerns that he no longer best represents ""the face of the new Democratic Party,"" Sanders, 77, said:
""We have got to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender and not by their age,"" Sanders said. ""I mean, I think we have got to try to move us toward a non-discriminatory society which looks at people based on their abilities, based on what they stand for.""
Sanders also touted his health and ""energy level.""

A Second Attempt To Be President
VPR reporter Bob Kinzel spoke to VPR ""Morning Edition"" host Mitch Wertlieb on Tuesday morning about Sen. Bernie Sanders' decision to run for president again.
Sanders is returning to the stage with a much different national profile than when he announced his first presidential bid back in 2015. VPR spoke with political scientists who discussed both how that could benefit Sanders in another run, as well as challenges that may present this time around.

Allegations of sexism and sexual harassment against members of the 2016 Sanders' campaign have also surfaced in recent weeks. Since the 2016 election we've seen the rise of the #MeToo movement, and those conversations are likely to continue throughout this presidential election season.
""We are gonna be providing a whole lot of education ... and training to all of our employees, and we have on board as part of this campaign a very, very experienced and professional team of folks who do exactly this — they deal with sexual harassment and discrimination,"" Sanders told VPR.

","“Right now I am focused on seeing that Biden is elected president,” he told POLITICO. “That’s what my main focus is.”
Former Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said Sanders has not talked directly with anyone on the Biden campaign about a future role, but plans to push Biden, his former Senate colleague, to ""include progressive voices"" in both the transition and in a potential new administration.
Yet two other people close to Sanders, including one former aide, said the senator has expressed interest in being in the administration, should Biden win in November. Sanders has been making his push for the top job at the Labor Department in part by reaching out to allies on the transition team, one person familiar with the process said.
When asked about Sanders’ potential role, a spokesperson for Biden’s transition team repeated the transition's stock line: that they are “not making any personnel decisions pre-election.”
Since ending his second bid for the Democratic nomination earlier this year, Sanders has thrown his support behind Biden, hitting the campaign trail for him in Michigan and New Hampshire, collaborating with him to create “unity task forces” to make recommendations on everything from health care to climate change, and taking the stage at the Democratic National Convention to urge progressives to back the former vice president.
“He’s 100 percent in Joe Biden’s court,” said Shakir. “We’ve had a good working relationship with the Biden team and I expect we’ll maintain that all the way through.”
Through this collaboration, Shakir said, Sanders has been able to influence both policy and personnel discussions underway among Biden transition's staff.
“It would be great to have a unity government that takes into account that progressives are a pretty healthy portion of the electorate,” he said. “Heeding that would be good, but if Joe Biden wins, he rightly has a mandate to move in whatever direction he chooses.”
The news of Sanders’ interest in the job is certain to cheer the Democratic left, which has been pushing for progressives to take senior roles in a potential Biden administration.
“He’d be terrific,” said Robert Reich, a former Labor secretary in the Clinton administration.
Having Sanders in a senior post could also help balance out any consternation over more moderate picks — or even a Republican — that Biden’s team is already considering for other spots in the administration.
Sanders could find support from the labor movement as well, where union officials expect to have some influence over Biden’s pick to lead the DOL.
The Vermont senator — who throughout his decadeslong career has called for laws to raise the minimum wage and make it easier for workers to organize — won significant support from local unions and rank-and-file members in the 2016 Democratic primary race, even as most major national unions endorsed his rival Hillary Clinton.
In 2020, many major unions endorsed Sanders’ signature ""Medicare for All"" proposal — which would replace private insurance with a national single-payer system — saying the policy would help workers focus their bargaining power on wages and working conditions, rather than health benefits. When some unions came out against the policy, saying they didn’t trust the new government insurance program to offer as robust benefits as the private plans they secured through negotiations, Sanders added a provision empowering the National Labor Relations Board to make sure employers reinvested what they would save on health insurance in workers’ pay and other benefits.
“Obviously, he’s earned a lot of trust from working people across the country over the past many years,” one union official said.
The official added that joining a Biden administration could help the 79-year-old Sanders craft a legacy — “being able to help rebuild the economy in a way that works for working Americans after this pandemic.”
One person close to Sanders agreed that Sanders sees an opportunity to achieve long-held policy goals for the working class under Biden, adding: “He really does believe Biden wants to be a Roosevelt-like president.”
The Democratic presidential nominee has made labor a priority issue throughout his presidential campaign, emphasizing the need to strengthen and expand the right to join a union and rebuild America’s middle class. It’s an area where he’s fairly progressive and generally aligned with Sanders, who pledged as a presidential candidate to double union membership if elected.
Still, it could be an uphill battle for Sanders to secure the nomination at Labor or any other agency, in part because Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, would be able to appoint a temporary successor to his Senate seat.
Unlike governors in other states, who get to appoint successors to carry out the rest of the term, Scott would be required under Vermont law to hold a special election within six months of the seat becoming vacant. But even allowing Scott the opportunity to fill Sanders’ seat with a GOP lawmaker in the short term could potentially affect control of the Senate, depending on the results of November’s election.
Others see Sanders’ stubborn independence as a potential liability.
“Because of how he operates and works with other people, there’s a zero chance” of him getting tapped for the job, one person close to Sanders said. “He’s a Lone Ranger, to a fault.”
Other names that have been floated for Labor secretary in a Biden administration include Bill Spriggs, chief economist at the AFL-CIO and a Howard University economics professor; Sharon Block, a veteran of the DOL and Obama White House who is now executive director of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard University; Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.), a former union organizer and leader of Michigan’s Department of Energy, Labor and Economic Growth; and Seth Harris, the former deputy secretary of Labor in the Obama administration.
There has also been some discussion of Biden looking to appoint a union official to his Cabinet, possibly atop the DOL or the Department of Education.

","Police have come under fire across the U.S. for their handling of the protests.
Police departments across the country have come under fire for their handling of what were largely peaceful protests in the wake of George Floyd's death, which were, in part, against police brutality. In some cases, officials are now investigating alleged officer misconduct.
Yet for one man who says he was permanently blinded in his left eye after rubber bullets were allegedly shot at him, the internal investigations are not enough.
""They're treating us like we're attacking the country, when they're really attacking us as citizens,"" Jax Feldmann, a 21-year-old Denver resident, told ABC News.
Feldmann said he was leaving his friends' house on May 30 and was walking to his car at around 9:30 p.m. before he was allegedly shot. Earlier that day, the city had seen protests in the wake of Floyd's death. But by the time Feldmann had stepped out, he said the crowds had mostly dispersed. A curfew was in effect at 8 p.m. that evening.
He walked what he said was about 30 or 40 feet before seeing ""a truck full of cops"" drive around the corner.
Feldmann said he did not see anyone peacefully protesting, let alone being violent. But when he arrived at the corner of Grant Street and Colfax Avenue, he was, as he describes, suddenly shot in the eye.
""I can't really work my head around the fact that I wasn't even protesting, and I still got shot in the eye and now I'm blind,"" he said. ""I don't have any explanation as to why they did that and they haven't come forward with an explanation.""
Feldmann said that he learned on Thursday that in about a year or two, he will completely lose his eye and will need a prosthetic. The doctors gave him the choice to have more surgeries, but said at some point down the road, the outcome of losing his eye was inevitable, according to Feldmann.
Beyond the investigation, he wants to see actual change.
""This shouldn't happen to anyone whether you're a citizen or an actual criminal and something needs to be done about that ... I think we need to ban these non-lethal projectiles,"" he said.
A spokesperson for Denver police told ABC News there is ""an open investigation into that incident at this time.""
""As with all internal affairs investigations, they are overseen by the office of the independent monitor,"" the spokesperson said. When asked by ABC News if any officers had been placed on administrative leave or reassigned to non-field duties, the spokesperson did not respond to ABC News.
Protests in Denver were largely peaceful and continued steadily since Floyd's death on May 25, but in some instances police used pepper spray and projectiles on them.
A federal judge ruled on June 5 that the Denver Police Department must scale back its use of chemicals and projectiles in protests. Judge R. Brooke Jackson of U.S. District Court, District of Colorado, said some actions of ""what I hope and believe to be a minority of the police officers in Denver and the nation during recent days (and before) not only vis-a-vis persons of color but against peaceful protesters of all backgrounds have been disgusting.""
Denver police said it would comply with the order.
Rubber bullets, referred to as kinetic impact projectiles (KIPs), are made from a variety of materials including rubber, polyvinyl chloride, plastic or a composite including metal. A combination of these materials into one bullet, propelled at a fast velocity and in close proximity, can cause terminal injuries or serious long-term damage, according to experts.
Feldmann's case is not the only instance being investigated.
In New York, the Attorney General Letitia James is investigating the interactions between the NYPD and protesters. Los Angeles police have launched more than 50 investigations into officer misconduct.
Feldmann's mother, Tammy, is wondering why there is only an internal investigation and not criminal charges.
""It is very frustrating because if I would have done this to somebody, where would I be right now? I'd be in jail. I'd have charges pressed against me,"" she said.
Tammy Feldmann said she wants someone to be held accountable and wants an answer as to why police were using rubber bullets in the first place.
She described the damage to her son's eye.
""There's three layers to your eye. You have the sclera, you have the choroid and you have the retina. There was so much damage from the bullet that it shredded all three layers so they're no longer connected and they can't fix it,"" his mother said.
""So when Jax was given the option of a surgery, what the surgery was to remove all the blood that was in the back and front of his eye. The pain could be very intense to do that. Or we could do the other option, which is to let the blood just dissipate on its own because he's not gonna have sight,"" she continued.
Tammy Feldmann called her son's decision to do the latter ""heart-wrenching.""
Birk Baumgartner, an attorney representing Feldmann, said they are taking steps to file a lawsuit against the City of Denver.
""This is not some garden variety of officer misconduct. This is a criminal assault causing serious bodily injury,"" Baumgartner said. ""There is no doubt this is a criminal act and an intentional act, and the city is not investigating as such. That shows what their real intentions are towards Jax.""
A Sacramento woman said she’ll likely be blind in one eye after the police shot her with a rubber bullet, according to ABC Sacramento affiliate KXTV. A freelance photographer said she likely won't regain vision in her left eye after being shot with what she believes was a rubber bullet, according to the New York Times. A woman who attended a protest in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, told ABC News bones in her face were fractured.
Dr. Rohini Haar, an emergency physician, medical expert at Physicians for Human Rights, and Research Fellow at the Human Rights Center at UC Berkeley's School of Law, said that police are not required to report their use of these weapons.
Haar also said their irregular shape creates unpredictable trajectories and makes it so there's ""really no way to use them safely in the crowd control setting to disperse the crowd or target a single violent individual within a crowd.""
""Ultimately, what the narrative should be, is that these are weapons and should be considered dangerous,"" Haar added.

","Derek Thompson: Could you first give me a sense of what’s happening on the ground in Denmark? What do the streets look like?
Flemming Larsen: Denmark has nearly entirely closed down universities, schools, public institutions, restaurants, museums, cinemas. No assembly of more than 10 persons is allowed. The borders have been closed too.
Thompson: Denmark’s government has announced a very aggressive plan to help workers in the next few months. Tell me what it’s doing.
Larsen: Denmark’s government agreed to cover the cost of employees’ salaries at private companies as long as those companies do not fire people. If a company makes a notice saying that it has to either lay off 30 percent of their workers or fire at least 50 people, the state has agreed to take on 75 percent of workers’ salaries, up to $3,288 per month. (This would preserve the income for all employees earning up to $52,400 per year.)
The philosophy here is that the government wants companies to preserve their relationship with their workers. It’s going to be harder to have a strong recovery if companies have to spend time hiring back workers that have been fired. The plan will last for three months, after which point they hope things come back to normal.
Thompson: So the government is offering to pick up the tab for workers whose employment is threatened by the downturn. Couldn’t companies easily defraud the government and collect the money anyway?
Larsen: Maybe, but the workers compensated are not allowed to work in the period. Workers staying with the company do not receive the 75 percent compensation.
Thompson: Some American economists say the U.S. should copy Germany’s work-sharing plan, Kurzarbeit, in which workers’ hours are reduced and then the government takes on part of workers’ salaries. Is Denmark’s plan like that?
Larsen: Not exactly. In the German plan, the government and the employer share the cost of paying for work. Here, the government is paying companies for employees who are going home and not working. These workers are being paid a wage to do nothing. The government is saying: Lots of people are suddenly in danger of being fired. But if we have firing rounds, it will be very difficult to adapt later. This way, the company maintains their workforce under the crisis and people maintain their salaries. You are compensating people even though they have to go home.
Derek Thompson: The coronavirus will be a catastrophe for the poor
Thompson: I think I understand you, and I’m going to try to summarize, but tell me if this summary is wrong: Denmark is putting the economy into the freezer for three months. You’re saying: We know that all these people won’t be able to work for the next few months. It’s inevitable. Rather than do rounds of firing followed by rounds of hiring, which will delay the recovery, let’s throw the whole economy into a deep freezer, and when the virus winds down we can thaw it out and almost everybody will still be with the company they worked for in January."

demsocialist,"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxm84/200-homeless-residents-of-minneapolis-have-taken-over-a-sheraton-hotel
","More than 200 homeless residents of Minneapolis have taken over a former Sheraton hotel in a neighborhood where protesters have demonstrated in recent days, around ten blocks from where police killed George Floyd on May 25, according to an article in the Minnesota Reformer. In doing so, they've created a sanctuary space for those without shelter.
Last week, the killing of Floyd at the hands of four Minneapolis police officers sparked riots and fires across south Minneapolis, leaving its homeless and displaced even more vulnerable. Volunteers negotiated the take over of the hotel with the support of the hotel's owners on May 29, as an 8 p.m. curfew descended on the city that excluded its 8,000 homeless residents.

The shared living space has thus far been managed like a commune as residents are running their own meetings where they collectively determine their needs and wants, and communicate them with volunteers. There are no leaders and the take was sponsored by no organization.
“People are organizing themselves. It’s a space where the value system that people are bringing in here is very explicitly that we take care of each other,” Rosemary Fister, one of the volunteers, told a Minnesota Reformer reporter in a video posted on Twitter. “We are who we have right now, so that’s what we have to do and that’s what we’re good at.”
The hotel has been relinquished by its owners into the hands of volunteers, Fister told the Minnesota Reformer.
Many of the hotel's new residents arrived from a homeless encampment near the destruction of Minneapolis Third Precinct police station. That encampment has grown in recent months as coronavirus has shuttered other public spaces in the city, and homeless shelters have reached capacity.
On Twitter, volunteers said they have secured a stream of funding to cover the daily cost of the hotel rooms and food for the roughly 200 residents. At night, those on volunteer shifts keep watch over the perimeter of the hotel property, which sits on Lake Street, where dozens of restaurants and businesses have been burned and damaged in recent days.
“Volunteers are prepping rooms, doing laundry, sanitizing surfaces, serving food from the hotel bar, organizing supplies, providing round-the-clock medic support, providing harm reduction supplies, doing community defense around the perimeter, & generally just making sh*t happen,” a volunteer named Rachel tweeted on Monday.
The 136-room hotel is now at full capacity, with 115 homeless Minneapolis residents on its waiting list, according to organizers on Twitter.
The 4-story Sheraton hotel, previously popular among tourists and those traveling on business, overlooks downtown Minneapolis. Each room comes with a lounge, microwave, hairdryer and TV, according to the hotel’s website.
The hotel is not accepting reservations online at this time, and it remains unclear whether residents are staying for the short term or long haul, but organizers say they’re looking for additional hotels to shelter those on the waiting list."

","The protest comes after a gunman killed 22 people and wounded dozens of others at a Walmart store and a shopping center in El Paso on Saturday. Days earlier, two Walmart employees were fatally shot at a store in Southaven, Miss., and a former employee has been charged in the shooting.
AD

“There’s an intense irony that Walmart continues to sell guns despite the constant shootings in its stores,” said Kate Kesner, an e-commerce employee in San Bruno who helped organize the protest.
Organizers also started a Change.org petition to call on company executives to stop selling firearms. As of Wednesday evening, it had more than 38,000 signatures.
Randy Hargrove, a Walmart spokesman, said the company is encouraging workers to voice their opinions in other ways.
“There are more effective channels such as email or leadership conversations,” he said. “The vast majority of our associates who want to share their views are taking advantage of those options.”
AD
But Thomas Marshall, 23, category specialist at Walmart who helped organize the walkout, said that workers “no longer want to be complicit by working for a company that profits off the sale of firearms.”
AD
He accused Walmart of retaliating against him and Kesner by shutting down their company email and Slack accounts on Tuesday, after they sent a division-wide email to roughly 20,000 e-commerce employees urging to join their efforts. He said Wednesday that his account had been restored.
“If I didn’t do something today, I would be a party to making money off weapon sales,” Marshall said. “We’re trying to start a conversation.”
In San Bruno, about 40 employees stood outside Walmart’s building there for 15 minutes in a circle. They hung their heads in silence briefly and then asked anyone to speak out. Only a handful did so.
AD
Operations manager Tom Misner, 46, was one of them. He said Walmart can and should do something about the rash of gun violence.
In an interview he said he is a believer in the Second Amendment, but “I don’t understand how that has included weapons of mass destruction” like assault rifles. He said Walmart should use its influence to lobby Congress for better gun control laws. “Congress will not do anything,” he said.
AD
Marshall said some employees worried they might face consequences if they participated in the walkout. “People are really afraid for their jobs,” he said. “Walmart has a reputation for silencing dissent.”
Hargrove earlier declined to say whether employees would be penalized for taking part in the walkout. “There has been no discipline, and we’re not going to speculate on that further.""
AD
In recent years, a growing wave of workers has pushed back against the corporate policies at some of the nation’s largest tech and retail firms. Employees at Amazon, Google and Microsoft have called on management to stop selling facial recognition technology and other services to law enforcement agencies and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. (Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)
AD
In June, hundreds of Wayfair employees walked out to protest the sale of $200,000 worth of furniture to a Texas detention center that houses migrant children.
Walmart’s store employees have long called on the company to improve pay, benefits and scheduling practices. But this week’s efforts are among the first by corporate employees meant to pressure the company to change its practices. Walmart, which has 1.5 million workers, is the nation’s largest employer.
In addition to Wednesday’s walkout, employees encouraged their colleagues to call in sick on Tuesday in protest of the company’s gun policies, according to an email obtained by The Washington Post. Hargrove, the Walmart spokesman, said Marshall and Kesner were the only employees who had done so.
AD
Walmart, which is based in Bentonville, Ark., has tightened its gun policies over the years. It stopped selling handguns in 1993 and phased out assault-style rifles in 2015. Last year, it raised the minimum age for gun purchases from 18 to 21, two weeks after 17 students and teachers were killed in a shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla.
On Tuesday, chief executive Doug McMillon said in an Instagram post that the company will “work to understand the many important issues arising from El Paso and Southaven as well as those raised in the broader national discussion around gun violence.”"
demsocialist,"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/28/bernie-sanders-filibuster-delay-defense-veto-override-451697
","Under Senate rules, Sanders has the ability to keep the chamber in during the holiday week and likely mess with the campaign schedules of Sens. David Perdue (R-Ga.) and Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.). Those two face Jan. 5 runoff races for control of the Senate against Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, who are both campaigning on the $2,000 checks.
A source close to Sanders said the Senate races were a factor in his decision — part of a bid to keep Perdue and Loeffler in D.C. and focus the campaign on their position regarding the $2,000 checks. Sanders also threatened to shut down the government earlier this month if the coronavirus relief bill did not include direct payments; ultimately it included checks of up to $600 and the government stayed open, though now Trump wants to go much higher.
Though veto overrides can be filibustered, as Sanders plans to do, it is a rare procedural move because the veto override already requires 67 votes and the filibuster is simply a delay tactic, according to the Congressional Research Service.
Sanders said he hopes McConnell allows a vote on the checks on Wednesday.
“The American people are desperate, and the Senate has got to do its job before leaving town,” Sanders said. “It would be unconscionable, especially after the House did the right thing, for the Senate to simply leave Washington without voting on this.”
It’s not clear whether there are 60 votes in the Senate for the $2,000 checks, which would require at least 12 Republicans to join with the chamber’s 48 Democratic Caucus members. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer plans to try and force a vote on the House-passed bill Tuesday, though any one member of the Senate can object and many conservatives oppose that level of spending.
Still, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) endorsed the $2,000 checks on Monday night and some House Republicans supported it on the floor, demonstrating a split in the party over whether to give Trump the checks he’s demanding as he prepares to leave office in January."
demsocialist,"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/20/who-won-the-debate-winners-and-losers-116286
","What did we learn in the debate? We asked four POLITICO campaign reporters — Christopher Cadelago, Holly Otterbein, Elena Schneider and Alex Thompson — for their takeaways from the Nevada debate.
Who had the best night? Who had the worst night?
Otterbein: Warren dominated the night. Progressive activists said this was the Warren they knew and loved and have missed recently this primary. The question is, is it too late for that to matter? It might not be: Amy Klobuchar’s strong debate performance before New Hampshire’s primary helped earn her an unexpected third-place finish there.
Meanwhile, Bloomberg had a devastating night, and post-debate polls will show whether his support is as soft as his rivals believe it is. Many voters likely learned for the first time tonight that he endorsed former President George W. Bush for reelection, made offensive comments about women, used nondisclosure agreements to keep allegations of sexual harassment at his company quiet, and on and on.
Thompson: Warren clearly had a good night — but I think Sanders probably had the best night, given that he went on stage as the frontrunner and seemed to leave the stage as the frontrunner. Other rivals, realizing he is on a path to winning the nomination, lobbed more attacks than ever, but Sanders largely deflected them.
As for the worst night, Bloomberg learned that running for president is harder than it looks. The other candidates have been campaigning for the better part of a year and had participated in eight other debates before. Bloomberg hadn’t — and it showed. He did seem to get more comfortable after the first hour, so perhaps the next debate will be better.
Cadelago: Warren brought the fight and showed that she isn’t ready to go down quietly. Her almost prosecutorial exchanges with Bloomberg over his wealth and his company’s nondisclosure agreements with women will be replayed in debate highlights for years. Warren’s challenge will be how to carry forward her momentum and stay in the hunt until Super Tuesday — essentially, avoid being this year’s Chris Christie, whose big debate performance in 2016 is remembered for bringing down Marco Rubio more than it boosted him. Warren will have to coalesce some voters that are gravitating to Sanders.
As for Bloomberg, he’ll have to hope that what happened in Vegas stays in Vegas.
Schneider: Heartily agree with Chris here. Warren took on nearly every person on that stage, and she displayed the fight she’s talked about on the stump — but held in reserve, up until now, against her fellow Democrats.
But strikingly, though, Warren barely took direct aim at Sanders, who is the Democratic frontrunner in Nevada as well as the latest national polls."

","And do you know who’s to blame? Believe it or not, the downfall of the American health insurance system falls squarely on the shoulders of former President Richard M. Nixon.
In 1973, Nixon did a personal favor for his friend and campaign financier, Edgar Kaiser, then president and chairman of Kaiser-Permanente. Nixon signed into law, the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, in which medical insurance agencies, hospitals, clinics and even doctors, could begin functioning as for-profit business entities instead of the service organizations they were intended to be. And which insurance company got the first taste of federal subsidies to implement HMOA73 … *gasp* … why, it was Kaiser-Permanente! What are the odds? It’s all right here to read for yourself.
And to perfectly cement HMOA73 as the profiteering boondoggle that it actually was, the law Nixon mandated also included clauses that encouraged medical providers to not CURE afflictions, but to PROLONG them by only treating the symptoms. There’s no money to be made in CURING sickness. But the sky’s the limit when it comes to forcing people to endure repetitive doctor visits, endless (and often useless and redundant) tests, and … of course … let’s not forget the ever-increasing demand for American-made prescription drugs!
Have you noticed recently that the words “prolonged coma” and DEATH have wormed their way into the fast-spoken side-effects list of just about every new drug you see on television or hear on the radio? Death! From the medicine that’s supposed to cure you! You know what? I’ll take restless legs over DEATH.
So it’s an arms race between insurers, who deploy software and manpower trying to find claims they can reject, and doctors and hospitals, who deploy their own forces in an effort to outsmart or challenge the insurers. And the cost of this arms race ends up being borne by the public, in the form of higher health care prices and higher insurance premiums. Of course, rejecting claims is a clumsy way to deny coverage. The best way for an insurer to avoid paying medical bills is to avoid selling insurance to people who really need it. An insurance company can accomplish this in two ways, through marketing that targets the healthy, and through underwriting: Rejecting the sick or charging them higher premiums. See the pattern?"

","The partial federal government shutdown is pushing groups of federal employees to organize assistance for themselves in ways that they’ve never had to before. On Tuesday, Transportation Security Administration employees at Midway Airport staged a food distribution for themselves and their colleagues to pick up groceries donated by the Greater Chicago Food Depository. It’s the first of two such distributions they plan this week for Midway’s TSA staff, many of whom are required to continue working through the shutdown without receiving pay.
“I knew, being a union rep here, I knew I had to do something,” said Darrell English, vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 777, which he said represents about 400 TSA employees working at Midway. English said he contacted the depository to ask if they might help those employees who have been struggling to keep up with food expenses during the shutdown. Shortly after that, English said non-union management employees within Midway’s TSA office asked him if they might get assistance, too.
“I realized it’s not a union thing or a non-union thing, it was more of a humanitarian thing,” said English. “I couldn’t say no, [the union] couldn’t say no, because this is something that’s bigger than a union.”
English was one of roughly a dozen TSA employees who arrived early Tuesday morning at a logistics office center near Midway to help offload the truck of donated food from the depository. Two hundred boxes filled with non-perishable goods, such as canned beans and corn, spaghetti and rice, as well as boxes of fresh apples, oranges, and sweet potatoes, were loaded onto pallets and brought into TSA’s administrative offices.
TSA officers and administrative staff started streaming in just after overnight shifts ended at 8 a.m., to pick up a box of shelf-stable foods, a bag of produce, and a $25 gift card to Jewel Osco grocery stores. Before 9:30 a.m., demand was so strong that food depository staff ordered a second van of food to be loaded from headquarters and brought to the site.
“We didn’t know what to expect this morning,” said Kate Maehr, the depository’s executive director. This was the first special distribution of food donations that the depository has organized specifically for federal workers since the partial government shutdown began one month ago. Maehr said her organization is planning more.
“We are getting calls from other groups (of federal workers), including the Bureau of Prisons,” Maehr said. “But each group is really distinct in terms of their site and what they can handle in terms of security.” For the Bureau of Federal Prisons, depository employees said they will likely load up a truck of food boxes that those federal workers can distribute amongst themselves on Wednesday morning.
“There is food right now, and so, I don’t want people to panic,” said Maehr. “But long-term, this isn’t sustainable.”
The impasse between Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Washington, D.C. over legislation to end the shutdown did not appear to loosen on Tuesday. President Trump’s proposal to fund the government was rejected by Democrats in the House and Senate, over provisions that would place new limits on the country’s asylum program. If the shutdown continues through the end of the week, federal employees face the prospect of missing a second paycheck since the ordeal began 31 days ago.
“The car note, the gas, and the lights, they don’t take IOUs. And the rent. So it’s been stressful,” said Gloria Perez, a transportation security officer at Midway who volunteered to help distribute food to her coworkers after she finished her shift at the airport. Perez, a single mother who can only work part-time because of a heart condition, said this is not the first time she’s relied on donations from the depository. But she said it was the first time she needed the help while she was actually working.
Perez said she was grateful to pick up a box herself but also to have an opportunity to help her colleagues, some of whom she said must be feeling even more stress than she is.
“It feels good to know that we’re coming together as a team, we’re sticking together as a team, and we’re going to make it through it as a team,” said Perez.

","Just for a moment, however, let’s imagine the American system we might have if the better angels of our nature were to prevail.
Here, then, are some specific suggestions—and they are only just that, suggestions—for a framework that might help restore confidence and trust in our precious system of government:
An electoral system based on full participation. At age 18, you are automatically registered to vote. No photo ID, no residency tests, no impediments of any kind. Advances in technology can make this happen effortlessly. Yes, voting should be restricted only to American citizens. Strict protections against foreign meddling are also necessary.
Read: Voter suppression is the new old normal
The elimination of money in campaigns. Period. Elections, like military service—each is an example of duty, honor, and service to country—should be publicly funded. Can you imagine if we needed to rely on wealthy donors to fund the military? I know there are those who genuinely believe in privatizing everything. They are called profiteers.
Public service should not be a commodity, and elected officials should not have to rent themselves out to the highest bidder in order to get into (or stay in) office. If you want to restore trust in government, remove the price tag. I am fully aware that the Supreme Court has declared that “money is speech.” That’s nonsense. The day my wallet starts talking to me, I might reconsider that view. Until then, I believe that the pernicious influence of money on our elections must be removed.
The end of minority rule in our legislative and executive branches. The Great Compromise, as it was called when it was adopted by the Constitution’s Framers, required that all states, big and small, have two senators. The idea that Rhode Island needed two U.S. senators to protect itself from being bullied by Massachusetts emerged under a system that governed only 4 million Americans.
Today, in a nation of more than 325 million and 37 additional states, not only is that structure antiquated, it’s downright dangerous. California has almost 40 million people, while the 20 smallest states have a combined population totaling less than that. Yet because of an 18th-century political deal, those 20 states have 40 senators, while California has just two. These sparsely populated, usually conservative states can block legislation supported by a majority of the American people. That’s just plain crazy.
The math is even starker when you look at places like Wyoming and Vermont, each of which has fewer people in the entire state (575,000 and 625,000, respectively) than does the Twelfth Congressional District of Michigan, which I last represented and whose more than 700,000 residents are now in the hands of my wife, Debbie. She fights her heart out for them every single day. Yet her efforts are often stymied simply because it is understood that even should a good bill make it through the hyper-partisan House, it will die a quiet death in the Senate because of the disproportionate influence of small states."

","New Democratic majorities in the Virginia House of Delegates and Senate voted this week to roll back abortion restrictions the GOP put in place in 2012 mandating an ultra-sound and 24-hour waiting period.
“These restrictions were not designed to protect women, but rather to suppress their ability to make their own choices regarding their bodies,” said House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, who carried the legislation in the House. “This bill concerns an incredibly important decision that should be left up to a woman and her healthcare provider.”
Among the code sections to be struck is a requirement that women be offered a copy of the ultrasound image and an opportunity to listen to the fetal heartbeat. The legislation would also eliminate heavily-litigated building code restrictions (referred to by opponents as TRAP laws, for “targeted restrictions on abortion providers”) that threatened to shut down many clinics by mandating hospital-style standards including wider hallways and doorways but were never fully implemented by the state Board of Health.
The bills cleared the Senate on Wednesday and the House on Tuesday. They were unanimously opposed by Republicans, who passed the requirements when they last controlled both chambers of the General Assembly and the Executive Mansion — a status currently enjoyed by Democrats following sweeping electoral victories in November.
Two Democrats split with their caucuses to oppose the legislation, Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, in the House and Sen. Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond, in the Senate, where Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) broke the 20-20 tie vote.
Gov. Ralph Northam (D) has endorsed the legislation.
In addition to eliminating recent restrictions, the bills would expand who can perform the procedures during the first trimester from just doctors to nurse practitioners. The House version would also allow physicians assistants, language that Democrats in the Senate agreed to strike after two Republican health care professionals in the chamber, Sens. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, and Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, argued they weren’t qualified to handle the complications that can arise from the procedure.
The legislation does not address late term abortions — a subject of intense debate last year after a Democratic lawmaker acknowledged under questioning by a GOP leader that her bill would allow abortion “up until the moment of birth.” (Late term abortions are already legal, but last year’s bill would have changed the number of doctors required to sign off on the procedure from three to one, among other changes.)
Republicans prompted their own uproar in 2012 when they adopted the restrictions debated this week, which as initially drafted would have required a transvaginal ultrasound — something Democrats in the Senate noted during an impassioned, hour-long floor debate.
“Yes, we were on Saturday Night Live and the Late Show,” said Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, who argued the laws were not intended to protect women but instead to “intimidate, shame and harass.”
Republicans argued the existing rules are prudent, measured steps aimed at ensuring safety while guaranteeing women time to weigh a procedure that can’t be reversed.
“I can tell you personally there is a cost to a rash decision,” said Dunnavant, a practicing OBGYN. “I’ve said many times this is not like a regular procedure and there are different emotional components to it.”
Sen. Jenn McClellan, D-Richmond, who proposed the legislation in the chamber, countered that two major medical groups had endorsed eliminating the requirements: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Medical Society of Virginia.
“The consensus in the medical community is that they’re not medically necessary,” she said. “The consensus in our medical community is that they put barriers in the way.”"

","One evening the week before Christmas, about 100 people squeezed into a room in the Brooklyn Free School, located on one of central Brooklyn’s posher streets. The private school’s chair collection exhausted itself within minutes as attendees packed the room for the monthly meeting of the Brooklyn chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) — which, just a month earlier, had fit easily into the same space.
For now, DSA is proving an on-ramp for those frustrated with Trump and the Democratic establishment alike.
Since Nov. 8, 2016, thousands have joined DSA. The organization has ballooned to over 14,000 members, more than doubling in size from 6,500 members in May 2016. DSA National Director Maria Svart says of new sign-ups, ​“You could literally see the moment when Trump was declared the winner.”
Organizations such as the ACLU and Planned Parenthood are reporting a similar spike in new members and donations in the wake of Trump’s election. But interest in socialist groups, grown accustomed to being small and isolated in U.S. politics, appears to be surging in a way it hasn’t in decades. Many of those joining are young people who don’t have their parents’ Cold War hangups about socialism. Politicians like Bernie Sanders — an avowed socialist whom many supporters are looking to for an effective counter to Trump — have further sparked their interest in a politics outside mainstream Democrats and Republicans.
That puts DSA in a promising, if uncertain, position in the wake of Trump’s election. ​“People … are looking to DSA as an organization that full throatedly supported Bernie Sanders in the primary and has the potential to be a serious part of the fightback, both to Trump and to the neoliberal wing of the Democratic Party,” says Svart.
Founded in 1982 out of the remnants of the ​’60s New Left, DSA also has roots in Eugene Debs’ Socialist Party of America, which at its height in 1912 boasted 113,000 dues-paying members. Eager to avoid the pitfalls of insular ideological squabbles, DSA strives to work with community organizations and social movements. Following the election, DSA chapters have mobilized to support organizing by communities threatened by Trump and his supporters, including local mosques and immigrant rights organizations. DSA is also working on building a multiracial membership — its current members are predominantly white — while supporting existing organizing by communities of color. Brooklyn DSA’s Racial Justice working group, for example, is partnering with the New York-based group Communities United for Police Reform to help pass the Right to Know Act, aimed at increasing transparency and accountability on the part of the NYPD.
Ultimately, says Svart, there’s agreement within the organization about ​“the need for a multi-racial, anti-capitalist movement that is in touch with the grassroots.”
For now, DSA is proving an on-ramp for those frustrated with Trump and the Democratic establishment alike. The Brooklyn meeting on Dec. 22, 2016, was the first for Hannah Silverman, a New York native who worked on local Democratic campaigns in high school but grew disillusioned with politics before heading off to Brown University, where she graduated in 2015.
“I was afraid [the meeting] would feel futile,” she said as chairs were being collected toward the end. Instead, she was pleasantly surprised by the tailored facilitation — after a discussion of the importance of organizing ​“openly as socialists” at the local level, the meeting broke out into smaller committees on everything from affordable housing fights to climate justice — and the high attendance. ​“Looking at Trump’s election, the only way to spin it positively is that it compelled a lot of people to become politically active,” she noted. ​“It created a sense of urgency that was missing.” She plans to attend next month’s meeting. In New York City alone, DSA now has 1,000 members.
But deep-blue Brooklyn isn’t the only place where democratic socialism is undergoing a resurgence. Local organizers are in the process of getting six new chapters off the ground in Florida and four in Ohio, both of which went for Trump in November. DSA’s tiny national staff, funded entirely by dues and small donations, has been overwhelmed by requests to create new chapters around the country and is looking for ways to expand accordingly.
Tom Tilden, 59, is among those DSA members setting up shop for socialism deep in Trump country. Tilden is a DSA veteran, having joined when he lived in Chicago in the late ​’80s. But when he moved to Nebraska in 1993, Tilden says, he didn’t consider starting a new chapter there, though he remained a member of the national organization. When people talk about ​“the Left” in conservative Nebraska, Tilden explains, they’re referring to ​“people in the middle of the Democratic Party leftward. ​‘The Left’ is progressive. People don’t usually think in terms of socialist.”
But that may be changing after Sanders’ primary run, which ​“changed the nature of the Democratic Party in the state” while stripping away some of the taboos that plague socialist politics, says Tilden. In Nebraska’s March 2016 caucus, Clinton won just 10 of the state’s pledged delegates to Sanders’ 15, and he successfully won over some of the state’s most rural counties. Since the caucuses, Tilden has been working to get a new chapter off the ground in Omaha, and another has sprung up in nearby Lincoln. About 30 people attended the first meeting in December 2016.
Like many other DSA members around the country, Tilden sees potential in building institutions outside the Democratic Party, but is also a firm believer in trying to stage a takeover from the inside. This fall, he joined Keystone XL pipeline opponent Jane Kleeb on the ticket to run Nebraska’s Democratic Party. She’s now the party’s state chair. Tilden is second associate chair, and has similar goals for his work in this position as he does as a local DSA organizer: Reaching working-class voters, especially those who went for Trump but might yet be won over to the kind of anti-racist, anti-capitalist movement that DSA hopes to build.
“People in rural Nebraska are more progressive than they realize,” Tilden reasons. While door-knocking during the Sanders campaign, he and other volunteers found that many rural voters took firm stands against corporate agriculture and attacks on public education. ​“I think once we work with them on their issue, they’ll see that the people on their side are not the Republicans.”
Instead, Tilden hopes, they just might embrace an entirely different shade of red."
demsocialist,"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/employment-rose-among-those-in-california-universal-income-experiment-study-finds-01614809936
","SACRAMENTO, Calif. — After getting $500 per month for two years without rules on how to spend it, 125 people in California paid off debt, got full-time jobs and reported lower rates of anxiety and depression, according to a study released Wednesday.
The program in the Northern California city of Stockton was the highest-profile experiment in the U.S. of a universal basic income, where everyone gets a guaranteed amount per month for free. Announced by former Mayor Michael Tubbs with great fanfare in 2017, the idea quickly gained momentum once it became a major part of Andrew Yang’s 2020 campaign for president.
Supporters say a guaranteed income can alleviate the stress and anxiety of people living in poverty while giving them the financial security needed to find good jobs and avoid debt. But critics argue free money would eliminate the incentive to work, creating a society dependent on the state.
Tubbs, who at 26 was elected Stockton’s first Black mayor in 2016 after endorsements from Oprah Winfrey and Barack Obama, wanted to put those claims to the test. Stockton was an ideal place, given its proximity to Silicon Valley and the eagerness of the state’s tech titans to fund the experiment as they grapple with how to prepare for job losses that could come with automation and artificial intelligence.
The Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration launched in February 2019, selecting a group of 125 people who lived in census tracts at or below the city’s median household income of $46,033. The program did not use tax dollars, but was financed by private donations, including a nonprofit led by Facebook FB, +2.58% co-founder Chris Hughes.
A pair of independent researchers at the University of Tennessee and the University of Pennsylvania reviewed data from the first year of the study, which did not overlap with the pandemic. A second study looking at year two is scheduled to be released next year.
When the program started in February 2019, 28% of the people slated to get the free money had full-time jobs. One year later, 40% of those people had full-time jobs. A control group of people who did not get the money saw a 5 percentage point increase in full-time employment over that same time period.
“These numbers were incredible. I hardly believed them myself,” said Stacia West, an assistant professor at the University of Tennessee who analyzed the data along with Amy Castro Baker, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
Tomas Vargas said the extra $500 a month was enough for him to take time off from his part-time job and find full-time work that paid better. He said he was depressed at the start of 2019, but now says he is happier and healthier.
“Every day I get to wake up and enjoy my kids,” he said. “My wife, we enjoy time together. We didn’t have that before.”
Tubbs cheered the results, telling reporters on a conference call to “tell your friends, tell your cousins, that guaranteed income did not make people stop working.”
Matt Zwolinski, director of the Center for Ethics, Economics and Public Policy at the University of San Diego, reviewed the study and said it is “really good news for supporters of a basic income guarantee.” But he said the study is limited because it only lasted two years, and people are unlikely to drop out of the labor force if they know the extra money is temporary.
“Tubbs’ claim that this experiment proves that a basic income doesn’t negatively affect employment is overstated,” he said.
Researchers found the people who got the money reported lower incidences of anxiety and depressive symptoms when compared to another group of people who did not get the money. Those findings could be key to next year’s study, which will look at how participants fared during the pandemic.
“It will allow us to ask the question: To what degree did that $500 serve as a financial vaccine as people were entering the pandemic,” Baker said. “The fact that folks went (into the pandemic) in a much stronger position, I think, bodes really well for the ways in which cash can really alleviate chronic strain.”
People got the money once a month on a debit card, which let researchers track how most of the people spent it. Less than 1% of the money went to tobacco and alcohol.
Tubbs, who lost his reelection bid as Stockton’s mayor in November, said his goal is to convince state and federal lawmakers to implement guaranteed income programs on a larger scale. Aside from conservatives who object to big government spending, opposition also comes from labor unions that worry the government would end other social safety net programs to pay for it. Yang’s plan would have cost nearly $3 trillion a year to provide a guaranteed income to everyone.
“That’s a question these experiments are not designed to answer,” said Steve Smith, communications director for the California Labor Federation.
Still, guaranteed income programs seem to be gaining momentum. More than 40 mayors have joined Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, with many planning projects of their own. A proposal in the California Legislature would offer $1,000 per month for three years to people who age out of the state’s foster care system. And in Congress, Republican U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah has proposed expanding the child tax credit to send most parents at least $250 per month.
Tubbs said that’s a big difference from when he first announced this guaranteed income program four years ago.
“How the pendulum has swung,” he said."

","Thousands of tenants in New York City are about to embark on the city’s largest rent strike in decades.
Renters account for approximately 68% of all households in New York City, compared to 36% nationally. The city has been overwhelmingly devastated by the coronavirus pandemic, and low-income renters argue they’ve felt the brunt of that impact without much assurance they’ll be cared for once the public health crisis abates.

So advocates are urging renters to simply stop paying on May 1.
The strikers are demanding that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo cancel rent and mortgage payments for four months or the duration of the coronavirus pandemic, whichever is longer. That would be a significant escalation from the state’s current solution: a moratorium on evictions, which is set to end June 20. And it’s a recognition that the economy could remain in crisis for years.
On Monday, the strikers got a high-profile supporter.
“People can’t pay,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive Democrat from the Bronx, who is co-sponsoring a national bill to cancel rent, said on a call with strikers Monday. “You cannot coerce someone into doing something that they cannot do. There is no money in the bank. People need to feed their kids.”
At least 57 apartment buildings including 1,814 tenants across New York City are participating, according to advocates with the group Housing Justice for All. Most of the strikers, advocates say, are people who wouldn’t have been able to make rent in May anyway.
Separately, nearly 9,000 people have signed an online pledge to either support the strikers, or agree to withhold rent. Other groups are organizing rent strikes in Philadelphia; Chicago; Alexandria, Virginia; Gainesville; and Los Angeles.
“With each passing day, it becomes more and more clear that there is no plan for the millions of people who rent, for the millions of people who are homeless,” said Cea Weaver, campaign coordinator with Housing Justice for All, a coalition of affordable housing advocates in New York State. “The reality that the federal government and our state government is not stepping in to take this issue seriously is really sinking in.”
Zoom organizing
Advocates organizing the strike have been circulating exhaustive guides for effective organizing, rallying tenants in Zoom meetings, and advising first-time strikers across various messaging apps like WhatsApp and WeChat.
In one new apartment building in Brooklyn’s Bushwick neighborhood, Lafleur Duncan, a 52-year-old nanny, is planning to withhold next month’s rent — not that she would’ve been able to pay in full anyway. She’s not working right now and hasn’t yet received unemployment benefits, meaning her $2,400 a month for a two-bedroom apartment is on the line.

Tenants in her building tried to negotiate with their landlord, Bushwick Realty Holdings, to cut rent by 50%. They also asked that the landlord provide total relief to the five tenants who didn't have any money at all. They said that went nowhere. So they'll be holding rent on May 1.
A representative for Bushwick Realty Holdings wasn’t immediately available for comment.
“Even if they will not evict us, we still have to come up with the money at the end of this to pay rent, and if we’re not working, where are we going to find all of that money?” Duncan said.
Other tenants worry that at the end of Gov. Cuomo’s rent moratorium, they’ll just be left with a mountain of back rent they won’t be able to pay.
“It’s really just pushing it farther down the line, and leaving the most vulnerable people to shoulder that,” said Gabo Camnitzer, an artist and professor who lives in the building but can currently afford his rent. He won’t pay it, though, out of solidarity with neighbors like Duncan.
New York City hasn’t seen a rent strike of this scale since the 1970s when residents of the Bronx’s Co-Op City struck over rising carrying charges. In the 1960s, hundreds of buildings went on strike in Harlem over destitute living conditions, sending rubber rats to the governor’s office in protest.
Today’s strikers hope that by banding together in their non-payment, tenants can cause a domino effect in which both renters and politically influential landlords pressure the state to do anything to remedy the strike.

“People don’t have the money to pay the rent, and what we’re asking them to do is politicize that experience,” said Tara Raghuveer, director of the “Homes Guarantee” campaign at People’s Action, a national network of grassroots advocacy groups advising renters around the country.
“A whole class of people have had their income zeroed out.”
“The circumstances of the moment are so absurd: By no fault of their own, a whole class of people have had their income zeroed out.”
Helping small landlords
As they see it, small landlords could benefit from the strike too, either by legislators enacting mortgage relief or upon the unlikely passing of Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar’s bill, which would establish a relief fund for landlords who agree to meet a certain set of requirements, including not raising rent.
That logic doesn’t sit right with Jay Martin, executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, which represents about 4,000 small landlords.
Martin said that Omar’s bill — which requires landlords to cap rent increases if they want help — isn’t doable when one considers the rising cost of upkeep. He also worries that the rent strike could be destructive for smaller, family landlords who would consequently miss their myriad payments, including their property taxes, payroll, water costs, and more.
Instead, he proposes that tenants receive some sort of direct relief from the federal government, which has been a solution enacted by governments in Europe. The rent strikers believe that sort of proposal puts the burden on renters, rather than their landlords, however.

“Certainly there’s an argument to be made for people going on rent strikes if they’re demanding better services,” Martin said. “But that doesn’t seem to be the motivation here. It seems to be to force political action. And the difference here is that when you’re calling for a rent strike in this context, you’re calling to prevent the payment of property taxes, which fund vital services.”
And then, there’s a possibility that some strikers will be evicted once New York’s moratorium is lifted in late June. Tenant organizing guides warn of that fact, too, although they offer that if the strikes grow large enough, organizers will be more likely to win their demands. To them, organizing is worth the risk, especially if it causes long-lasting political change and economic relief.
“I don’t think any attorney would advise any and all tenants to engage in a rent strike without considering their particular circumstances and risks that are associated,” said Jason Wu, a New York City attorney and trustee for the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys. “But I wholeheartedly support the rent strike movement because it’s fundamentally about building tenant power.”"
demsocialist,"https://ips-dc.org/ending-the-myth-that-trump-is-ending-the-wars/?
","Trump has sent more new troops to the Middle East than he’s bringing home from Afghanistan.
There was this moment during the State of the Union Address that I can’t stop thinking about.
When President Trump spoke to army wife Amy Wiliams during his speech and told her he’d arranged her husband’s return home from Afghanistan as a “special surprise,” it was difficult to watch.
Sgt. Townsend Williams then descended the stairs to reunite with his family after seven months of deployment. Congress cheered. A military family’s reunion — with its complicated feelings that are typically handled in private or on a base — was used for an applause line.
That gimmick was the only glimpse many Americans will get of the human reality of our wars overseas. There is no such window into the lives or suffering of people in Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan, or beyond.
That’s unacceptable. And so is the myth that Trump is actually ending the wars.
The U.S. has reached a deal with the Taliban to remove 3,400 of the 12,000 U.S. troops currently in Afghanistan, with the pledge to withdraw more if certain conditions are met. That’s a long overdue first step, as U.S. officials are finally recognizing the war is a disaster and are negotiating an exit.
But taking a step back reveals a bigger picture in which, from West Africa to Central Asia, Trump is expanding and deepening the War on Terror — and making it deadlier.
Far from ending the wars, U.S. airstrikes in Somalia and Syria have skyrocketed under Trump, leading to more civilian casualties in both countries. In Somalia, the forces U.S. operations are supposedly targeting have not been defeated after 18 years of war. It received little coverage in the U.S., but the first week of this year saw a truck bombing in Mogadishu that killed more than 80 people.
Everywhere, ordinary people, people just like us except they happen to live in other countries, pay the price of these wars. Last year saw over 10,000 Afghan civilian casualties — the sixth year in a row to reach those grim heights.
And don’t forget, 2020 opened with Trump bringing the U.S. to the brink of a potentially catastrophic war with Iran. And he continues to escalate punishing sanctions on the country, devastating women, children, the elderly, and other vulnerable people.
Trump is not ending wars, but preparing for more war. Over the past year, he has deployed 14,000 more troops in the Middle East — beyond the tens of thousands already there.
If this seems surprising, it’s in part because the problem has been bipartisan. Indeed, many congressional Democrats have actually supported these escalations.
In December, 188 House Democrats joined Republicans in passing a nearly $740 billion military budget that continues the wars. They passed the budget after abandoning anti-war measures put forward by California Representative Barbara Lee and the precious few others trying to rein in the wars.
It’s worth remembering that State of the Union visual, of Congress rising in unison and joining the president in applause for his stunt with the Williams family. Because there has been nearly that level of consensus year after year in funding, and expanding, the wars.
Ending them will not be easy. Too many powerful interests — from weapons manufacturers to politicians — are too invested. But ending the wars begins with rejecting the idea that real opposition will come from inside the White House.
As with so many other issues — like when Trump first enacted the Muslim Ban and people flocked to airports nationwide in protest, or the outpouring against caging children at the border — those of us who oppose the wars need to raise our voices, and make the leaders follow."

","SAN FRANCISCO — With the growing recognition that prosecutors hold the keys to a fairer criminal justice system, the term “progressive prosecutor” has almost become trendy. This is how Senator Kamala Harris of California, a likely presidential candidate and a former prosecutor, describes herself.
But she’s not.
Time after time, when progressives urged her to embrace criminal justice reforms as a district attorney and then the state’s attorney general, Ms. Harris opposed them or stayed silent. Most troubling, Ms. Harris fought tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through official misconduct that included evidence tampering, false testimony and the suppression of crucial information by prosecutors.
Consider her record as San Francisco’s district attorney from 2004 to 2011. Ms. Harris was criticized in 2010 for withholding information about a police laboratory technician who had been accused of “intentionally sabotaging” her work and stealing drugs from the lab. After a memo surfaced showing that Ms. Harris’s deputies knew about the technician’s wrongdoing and recent conviction, but failed to alert defense lawyers, a judge condemned Ms. Harris’s indifference to the systemic violation of the defendants’ constitutional rights.
Ms. Harris contested the ruling by arguing that the judge, whose husband was a defense attorney and had spoken publicly about the importance of disclosing evidence, had a conflict of interest. Ms. Harris lost. More than 600 cases handled by the corrupt technician were dismissed."

","But after Ms. Ibrahim returned from breast cancer treatment, a new manager scolded her for working slowly , she said. She felt the manager did not see her as a woman who had worked for aid groups, overcome breast cancer and raised a daughter who got into medical school just five years after arriving in the United States. Instead, she said, the new manager saw her as a worker who, on one particular day , was slow.
A white co-worker stood up for Ms. Ibrahim, she said, and the manager apologized.
“The new managers are like military — they don’t give you respect,” Ms. Ibrahim said. “At the beginning, I was paying attention to Awood, but finally the pressure they were talking about became the reality that I see every day.”
Awood said it had connected with hundreds of workers at the Shakopee warehouse and nearby facilities, with support from local mosques and community leaders. It shares space with the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations at a Lutheran church and has political allies. Ilhan Omar, elected this month as one of the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, has attended an Awood event, as has her fellow Democrat Tim Walz, the incoming governor .
Awood has four employees and is financed by grants and the Service Employees International Union, Mr. Muse said. A Somali immigrant himself, Mr. Muse worked for the union organizing home health aides and then as a senior policy aide for the former mayor of Minneapolis before joining Awood this year.
By the time he arrived, many recent immigrants were already connecting with one another as Amazon workers because of the company’s initial recruitment campaign and coordinated transportation. Workers talked about Awood during breaks and car pools.
They have a WhatsApp text message group and have held several smaller actions to build awareness of their organizing and concerns. After workers at one of the facilities near Minneapolis planned to wear light blue, the color of the Somali flag, on the same day, Amazon said it would build a dedicated prayer space there. When Amazon’s annual Prime Day shopping event coincided with Ramadan, they held a protest seeking lighter workloads during the fast.
“One thing to know about our community — we talk a lot on the phone and chat over coffee,” Mr. Muse said. “That makes organizing easier.”"

“What we’re getting right now isn’t fair and not right,” she told the Stranger, in reference to her wage of $9.19 an hour, then the city-wide minimum wage. “It’s easy to not think about the person serving you your food.” The very next day, a Burger King, two Subways, and a Chipotle all shut down after employees continued to walk out.
Durocher was part of a nationwide wave of labor activism among the traditionally scattered and disorganized fast-food workforce, made up of largely low-wage workers at the mercy of fast-food franchise owners who set their schedules and pay. The walkouts would eventually help lead to Seattle passing a historic policy that continues to serve as an example to politicians and researchers to this day.
Seattle’s minimum wage hike, which would jack up wages to $15 an hour by 2017 for companies with more than 500 employees, was passed five years ago by the City Council. By 2021, at which time the $15 wage would be phased in for all employers, it would be the highest minimum wage in the country, well north of Washington’s already relatively high wage of just over $9. “Worker voices and folks taking to the street shifted the conversation about it and made the policy feasible,” Rachel Lauter, the executive director of Working Washington, an activist group that helped organize the protests, said.
Today, Seattle’s wage is at $16 for large employers, and $15 for all other employers (unless they provide a certain level of medical benefits or employee tips, which allows them to knock it down to $12 an hour). It remains one of the highest in the country, and a useful case study as we head into a presidential election where a higher minimum wage has become the standard policy position for Democratic candidates.
At the time the Seattle bill was passed, the federal minimum wage had stagnated at $7.25 since 2009, where it still is today. While minimum wage increases are generally popular with voters, they also tend to kick up extreme opposition from business owners, who warn of massive job losses and killing off new businesses. It’s one reason why the minimum wage has stayed so low nationally.
Seattle was a natural place for this progressive policy to pass. It is both a very wealthy city with fairly liberal politics — ranging from socially liberal businesspeople to a democratic socialist on the city council — and a high level of union penetration and a history of disruptive labor activism that goes back to its 1919 general strike. But the bill faced a fair share of opposition. Employers, like restaurant owners, raised the alarm that the new wage would force them to close businesses, raise prices, fire workers, or move their businesses outside of the city limits.
When the policy went into effect in 2015, Seattle’s minimum wage became not only the highest in the nation, but likely the most studied. A group of researchers at the University of Washington, with support from philanthropic groups, have been examining the effects of the wage increase on workers’ hours and take-home pay as well as business closures and the price of some goods like groceries.
What the researchers have found over the last few years is quite a mixed story.
How it worked:
Policymakers are still looking at Seattle as a case study in how a high minimum wage could actually work in practice. The results are complex. But here’s what happened.
Generally, those business owners who threatened to leave Seattle to evade the new wage haven’t been following through. “The restaurant industry moans and groans about minimum wage increase, but the Seattle newspaper every month has a story about 40 new restaurants opening,” said Jennifer Romich, a University of Washington social policy researcher. (According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of jobs in restaurants and bars in the Seattle area has grown from 134,000 to 158,000 since 2015.) Surveying employers, Romich and other researchers found the most common response to the wage increase was to raise prices or fiddle with workers’ hours, and a “very small percentage were thinking about withdrawing or leaving the city.”
The story for employees is much more varied. The minimum wage for some large employers jumped from $11 to $13 from 2015 to 2016. The economists observed the impact of the hike in 2017 and found it had dramatic effects on the low-wage workforce and employment.
Not all of them were good. They found that the policy “reduced hours worked in low-wage jobs by 6-7 percent, while hourly wages in such jobs increased by 3 percent ... consequently, total payroll for such jobs decreased.” That means the total amount that employers paid to workers was less with the new minimum wage in place than projected payroll if the policy hadn’t gone into effect.
The data, researcher Mark C. Long explained, suggested a “tipping point” between $11 and $13 “when it becomes less tenable to keep work in the city.” (Critics were quick to point out that this likely wasn’t solely due to the minimum wage policy — Seattle’s labor market continued to heat up during that period, reducing the number of low-wage jobs compared to high-wage jobs overall.)
But a year later, the team published another paper that complicated their findings. They looked at the same time period and same wage increase, but this time broke down the actual take-home pay of workers. They found that workers who were already employed at the low end of the wage scale in Seattle “enjoyed significantly more rapid hourly wage growth,” following wage increases in 2015 and 2016.
Those who were already working more hours before the wage increase saw “essentially all of the earnings increases,” while the workers who had fewer hours saw their hours go down, but wages go up enough so that their overall earnings didn’t really change. They theorized that a slowdown in new hiring for low-wage jobs could explain their earlier findings that overall payroll had gone down.
Ultimately, workers already employed either saw their take-home pay go up or stay roughly the same while working fewer hours.
Critics of the UW researchers have seized on Seattle’s uniqueness to discount the UW findings. Ben Zipperer of the liberal Economic Policy Institute wrote that the UW research is based on a “flawed comparison” between Seattle and the rest of the state. He argued that the decline in low wage jobs was due to a hot economy boosting low-wage jobs into high-wage jobs, not the new minimum wage. The data did show, Zipperer argued, that all of the workers they studied were “better off after the minimum wage increase” — higher-hour workers earned more with a higher wage while the low-hour workers got the same pay for less work.
There are still questions about the policy’s impact that are harder to observe, such as new employees who may or may not have been hired had the minimum wage been lower. And of course, the question of whether this would work in any other city remains. “I take this research as a cautionary tale for other cities like Seattle,” Long said, noting that Seattle’s booming labor market, especially at the high end and in technology, “is a very particular thing.”
What all sides would agree on is that the people advocating for a higher minimum wage — those among the already employed like Caroline Durocher who went on strike six years ago — were right to do so.

","Almost a decade ago, Warren Buffett made a claim that would become famous. He said that he paid a lower tax rate than his secretary, thanks to the many loopholes and deductions that benefit the wealthy.
His claim sparked a debate about the fairness of the tax system. In the end, the expert consensus was that, whatever Buffett’s specific situation, most wealthy Americans did not actually pay a lower tax rate than the middle class. “Is it the norm?” the fact-checking outfit Politifact asked. “No.”
Time for an update: It’s the norm now.
For the first time on record, the 400 wealthiest Americans last year paid a lower total tax rate — spanning federal, state and local taxes — than any other income group, according to newly released data.
That’s a sharp change from the 1950s and 1960s, when the wealthy paid vastly higher tax rates than the middle class or poor. Since then, taxes that hit the wealthiest the hardest — like the estate tax and corporate tax — have plummeted, while tax avoidance has become more common. President Trump’s 2017 tax cut, which was largely a handout to the rich, plays a role, too. It helped push the tax rate on the 400 wealthiest households below the rates for almost everyone else.
The overall tax rate on the richest 400 households last year was only 23 percent, meaning that their combined tax payments equaled less than one quarter of their total income. This overall rate was 70 percent in 1950 and 47 percent in 1980.
For middle-class and poor families, the picture is different. Federal income taxes have also declined modestly for these families, but they haven’t benefited much if at all from the decline in the corporate tax or estate tax. And they now pay more in payroll taxes (which finance Medicare and Social Security) than in the past. Over all, their taxes have remained fairly flat.
The combined result is that over the last 75 years the United States tax system has become radically less progressive.
[Sign up for David Leonhardt’s daily newsletter with commentary on the news and reading suggestions from around the web.]
The data here come from the most important book on government policy that I’ve read in a long time — called “The Triumph of Injustice,” to be released next week. The authors are Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, both professors at the University of California, Berkeley, who have done pathbreaking work on taxes. Saez has won the award that goes to the top academic economist under age 40, and Zucman was recently profiled on the cover of Bloomberg BusinessWeek magazine as “the wealth detective.”
They have constructed a historical database that tracks the tax payments of households at different points along the income spectrum going back to 1913, when the federal income tax began. The story they tell is maddening — and yet ultimately energizing.
“Many people have the view that nothing can be done,” Zucman told me. “Our case is, ‘No, that’s wrong. Look at history.’” As they write in the book: “Societies can choose whatever level of tax progressivity they want.” When the United States has raised tax rates on the wealthy and made rigorous efforts to collect those taxes, it has succeeded in doing so.
And it can succeed again.
Saez and Zucman portray the history of American taxes as a struggle between people who want to tax the rich and those who want to protect the fortunes of the rich. The story starts in the 17th century, when Northern colonies created more progressive tax systems than Europe had. Massachusetts even enacted a wealth tax, which covered financial holdings, land, ships, jewelry, livestock and more.
The Southern colonies, by contrast, were hostile to taxation. Plantation owners worried that taxes could undermine slavery by eroding the wealth of shareholders, as the historian Robin Einhorn has explained, and made sure to keep tax rates low and tax collection ineffective. (The Confederacy’s hostility to taxes ultimately hampered its ability to raise money and fight the Civil War.)
By the middle of the 20th century, the high-tax advocates had prevailed. The United States had arguably the world’s most progressive tax code, with a top income-tax rate of 91 percent and a corporate tax rate above 50 percent.
But the second half of the 20th century was mostly a victory for the low-tax side. Companies found ways to take more deductions and dodge taxes. Politicians cut every tax that fell heavily on the wealthy: high-end income taxes, investment taxes, the estate tax and the corporate tax. The justification for doing so was usually that the economy as a whole would benefit.
The justification turned out to be wrong. The wealthy, and only the wealthy, have done fantastically well over the last several decades. G.D.P. growth has been disappointing, and middle-class income growth even worse.
The American economy just doesn’t function very well when tax rates on the rich are low and inequality is sky high. It was true in the lead-up to the Great Depression, and it’s been true recently. Which means that raising high-end taxes isn’t about punishing the rich (who, by the way, will still be rich). It’s about creating an economy that works better for the vast majority of Americans.
In their book, Saez and Zucman sketch out a modern progressive tax code. The overall tax rate on the richest 1 percent would roughly double, to about 60 percent. The tax increases would bring in about $750 billion a year, or 4 percent of G.D.P., enough to pay for universal pre-K, an infrastructure program, medical research, clean energy and more. Those are the kinds of policies that do lift economic growth.
One crucial part of the agenda is a minimum global corporate tax of at least 25 percent. A company would have to pay the tax on its profits in the United States even if it set up headquarters in Ireland or Bermuda. Saez and Zucman also favor a wealth tax; Elizabeth Warren’s version is based on their work. And they call for the creation of a Public Protection Bureau, to help the I.R.S. crack down on tax dodging.
I already know what some critics will say about these arguments — that the rich will always figure out a way to avoid taxes. That’s simply not the case. True, they will always manage to avoid some taxes. But history shows that serious attempts to collect more taxes usually succeed.
Ask yourself this: If efforts to tax the super-rich were really doomed to fail, why would so many of the super-rich be fighting so hard to defeat those efforts?"

","Over the past year, the indictments, convictions, and guilty pleas have largely been connected, in one way or another, to Russia. But now, special counsel Robert Mueller’s office is preparing to reveal to the public a different side of his investigation. In court filings that are set to drop in early 2019, prosecutors will begin to unveil Middle Eastern countries’ attempts to influence American politics, three sources familiar with this side of the probe told The Daily Beast.
In other words, the “Russia investigation” is set to go global.
While one part of the Mueller team has indicted Russian spies and troll-masters, another cadre has been spending its time focusing on how Middle Eastern countries pushed cash to Washington politicos in an attempt to sway policy under President Trump’s administration. Various witnesses affiliated with the Trump campaign have been questioned about their conversations with deeply connected individuals from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Israel, according to people familiar with the probe. Topics in those meetings ranged from the use of social-media manipulation to help install Trump in the White House to the overthrow of the regime in Iran.
Now, according to those same sources, the Special Counsel’s Office is ready to outline what cooperating witnesses have told them about foreigners’ plans to help Trump win the presidency. Two sources with knowledge of the probe said Mueller’s team has for months discussed the possibility of issuing new charges on this side of the investigation.
“If this is going to be unveiled, this would be like the surfacing of the submarine but on the other plank which we haven’t seen,” said Harry Litman, a former U.S. attorney. “I guess what Mueller has to date has turned out to be pretty rich and detailed and more than we anticipated. This could turn out to be a rich part of the overall story.”
“ If this is going to be unveiled, this would be like the surfacing of the submarine but on the other plank which we haven’t seen ” — Harry Litman, former U.S. Attorney
The switch in focus comes as Mueller winds down cooperation with former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who participated in 19 interviews with the special counsel’s team. In often-heavily redacted court documents made public over the last two weeks, the Special Counsel’s Office hinted at ways in which Flynn helped with its investigation into links between Trumpworld figures and the Russian government.
But Flynn was also involved in conversations with representatives and influential individuals from other foreign governments, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Israel—encounters The Daily Beast has reported over the last several months. Flynn’s cooperation with Mueller could bring new details about the scope of the special counsel’s probe into how individuals from those countries offered not only to help Trump win the presidential election, but also how they sought to influence foreign policy in the early days of the administration.
Hussein Ibish, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute , said it is unclear if Mueller’s team will unveil nefarious foreign activity beyond what normally occurs in Washington.
“Many of these characters involved are somewhat unsavory,” he added. “But governments deal with all kinds of people all the time. It might be possible to question the wisdom of some of these connections, but not really possible to impugn the right of a government to deal with shadowy dealers in influence and access.”
Still, the Special Counsel’s Office has taken a keen interest this year in practices that were once considered business-as-usual in Washington. Republican operative Sam Patten pleaded guilty to the rarer-than-rare charge of “causing foreign money to be paid to the 2016-17 Presidential Inaugural Committee.” Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Flynn were both charged with not disclosing parts of their businesses under the Foreign Agents Registration Act—the first indictments of this nature in more than half a century.
It’s unclear exactly how, if at all, this side of Mueller’s probe overlaps with his mandate from the Department of Justice to investigate links and coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign.
Mueller also has the jurisdiction to “investigate and prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the special counsel’s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses,” according to the code.
“For something like this to happen, Mueller would have needed to get approval from [Deputy Attorney General Rod] Rosenstein for this,” Litman said. “It’s not really in the original grant of jurisdiction and it appears then that he made his case to Rosenstein some time ago and that Rosenstein agreed.”
Mueller’s office has been investigating several meetings attended by George Nader, a Lebanese-American businessman and emissary to the UAE. Nader helped arrange the now-infamous meeting between Trump associate and Blackwater founder Erik Prince and Kirill Dmitriev, the head of one of Russia’s sovereign wealth funds—and he also acted somewhat as a go-between with representatives from Gulf state governments, at least one well-connected Israeli, and the Trump team.
Although Nader has been cooperating with the Special Counsel’s Office since March, it is still unclear what evidence he has offered prosecutors during interviews.
In one August 2016 meeting, first reported by The New York Times and later confirmed by The Daily Beast, Nader told the room that the crown princes of both Saudi Arabia and the UAE were eager to help Trump win the election. Also ready to lend his services was Joel Zamel, a self-styled Mark Zuckerberg of the national-security world with deep ties to Israeli intelligence. Zamel had already been in close contact with the Trump team because one of his companies, Psy Group, had drawn up a plan to use social-media manipulation to help Trump clinch the Republican nomination. The company sent former senior campaign aide Rick Gates that proposal.
But the connections between Trumpworld and Psy Group in 2016 were more extensive than previously reported, as The Daily Beast noted in November. Former employees said there were at least two other individuals who reached out to the firm during the campaign, both representing themselves as members of Trump’s inner circle.
Over the past year, Mueller’s team has interviewed a host of employees from Psy Group because of its connection to the Trump camp. Several former employees said the firm never went forward with its plan to help Trump, but others disputed that claim.
Zamel, through his lawyer, has also said publicly that he cooperated with the Special Counsel’s Office. His lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this story. The Special Counsel’s Office declined to comment. Nader’s lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Zamel remained close to the Trump team throughout the election and into the transition. Part of the reason? He had an easy in. He had been introduced to Nader years earlier by John Hannah, a former aide to Dick Cheney who now works as a senior counselor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a right-leaning think tank. Hannah has also been in the sights of the Special Counsel’s Office.
Zamel popped back into the mix in the transition period after the election and further offered services, this time for crafting a plan for regime change in Iran. The Daily Beast was the first to report the meeting, which included Nader, Flynn, and a Saudi general, Ahmed al-Assiri. During this time, Nader was also promoting a plan to carry out economic sabotage against Tehran. The meeting appears to be part of Saudi and Emirati efforts to lobby the incoming Trump administration against Qatar and Iran, their top regional competitors. The New York Times reported this year that Nader worked with Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy to urge the White House to take an aggressive stance against the two countries.
Mueller has also probed Nader’s role in the January 2017 Seychelles meeting between Prince and Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund. In his House testimony, Prince said the meeting was a chance encounter and the two met to talk about trade and mineral wealth. But prosecutors this year received evidence that showed the meeting was premeditated. Communications reviewed by The Daily Beast reflect that narrative.
A memo shows the two spoke about a range of topics, including peace between Ukraine and Russia, military operations in Syria, investment in the Midwest, and nuclear weapons. Although RDIF is under U.S. sanctions, it was and is still legal for U.S. individuals to meet with Dmitriev, and, in some circumstances, do business with the fund.
Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee are hoping to take another shot at questioning Prince next year—part of the new Congress’ effort to investigate the Trump administration. Prince told The Daily Beast this summer that he was cooperating with the Special Counsel’s Office, but it is not clear to what extent. His previous lawyer, Victoria Toensing, is no longer representing him."

","Why Aren't Millennials Spending? They're Poorer Than Previous Generations, Fed Says
Enlarge this image toggle caption Lynne Sladky/AP Lynne Sladky/AP
Since millennials first started entering the workforce, their spending habits have been blamed for killing off industries ranging from casual restaurant dining to starter houses. However, a new study by the Federal Reserve suggests it might be less about how they are spending their money and more about not having any to spend.
A study published this month by Christopher Kurz, Geng Li and Daniel J. Vine found millennials are less financially well-off than members of earlier generations when they were the same ages, with ""lower earnings, fewer assets and less wealth.""
Their finances were compared with Generation X, baby boomers, the silent generation and the greatest generation.
The researchers examined spending, income, debt, net worth and demographic factors among the generations to determine ""it primarily is the differences in average age and then differences in average income that explain a large and important portion of the consumption wedge between millennials and other cohorts.""
Millennials, which the study defined as those born between 1981 and 1997, with ages ranging from 21 to 37, ""paid a price"" for coming of age during the Great Recession. They had to face historically weak labor demand and unusually tight credit conditions.
Dealing with those financial obstacles probably created ""attitudes toward saving and spending"" that might be ""more permanent for millennials than for members of generations that were more established in their careers and lives at that time,"" the study says.
Despite millennials' much maligned, unofficial hipster status, the study indicates they're pretty mainstream.
Their spending on motor vehicles — which is sensitive to economic expansion and contraction, and accounts for about 20 percent of retail sales — shows millennial households have similar tastes and preferences to older generations, as does their spending on food and housing.
Their consumption habits are similar to their parents' and grandparents' — millennials just have less money to spend.
The researchers also examined debt between each generation. While the comparisons were ""somewhat mixed,"" researchers said it ""seems fair"" to conclude that millennials have levels of debt about the same as Generation X and more debt than baby boomers.
The study also noted newer financial obstacles for millennials. Broad economic trends depict a rise in health care expenditures, as well as a rise in college tuition that has outpaced general inflation that previous generations avoided in their young adulthood.
And the generation's higher rates of racial diversity, higher educational attainment and lower rates of marriage? Those are all consistent ""with secular trends in the population and are therefore not the aberrations of a single generation,"" the study said.
Millennials are still fairly young, so ""it remains to be seen whether having reached adulthood during those unfavorable years will have permanent effects on their tastes and preferences,"" the study says."

","On March 9 and 10, the Congressional Progressive Caucus gathered for its strategy summit in Baltimore, Maryland. Members of the caucus and allies from left-leaning organizations and European left parties gathered to talk policy and power for the short, medium and long term. At the conference, I spoke with Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota about the new push for Medicare for All, how to talk about racism and economic justice, and why it might be time to think about a maximum wage.
Welcome to Interviews for Resistance. We’re now into the second year of the Trump administration, and the last year has been filled with ups and downs, important victories, successful holding campaigns, and painful defeats. We’ve learned a lot, but there is always more to learn, more to be done. In this now-weekly series, we talk with organizers, agitators, and educators, not only about how to resist, but how to build a better world.
Sarah Jaffe: I want to start with Medicare for all, what’s going on in the House?
Keith Ellison: I just switched in for John Conyers. What we’re going to do, we’re starting a Medicare for All task force, a single-payer task force, and Pramila Jayapal and I are going to help lead that effort. Debbie Dingell is there, Ro Khanna is there, Barbara Lee is there, we’ve got a team, and we’re going to really push. We believe that, in this moment, the most important thing to do is help build the public support and the public awareness and the public knowledge. That’s our goal.
We’ve got a plan to move out on all fronts and have our members do a tour, have meetings in their districts on single payer. We’re working with Bernie, but we believe that this is the issue and that the time for this issue has come. Now we’re all staunch advocates of the Affordable Care Act, but we’re looking further. We imagine an America where when you get sick you worry about getting well, not whether you might be in bankruptcy.
Sarah: So there’s energy within and without the Democratic Party pushing in this direction. You were just saying you’ve been in Congress for 10 years. Does it feel like there’s a momentum shift, and when did that start?
Keith: It started when people like Paul Wellstone were raising it, and people were like, ​“What’s that, what is single-payer? We don’t know what you’re talking about.” And all we’re doing is building, building, building up the momentum. No doubt Bernie’s run for president caught a wind and definitely escalated the awareness. But what is really driving this thing is the fact that you get sick, and can’t afford your medicine — I have a young lady who I work with every day, smart as a whip, super talented, but she has toxoplasmosis, so she needs Daraprim. So that little creep Martin Shkreli says, ​“Okay, $13 a dose is now roughly $750 a dose,” not to mention EpiPens and insulin! Something like insulin! It’s skyrocketing, all so they can commercialize it. And people are asking: Does it have to be this way? Is it this way in Canada? Is it this way in a whole bunch of other countries? Turns out – no. People want a better alternative.
This is wrapped up with this market power issue. Every time a Martin Shkreli screws somebody, we’re winning converts to single-payer healthcare, Medicare for All. So what we’ve got to do is get out there and say there’s an alternative. Particularly when the Republicans are so dominant that we’re not going to pass it, our mission needs to be to get out there, get out there strong, let people know there’s an alternative and they don’t have to suffer this way. They don’t have to mortgage the house so they can get an operation.
Sarah: We’re talking about market power. You made a joke about a maximum wage.
Keith: No no no! I didn’t make a joke about maximum wage. I made a statement about maximum wage. What I’m saying is, if you were to say, ​“Look, if you make more than 20 times more than the people who actually make the products and do the services of your company, then we’re going to tax you more. We’re going to tax you at all.”
Sarah: That would be a good start.
Keith: You’re going to be ineligible for certain programs. Or we could even do something like say, ​“Look, if you want to pay yourself more than 20 times your average worker, that’s fine, but if you give the workers an increase as you get them, then maybe we’ll think about that in terms of some sort of a policy benefit.” But this idea that you can leave people in poverty as you are stacking up dead presidents like nobody’s business has got to come to an end. I mean, the CEO of McDonald’s makes almost $4,000 an hour, and they’re fighting people getting $15 an hour.
Sarah: But they turned their logo upside down to be a W, so…
Keith: They care. Awww. But my point is these people are not only screwing over workers, they’re screwing over the environment. They’re clear-cutting forests so they can graze more cattle, and we all know that beef production is extremely abusive on the environment. They’re bad actors, you know?
I wasn’t joking about having a maximum wage. Why shouldn’t there be a maximum wage? I remember when Ford, GM and Chrysler came for $80 billion to rescue the American auto industry. Okay, well how much does the guy who runs Toyota make? Oh, he makes a few million a year. How much do you make? $28 million a year. Okay, stop right there, I’m going to tell you what your problem is right there. Your interests and the interests of the company are not aligned. To you, the company is just something like toilet tissue, you wipe some with it and throw it away when you don’t need it.
Where did you get that greedy? And how did you create a philosophy that protects your greed, so that if I say you shouldn’t be that greedy you get to call me a name? Because they do, they call us names because we say your incalculable greed is not acceptable. That’s fine. We get to be called communists when we say that about them. Why don’t we call them what they are, which is avaricious and greedy? And not tolerate it? You can open up your company, you can even make a profit, but why do you have to make more than 21 times your average worker? The CEO of McDonald’s. You’re telling me they can’t make it on … I don’t know, if the workers are making $15 an hour…
Sarah: If.
Keith: You notice I said ​“if.” Why can’t the CEO make $300 an hour? That’s still a lot. If you told them they only can make $1,000, they’d be like, ​“Oh no no.” It’s ridiculous. And this is the world we live in. And you know, one of the panelists was right. We don’t even really know who these people are. We don’t know who they are. We don’t encounter them.
Sarah: That’s why we know who Martin Shkreli is. He becomes the face of it.
Keith: But we don’t even encounter these people. Your average working-class person busting out on $7.25, they know lawyers, because their son had one. They might even know a doctor, they go see the guy. But they don’t know who owns McDonald’s because they guy who owns McDonald’s, he don’t fly commercial, so there’s no way that they were working in the airport and they saw the guy. Unless you work at Mar-A-Lago, you don’t see these people. And so, we’ve got to figure out a way to make them famous in a bad way.
Sarah: One of the most compelling moments that I’ve ever seen was being at the Walmart shareholders meeting and watching the workers confront the CEO. And then the chairman of the board ran.
Folks were talking earlier about people being afraid to talk about racism under Trump. I wonder if you have thoughts about how to do that without saying, like Hillary Clinton unfortunately did, ​“half of these people are deplorables.”
Keith: Most of us talk about racism from a very capitalistic standpoint. And what I mean by that is racism is what working-class white people do to working-class black people.
What if you looked at racism another way? Racism is what the big bosses use to manipulate everybody against each other. That’s another way of looking at it. Same kind of thing. But what does it profit a working-class white person in the antebellum South to be for slavery? That’s keeping you in poverty. But you say, you’re white. We’ll let you walk around in poverty, they’ve got to stay here. It’s the classic pitting of the have-nots against the have-very-littles. And this is the way they do it.
My view is that we’ve got to engage in real conversations with each other. We’ve got to ask who benefits from all this racism. Who loses? All of us! Because when Florida purged black voters in the year 2000, the whole country got George W. Bush, which led us into a war with absolutely no justification. The whole country got a prescription drug benefit that enriched Big Pharma, this happened to everyone of every color. Racism helps elites control everybody else. Therefore, our fight has to be solidarity.
But we’ve got to do a lot of public education to help everybody understand what’s happening here. Why is it that the states we associate with the most intense racism are the southern old Confederate states and are also the poorest states? But make no mistake, they’ve got rich people in Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana — very rich. But the reason they’re able to maintain that wealth is because everybody at the bottom is at each other’s throats.
Now I’m not saying that there’s not racism in the upper Midwest. There’s plenty of racism in Minnesota. I know that — I’m from there. And there is racism in Maine. I’m not trying to say these people are off the hook. But I’m saying that you show me a section of the country that has the most inequality, I’ll show you the most racism. And that’s just how it works. But I think we’ve got to look at it that way.
We all see the world from our own angle, right? We’ve got to do a lot of public education, we’ve got to help people understand that these puppets have strings, man, and that we’re being manipulated. But we’ve got to find the right language to do it. I think it’s well within our power, and the success of the progressive movement depends upon it. We’ve got to learn how to talk to working-class white people about racism and not get them so damn defensive that they don’t even want to have a conversation.
And here’s the other thing — and I’m sorry for going on. In the popular media, who is the racist? It’s always the poor, ignorant white person, it’s always that guy. In March 2018, the chief racist in America is Donald Trump, a billionaire who comes out of the chute talking about how Mexicans are rapists, Muslims are terrorists, black people are all bad, tweeting stuff about black people committing crimes. Why is that? My theory is that if you do not actively promote racism, it doesn’t work as well. You have to promote it, you have to make people suspect each other, because if you don’t it won’t take. It doesn’t self-perpetuate on its own: It is promoted.

","In an interview with HuffPost, Uygur said he is a strong supporter of unions, especially at large corporations that aren’t sharing profits with their workers. But he said he worries a unionized workforce would bring new legal and bureaucratic costs that TYT can’t sustain. The network has a growing subscription base and has raised venture capital money , but faces many of the same headwinds as other online media dealing with the collapse of ad revenue.
“We generally feel disappointed, but unshaken,” said one staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. “We feel it’s the right thing to do because of what TYT values.”
But the message from Uygur was clear ― and, to at least some staffers, discouraging.
His talk ― at times emotional, the staffers said, with Uygur throwing his papers to the ground at one point, and chastising an employee ― seemed to contradict the progressive, worker-first ethos that TYT broadcasts to its millions of lefty followers. Jack Gerard, who is acting as the company’s chief operating officer as Uygur runs for Congress in California, told the staff they were not discouraging unionization.
Earlier that day, a Twitter handle claiming to represent TYT employees had announced on the social media platform their intention to form a union . In the staff meeting, the network’s co-founder and influential host, Cenk Uygur, urged employees not to do so, arguing that a union does not belong at a small, independent outlet like TYT, according to two workers who were present. He said if there had been a union at the network it would not have grown the way it has.
Top leadership at the progressive news network The Young Turks held an all-staff meeting at its office in Culver City, California, on Feb. 12. The regularly scheduled gathering was supposed to deal with personnel matters, but instead the focus turned to the staff’s nascent union campaign, which had just gone public.
“The reality is we’re in a precarious position,” Uygur said. “We’re in a digital media landscape where almost no one makes money or is sustainable.”
He added, “For a smaller digital media company, those are absolutely real considerations. It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have a union. Everyone should know the full context ... If folks say they don’t believe we’re in a precarious position, OK. And that’s their decision to make.”
Uygur said he was caught off guard by the union effort that appeared on Twitter the day of the meeting, and that it was so early in the process he wasn’t sure if it was real or if he was “being punked.” He acknowledged that he threw papers in the meeting ― in a downward direction, not toward anyone, he noted ― and that he reprimanded an employee whom he believed to be smiling. According to staffers, Ugyer said it would be funny “later” — an ominous statement they found unsettling. He told HuffPost it wasn’t meant to be a threat.
“The person smiling seemed to be openly mocking the idea that the company might not survive after 18 years. And we put all this blood, sweat and tears into it,” he said. “I don’t find the idea of us going down funny.”
Media has become fertile ground for union organizing in recent years, with workers at both old, legacy newspapers and newer, web-only outlets seeking the protections of a collective bargaining agreement. The union push has made for some awkwardness at organizations with liberal reputations, where management may resist collective bargaining despite overseeing labor-friendly coverage.
The campaign at TYT comes with another wrinkle: Uygur’s attempt to fill the Congressional seat vacated by former Rep. Katie Hill, a Democrat who resigned in October amid an ethics probe into her relationship with a staffer. Uygur is running to the left in the Democratic primary. The front-runner, Christy Smith, a California assemblywoman, generally has the backing of the party establishment and many labor unions.
As the union spat became more public, Uygur suggested on Twitter that the union campaign was politically motivated by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, the union trying to organize TYT employees. IATSE endorsed Smith in the race. But staffers said their first organizing discussions date back more than two years, and their recent attempt to round up support began shortly before Uygur declared his candidacy ― a timeline confirmed by a union organizer.
IATSE has asked TYT management to voluntarily recognize the union through “card check,” saying a clear majority of staffers who would be represented have signed union cards. That has often been the course at liberal media organizations, so staff can avoid the pressures of a union election. IATSE would represent the production and post-production staff ― about a quarter of the company’s 65-employee workforce.
But TYT management has proposed having the workers vote in a secret-ballot election to be administered by a third party, outside the National Labor Relations Board. Management has also disputed the union’s proposed bargaining unit, saying some of the employees should be considered managers.
Uygur told HuffPost he wants a secret-ballot election because a few employees told him after the meeting that they do not support a union ― “some, not all,” he said.
“Am I supposed to say, ‘I don’t care what you want?’” he said. “That’s crazy.”
In recent cases where liberal outlets have resisted a union drive, such as at Slate, employees have typically ended up unionizing anyway, either through an election or a public pressure campaign that wears down the employer. Uygur acknowledged his position on the union poses a political problem in his Congressional bid ― indeed, Smith has already dinged him for it ― but said he wants staff to know the potential downsides of unionizing.
“Look, at the end of the day, my opinion on it is irrelevant,” he said. “It’s the employees who get to decide and who should decide.”
The TYT staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity described support for the union as “a solid majority,” and said it hasn’t frayed despite the turmoil of the past week and a half. The staffer also said colleagues are insistent on the company recognizing the union without a secret-ballot election, and including all the staff they believe should be part of it. They expected plenty of disagreements in bargaining a contract, but not a fight over the formation of the union.
“We love the company,” the staffer said. “We’re just getting the company to live by its principles.”"
demsocialist,"https://www.truthdig.com/articles/noam-chomsky-four-more-years-of-trump-may-spell-the-end-of-life-on-earth/
","Noam Chomsky is not here to reassure you. As Arctic ice melts , centrists in the Democratic Party actively hinder progress on “Medicare for All” and Republicans work equally hard on voter suppression, the activist, linguist and professor is sounding the alarm.
In an interview after last week’s Democratic debate, Chomsky spoke with Truthout’s C.J. Polychroniou about America’s political culture, the rise of democratic socialism, the Democratic Party’s fear of progressives, and why he finds it “psychologically impossible to discuss the 2020 election without emphasizing, as strongly as possible, what is at stake: survival, nothing less.”
According to Chomsky, another four years of Donald Trump “may spell the end of much of life on earth, including organized human society in any recognizable form.”
This is especially true when it comes to climate change, an existential threat that Trump continually plays down. Chomsky quotes Raymond Pierrehumbert, a lead author of the 2018 United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. In a September op-ed for the Tucson Sentinel, Pierrehumbert wrote, “With regard to the climate crisis, yes, it’s time to panic.”
While other countries attempt to alleviate the effects of climate change, “Trump and the political organization he now virtually owns are taking steps, too—to exacerbate the crisis,” all the while threatening to use nuclear weapons, which could also destroy us if environmental decline doesn’t first, Chomsky says.
Our current political climate didn’t arrive in 2016, however—a point Chomsky emphasizes:
In recent years, the Republican Party has dedicated itself [with] such fervor to its constituency of wealth and private power that a voting base had to be mobilized on grounds unrelated to its primary policy objectives—with many dark forces. And it’s also worth recalling that there are parallels elsewhere, notably in Europe, with the collapse of centrist parties.
American institutions have consistently enabled these trends. When Polychroniou asks Chomsky what happens if Trump wins the Electoral College in 2020, if not the popular vote, Chomsky replies that he’s more worried the Senate, which he calls “radically undemocratic.” Multiple factors, he says, “are converging to a situation where a small minority—white, rural, Christian, traditional, older, fearful of losing ‘their America,’ will be able to dominate the political system.”
Chomsky refers to two bright spots in these dark times: the rise of democratic socialism, and a young, activist left (inspired by Bernie Sanders) that “doesn’t just show up every four years to push a button and then leave matters to their betters, but continues its activism and [engagement] in public affairs that is none of their business, according to long-standing democratic theory.” He’s also somewhat hopeful about worker-owned cooperatives that challenge traditional business structures. Chomsky calls these developments “a bare sample of considerable ferment that could open the way to a much more free and just social order—if imminent looming catastrophe can be overcome.”

","In an effort to address and debunk the ""disinformation, fearmongering, and straight-up lies about single-payer"" spread by its deep-pocketed opponents, Public Citizen on Monday published a comprehensive analysis detailing how Medicare for All would significantly cut healthcare costs, increase systemic efficiency, and improve coverage—while expanding it to everyone.
""The growing movement for Medicare for All requires everyone in Congress to take a fresh look at single-payer healthcare, instead of dismissing it based on false claims from those who profit from our fragmented healthcare status quo.""
—Eagan Kemp, Public Citizen""The growing movement for Medicare for All requires everyone in Congress to take a fresh look at single-payer healthcare with open eyes, instead of dismissing it based on false claims from those who profit from our fragmented healthcare status quo,"" said Eagan Kemp, healthcare policy associate at Public Citizen and author of the new analysis.
Titled ""The Case for Medicare for All"" (pdf), Public Citizen's report presents a section-by-section breakdown of many of the key questions facing Medicare for All proponents, such as how much the policy would cost and how it would stack up to employer-provided private plans that currently insure millions of Americans.
By every measure, Public Citizen finds, Medicare for All would be a dramatic improvement over America's immensely wasteful and deadly for-profit system, which is projected to cost $50 trillion over the next decade.
""The U.S. ranked worst out of 16 industrialized countries for deaths that could be prevented with proper medical care,"" the report notes. ""Medicare for All would ensure that Americans can finally access the care they need and end their currently incalculable wait times because healthcare would no longer be tied to ability to pay rising premiums and out-of-pocket costs.""
""For people who care about evidence—not ideology—the facts are clear,"" added Public Citizen president Robert Weissman in a statement. ""Medicare for All is the most efficient and most just approach to provide healthcare for everyone in America.""
On the question of whether Medicare for All would enormously increase America's healthcare costs—as the policy's detractors often suggest—Public Citizen cites recent research by both opponents and supporters of Medicare for All showing that a single-payer system would actually reduce overall costs compared to the current system, which is far and away the most expensive in the industrialized world.
""In the United States, we already spend $3.5 trillion, or more than $10,000 per person, on healthcare annually—a staggering sum—a great deal of which is wasted or unnecessary,"" Public Citizen notes. ""A well-designed Medicare for All system would create enough savings that even a significant increase in the amount of care rendered would be more than offset.""
""The people power on this issue continues to intensify as Americans feel the pain of a healthcare system that is focused more on profit than it is on providing healthcare.""
—Public Citizen
""This would be achieved by reducing administrative waste, harnessing the federal government's negotiating power to bring down the price of care, setting global budgets for institutions that would reduce the incentive for providers to administer unnecessary expensive treatments, and increasing access to more affordable long-term care,"" the analysis continues.
Addressing the prominent question of why the millions of Americans currently covered by an employer-provided plan should support a transition to Medicare for All, Public Citizen argues in its analysis that a single-payer system would ""bring consistent coverage for workers"" who are currently ""at risk of catastrophic healthcare expenses if they lose their job.""
""A Medicare for All system would mean everyone in the U.S. would be able to access healthcare wherever they moved,"" the report notes. ""And because the coverage would be consistent across the country, enrollees could focus on finding a provider that meets their needs, instead of figuring out which providers are actually in their network. Workers could focus on finding the career they want in their community of choice, instead of feeling trapped in a job because they need to keep their current insurance.""
The group's analysis goes on to address how Medicare for All legislation can be passed in the face of intense opposition from powerful interests like the insurance and pharmaceutical industries, which are already gearing up to crush Medicare for All before it even gets off the ground.

""Healthcare special interests spend typically more than $500 million a year on lobbying—the largest share spent by any one industry and more than 15 percent of total lobbying spending across all industries and on all subjects,"" Public Citizen notes.
The only way to overcome such entrenched opposition, the group argues, is by continuing to organize and mobilize at the grassroots.
""The people power on this issue continues to intensify as Americans feel the pain of a healthcare system that is focused more on profit than it is on providing healthcare,"" Public Citizen concludes. ""The American people won't stop pushing for significant change. The question is not if we will win, it is when.""
NEW STUDY#MedicareForAll would: -Increase access to care without adding to the deficit -Reduce administrative costs by $500 billion/year -Encourage economic growth -Improve financial stability for rural hospitals & doctors -Not increase wait timeshttps://t.co/StM5AbJQRq pic.twitter.com/eF7qxSQw6h — Public Citizen (@Public_Citizen) February 4, 2019
Public Citizen's report comes as Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, is reportedly set to introduce Medicare for All legislation in the House in the coming days. As Common Dreams reported, the House Democratic leadership has already greenlighted the first-ever hearings on Medicare for All legislation.
To build on the momentum for single-payer in Congress, National Nurses United is holding Medicare for All ""barnstorms"" nationwide this weekend to boost organizing efforts at the local level.
In a tweet on Monday, Public Citizen urged people to contact their representatives and pressure them to support Jayapal's bill.
""It's time to join the rest of the industrialized world in making healthcare a human right,"" the group declared."

","That afternoon, the A.D.L. issued a warning from its Twitter account.
“Depicting Jews as an octopus encircling the globe is a classic anti-Semitic trope,” the organization wrote. “Protest Facebook — or anyone — all you want, but pick a different image.” The criticism was soon echoed in conservative outlets including The Washington Free Beacon, which has sought to tie Freedom from Facebook to what the publication calls “extreme anti-Israel groups.”
An A.D.L. spokeswoman, Betsaida Alcantara, said the group routinely fielded reports of anti-Semitic slurs from journalists, synagogues and others. “Our experts evaluate each one based on our years of experience, and we respond appropriately,” Ms. Alcantara said. (The group has at times sharply criticized Facebook, including when Mr. Zuckerberg suggested that his company should not censor Holocaust deniers.)
Facebook also used Definers to take on bigger opponents, such as Mr. Soros, a longtime boogeyman to mainstream conservatives and the target of intense anti-Semitic smears on the far right. A research document circulated by Definers to reporters this summer, just a month after the House hearing, cast Mr. Soros as the unacknowledged force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement.
He was a natural target. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in January, he had attacked Facebook and Google, describing them as a monopolist “menace” with “neither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions.”
Definers pressed reporters to explore the financial connections between Mr. Soros’s family or philanthropies and groups that were members of Freedom from Facebook, such as Color of Change, an online racial justice organization, as well as a progressive group founded by Mr. Soros’s son. (An official at Mr. Soros’s Open Society Foundations said the philanthropy had supported both member groups, but not Freedom from Facebook, and had made no grants to support campaigns against Facebook.)
Definers also circulated research about other critics of Facebook, such as Diamond and Silk, the pro-Trump social media stars who had claimed they were treated unfairly by Facebook.
In at least one instance, the company also relied on Mr. Schumer, the New York senator and Senate Democratic leader. He has long worked to advance Silicon Valley’s interests on issues such as commercial drone regulations and patent reform. During the 2016 election cycle, he raised more money from Facebook employees than any other member of Congress, according to the Center for Responsive Politics."

","La’Shadion Shemwell, 30, is a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and member of the Huey Newton Gun Club. He organizes youth in the projects and has one Saturday a month where he does free educational activities at the community center and feeds all children who come. He recently won election to the McKinney, Texas City Council. His campaign was endorsed by the Collin County Green Party, followed by Our Revolution in the open primary. The Democratic Party, afraid of buying into the “angry Black man” criminal stereotype, didn’t endorse until he was in the runoff and likely to win.
Robert Caldwell, an activist who canvassed for Shemwell during the campaign, interviewed him for the Solidarity webzine.
Robert Caldwell: Mr. Shemwell, congratulations on your recent win to the City Council of McKinney, Texas. You are one of the youngest and as I understand it, only the second person of color ever to earn a seat on the McKinney City Council. What does that mean to you?
La’Shadion Shemwell: It means a lot to me. It means that the city of McKinney recognized the community engagement I’ve been involved with, that they respect and trust I will give my everything to bring about positive change in our community — but more importantly that it gives every little minority child the hope that one day they too could be in a position of leadership and be a voice. If I can do it, they can do it.
RC: Many readers probably remember McKinney for the infamous 2015 incident where a dozen police responded to a pool party where a group of Black teenagers were swimming and having fun, and police responded heavy-handedly with needless brutality, sparking mass protests. Were you living in McKinney at the time? And how did you react?
LS: I was living in McKinney during the pool party incident. I was one of the very first to meet with the Chief, before it took national coverage; I was also one of the organizers of the mass protest. This very incident is when I decided to run for council, to be able to address policies that allow these type of actions.
RC: This was a non-partisan race, and you ran as an independent, getting an endorsement of the Collin County Green Party in the primary and the Democratic Party in the runoff, with lots of progressives and leftists throughout the region excited about your campaign. Why is it important to be an independent to you? What is your philosophy of representing the people?
LS: I think it’s important to be an independent because then you can look at the full spectrum of possibilities without already having preconceived notions and expectations of party and people. I think it’s important to take the best practices from the left, [practices that people attribute to the] right and from anywhere else that has something to offer toward the goal of social uplift. Some people can’t see past their party lines.
RC: What are the issues you are most passionate about? How does that translate into your agenda as a city councilperson?
LS: I’m most passionate about representation for all classes of people with equality. I think seniors, elderly and disabled are overwhelmingly neglected and forgotten, I would like to be the voice for all those voiceless. I’m most interested in our most valuable asset, that being the people. We also need better infrastructure, transportation, and a full spectrum of housing opportunities.
RC: Open carry is legal for firearms in the North Texas area. But this doesn’t seem to apply equally to non-whites. Last summer, in a march against police killing of Christian Taylor, a Black teenager, you were arrested for having a rifle, but the jury found you not guilty. What are your thoughts about what happened?
LS: I believe after going through two trials that my constitutional and civil rights were trampled on. I believe that this is typical for minorities in this country. The sad reality is that laws are interpreted much differently when dealing with whites than with non-white people.
RC: Supporters of your opponent resorted to overt racism and outright lies, but they also brought up your arrest on gun charges, trying to spark fears of a “dangerous Black man with a gun.” How did you overcome negative publicity and mudslinging?
LS: I stood firm on my beliefs, I let my works in the community speak for themselves. I’m grateful that people were able to see past the rhetoric and took the time to get to know me. I think my ability to be open, honest, and to make myself available to all people was a big help.
RC: You were a clear leader in Black Lives Matter in the DFW area, and a member of Dallas Action as well as the Huey P. Newton Gun Club. How do you see the ideal relationship between elected officials like yourself and the ongoing grassroots movements in the communities and the streets?
LS: Community organizations have the opportunity to change their community, which could change their city, which could change the state, which could change the country, which can change the world. The community is where it starts and if we continue to start there then promotion up the ranks to influence change is inevitable.
RC: How can activists living outside McKinney in the wider region and elsewhere support your agenda? What advice do you have to other movement leaders who are considering a run for office?
LS: Everyone can support me by keeping in touch, sending encouragement and challenging me to do more and grow more. This is just the first step for me; stay tuned for more exciting news to come. Nothing beats a failure but a try. Running for elected offices is the only way to make the real change. It is the only way to replace the old with new forward-thinking representatives like ourselves. Run, Run, Run and don’t look back. Victory is in the laps of those running.

","Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) might not have won the presidency or even the Democratic nomination in 2016, but he did manage to energize a portion of voters and give voice to socialist ideals. That influence might be showing in a new poll released Wednesday.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-California) has recently been the subject of controversy as some Democratic lawmakers have once again started to suggest she should be removed from her position of leadership within the Democratic Party. Republicans have also sharpened their attacks against the leader, and a House GOP Super PAC said this week they would focus on Pelosi during the 2018 midterms, as Republicans have done in previous midterm elections to rally their base.
""During the 2018 cycle, [Congressional Leadership Fund] will spend millions of dollars highlighting Nancy Pelosi's toxic agenda and reminding voters across the country that Democratic candidates are nothing more than rubber stamps for her out-of-touch, liberal policies,"" wrote Congressional Leadership Fund Executive Director Corry Bliss in a memo, according to The Washington Post.
The poll published this week from Morning Consult/Politico asked respondents what they thought of Pelosi's job performance. Forty-one percent of Democrats thought she should stay as minority leader while 27 percent thought she should be replaced. Thirty-six percent of Democrats thought things had gone mostly well for the party under Pelosi while 19 percent said mostly bad and 27 percent said neither good nor bad.
But when asked if a hypothetical replacement should be a socialist or capitalist, more Democrats opted for socialism. Thirty-five percent said it's somewhat or very important the replacement be a socialist while 31 percent felt the same for a capitalist.
The Morning Consult/Politico survey interviewed 1,994 registered voters from June 22 through June 24. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.
Since Sanders launched his presidential campaign in 2015, the number of activists in the Democratic Socialists of America has doubled to 19,000, PBS reported in March. Socialism, once considered a word with highly negative connotations by many within the American political scene, has especially grown in popularity among young people.
A YouGov poll shortly after inauguration found 43 percent of respondents under 30 years old had a favorable view of socialism while just 32 percent of the same age bracket had a favorable view of capitalism.
Pelosi, meanwhile, made her views on socialism clear in February. A student at a town hall asked her about the Democratic Party perhaps moving more to the left on economic issues.
""I thank you for your question. But I have to say, we're capitalist―and that's just the way it is,"" Pelosi said."

","None of the NBA playoff games scheduled for Wednesday will be played, as players strike to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, WI on Sunday.
The Milwaukee Bucks got the ball rolling, refusing to come out of their locker room for their Game 5 against the Orlando Magic. Soon after their game was officially postponed, the Houston Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder decided not to play either, followed by the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers.
With his three children in the car, Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back by police in Kenosha, WI -- near Milwaukee. According to Blake’s father, his son is paralyzed and unlikely to ever walk again.
It remains to be seen whether the strike will be short term, or whether the NBA’s entire bubble might be in danger of ending soon. After the Boston Celtics and Toronto Raptors discussed sitting out, everything seemed to accelerate quickly.
“It’s an active discussion,” Jayson Tatum said after Wednesday’s practice. “Obviously it started with the Raptors and obviously that’s who we’re playing. It’s been talked about with other guys on other teams. People are upset or angry and we’re just trying to come together and figure out a way how we can do something. Obviously people are going to say, ‘Well, what is sitting out going to do?’ Obviously if we sit out a game or the rest of the playoffs, we understand how big of an impact that will have. Everybody’s going to have to talk about it, continue to raise awareness. We don’t want to just keep playing and forget about what’s going on in the outside world, because it’s affecting us. It’s affecting everybody. We’re more than just basketball players. We’re people. And we have these raw emotions and feelings.”
Tatum added that players are fine with individuals boycotting as well.
“If certain guys, certain individuals make their own decisions, that’s perfectly fine,” Tatum said. “Everybody is entitled to feel how they feel and act upon how they want to act. Nobody is going to be judge one way or another.”

","President Donald Trump devoted a large section of his State of the Union address last Tuesday night to the issue of health care. He repeated his claim that he would “protect patients with pre-existing conditions”—a claim that has no connection to any policy his administration has pursued. He promised to “never let socialism destroy American healthcare,” a reference to the Medicare for All idea endorsed by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. And he mentioned plans and touted accomplishments related to coverage costs, pricing transparency, and prescription drug prices.
It is clear the president believes that health care will be important in this year’s presidential race. Even last March, he was telegraphing that belief: “Let me tell you exactly what my message is,” he told reporters then. “The Republican party will soon be known as the party of health care. You watch.”
Then, in October, Republicans started dropping in some states an ad that tried—emphasis on tried—to be clever about the problems of health care. In the ad, a comedian tells the audience at a comedy club, “Somebody asked me about ‘Medicare for All’ the other day, and I said, ‘Don’t you mean ‘Mediocre for All’?” Everyone laughs with exuberance.
For all the optimism and triumphalism about health care in the State of the Union address, polls show that Trump is in a giant hole on this issue; it will be tough for him to dig out between now and Election Day.
One poll that clearly spells out the problem for the president and his party is the Great Lakes Poll conducted published to little attention on January 21. It is important because it surveyed people in only four states—Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Trump won the last three states by a total of 77,000 votes in 2016, and their combined 46 electoral votes put him over the top. If the rest of the states were to vote in 2020 the same way they did in 2016 but just those three states flipped, Trump would lose in the Electoral College with 260 votes to his Democratic opponent’s 278.
One question in the poll was especially relevant to health care, and unlike the questions in most previous national polls, phrased very directly: “Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling healthcare policy?”
The results show Trump and the Republicans have a big problem in these key states. When the survey was weighted to match the demographics of the polled states, 51 percent of Pennsylvania respondents said they “somewhat” or “strongly” disapprove of how Trump has handled health care, as did 53 percent of Michigan respondents and 56 percent of Wisconsin respondents. By contrast, only around 35 percent of the respondents in those states “somewhat” or “strongly” approve of Trump’s handling of health care.
As bad as those numbers might seem for Trump, his real vulnerabilities become clear when you look into the poll’s details. Women really dislike his handling of health care, with 53 percent disapproval in Pennsylvania, 59 percent in Michigan, and 58 percent in Wisconsin. Exit polls in 2016 showed Trump lost to Hillary Clinton among women in each of those states (by 42-55 in Pennsylvania, 42-53 in Michigan, and 43-53 in Wisconsin); he can’t afford to lose even more ground.
More striking is how this could play out among independents. In each of these three swing states, a plurality of independents says health care is the issue most important to them—more important even than the economy or national security or climate change. And the numbers don’t look good for Trump:
In Pennsylvania, independents made up 20 percent of the 2016 electorate and Trump won them 48-41. In the Great Lakes Poll, he is now losing independents to “the Democratic Party’s candidate” by 26-37 (with 36 percent still undecided). And they disapprove of his handling of health care by 52-32.
In Michigan, independents were 29 percent of the 2016 electorate and Trump won them 52-36. In the Great Lakes Poll, he’s losing them 23-40 (with 37 percent still undecided.) They disapprove of his handling of health care by 54-26.
In Wisconsin, independents were 30 percent of the 2016 electorate and Trump won them 50-40. In the Great Lakes Poll, he’s losing them 22-41 (with 37 percent still undecided). They disapprove of his handling of health care by 62-26.
Among all the respondents in the Great Lakes Poll—that is, not just the independents—Trump is currently losing Pennsylvania by 37-47, Michigan by 34-47, and Wisconsin by 34-48. In those states, as in most of the country, the Republican and Democratic voters are mostly locked in. But among independents, as shown above, the “undecided” numbers remain very large.
Much will depend on who the Democratic candidate turns out to be, but whoever it is, Trump will need to get the independents on his side by at least the same margins as he did in 2016. If health care is, as these independents say, their most important issue, and if they disapprove by large margins of Trump’s handling of health care, his challenge is formidable.

What makes this polling significant is how it sets up this race at its start, since it aims to understand the mindset of voters in states that are really in play and shows us how health care could become a decisive issue in the 2020 election.
“The aging population in these states is big in terms of numbers, and [health care] is a big issue for them,” Robert Alexander, a political science professor at Ohio Northern University and one of the academics overseeing the Great Lakes Poll, told me in an interview. “These people in these states aren’t looking 20 years down the road on how they get health care, it is much more immediate for them. This is a very real issue, and instability doesn’t sell well. Trump’s policy seems to be based on more chaos, and while that might be appealing to some voters on other issues, it doesn’t seem to be that way for the people we polled.”
Lauren Copeland, a professor of political science at Baldwin Wallace University and another of the academics associated with the poll, explains how attitudes toward Obamacare have shifted. “People are really skeptical of new policy changes that are imposed upon them,” she told me. “What seems to have happened is that the voters [still] saw Obamacare as a new policy in 2016, and were a little leery of it. But now it is the standard in many ways, and most people don’t want to lose it now.”
Copeland points out that many people were wary of social security programs in the 1930s, but that, over time, Social Security “has become the third rail in politics, and any politician knows opposing any part of it means losing their office. Health care is moving into that territory, and our polling shows that Trump is hitting that third rail. If Democrats don’t screw up their messaging on this issue in these states, they can win them.”
It is worth taking a moment to look more closely at how politics and health care policy intersect in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.
First, while these three states did not have big Democratic additions to the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections, they each elected or re-elected Democratic governors in 2018: Tom Wolf was re-elected in Pennsylvania; Gretchen Whitmer was elected to a first term in Michigan in 2018; and Tony Evers was elected to a first term in Wisconsin. All three of these governors succeeded Republicans.
Whitmer was chosen to deliver the Democratic response to the president’s State of the Union address last Tuesday night, and her speech emphasized the health care differences between parties. After describing her own family’s experiences with American health care—“For me, for so many Americans, health care is personal, not political”—Whitmer noted that “every Democrat running for president has a plan to expand health care for all Americans” while the president is “asking the courts to rip those lifesaving [healthcare] protections away.”
Health care was a big factor in each of the three states’ gubernatorial races in 2018. While Wisconsin has not expanded its Medicaid program, Pennsylvania and Michigan have, and about 1.5 million people from those two states have their health care now through the Medicaid expansion. (I have discussed the politics of Medicaid expansion in a previous Bulwark article.) Voters in the governors’ races sent a clear signal that health care should not be played around with but rather kept at least as is.
The Trump administration announced a plan last week that will transform the way Medicaid is funded in states that choose to participate. In the new arrangement, which is expected to result in some unspecified amount of savings for the federal government, federal funding for the Medicaid programs in participating states would be capped and would come in the form of block grants with instead of the traditional, open-ended grants. Those states would be permitted more flexibility in controlling how their Medicaid programs operate, including some alterations in eligibility. If Pennsylvania and Michigan were to pursue this option, it is likely that some of the 1.5 million Medicaid newcomers in those states would be cut from the program.
“A transition to block grants could transform Medicaid from a safety net program, designed to meet basic health needs for low-income Americans, to a program with funding limits that drive care rationing for the most vulnerable,” said Dr. Howard Burris, president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, in a statement last week.
If federal Medicaid spending is cut significantly, it is likely that the health care business itself will take a big hit. Uncompensated emergency-room health care has fallen considerably with the adoption of Obamacare and the Medicaid expansion, with Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin hospitals saving a combined $1 billion from uncovered people hitting their emergency rooms less from 2013 to 2015, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Health care and the public perception of health care have changed since the 2016 election. Medicaid is now by a majority of the public not as an entitlement issue but increasingly as a program that needs a large—or larger—public funding. And with this much money on the line, job growth in the health care industry is a political factor as well.
The apparent support of independents in these three swing states for Obamacare and Medicaid expansion might be further bolstered by other basic facts about the economics of health care. More than 650,000 citizens in these three states are getting federal subsidies for their Affordable Care Act policies; it may not be politically savvy to mess with their health care when you only won those three states by a total of 77,000 votes. Moreover, the largest percentage of workers in these three states are in health care and related businesses (13 percent of the workforce in Michigan, 14 percent in Pennsylvania, and 11 percent in Wisconsin) and the total number of “educational and health services” workers has now grown to more than 2.4 million in those three states. Between January 2017 and November 2019, 78,000 jobs were added in the three states in the “meds and eds” field, compared to just 19,800 manufacturing jobs there.
So, back to President Trump’s notion that “the Republican party will soon be known as the party of health care”: It seems hard to see how that could be true during the 2020 presidential campaign. The GOP pushed the “skinny repeal” of Obamacare in 2017 (with the late John McCain’s thumbs-down vote helping to kill it). The GOP has backed most of the agenda in the lawsuit by the 17 conservative states to overturn all of Obamacare. And the GOP is now pushing a policy that will leave more people without health care insurance than have it now.
Will the Democrats capitalize on this political opportunity and campaign on health care and the economy in these Midwest swing states? Can they leave the climate change and immigration rights and racial disparity issues on the sidelines? Can they ignore the urgings of political voices from California and Illinois and New York in the general election because how those states are voting is all but certain?
“If the Democrats are smart in their campaigning in these states, their message will be ‘If he gets reelected, Trump will be taking away your health care,’ and that will be an issue that pulls together their black and white voters,” said Rachel Bitecofer, assistant director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University.
“Those people who are affected by the health care changes proposed by the Trump administration will be extremely powerful in this election, but you have to realize which states count,” Bitecofer continues. “The Dems need to talk to people’s hearts in these Midwest swing states and not to their brains. They have to learn to talk to average people and make this a referendum on Trump and his handling of health care mostly. “
“But can Dems talk to average people? They need turnout in this election. Healthcare might do that.”"

","Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed a $2.5-trillion housing plan on Wednesday that aims to end homelessness in the U.S. and enact a national cap on rent hikes.
The release of Sanders’ 10-year “housing for all” plan came as President Trump is weighing federal action to address homelessness in West Coast cities. On a flight to California on Tuesday to raise money for his reelection campaign, Trump told reporters he could not let Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities “destroy themselves” by tolerating the explosion of tent encampments. He has used the issue of homelessness to disparage the deep-blue state recently, but his administration has said little publicly about its plans.
Rising rents in Seattle, Portland, Las Vegas, Honolulu and cities throughout California have fueled a surge in homelessness, and the dearth of shelters in mild-weather regions has made the squalor highly visible.
Sanders’ plan prioritizes establishing 25,000 housing units during his first year as president through the National Housing Trust Fund and, over the next five years, spending $32 billion in an effort to abolish homelessness. It also includes $50 billion in grants to cities and states for community land trusts that it says will “enable over 1 million households to purchase a shared equity home over the next 25 years.” The plan would invest $70 billion to modernize public housing, would cap annual rent increases at 3%, or 1.5 times the Consumer Price Index, and require developers to include affordable housing in new projects.

Housing, like healthcare, education and access to clean water, is a human right, Sanders says. His plan would add a “just-cause” requirement for evictions; it also calls for passage of the Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ people are protected by the Fair Housing Act.
He also proposed increasing funding for the Indian Housing Block Grant Program to $3 billion to build and improve affordable housing on tribal lands. A 2017 study by the Department of Housing and Urban Development found that in a two-year period alone, 68,000 new units were needed on those lands to replace deteriorating buildings.
Sanders has spoken recently at events centered on housing affordability in California and Nevada.
“Today in America, we have well over a half a million people who are either sleeping out on the streets or are in emergency shelters, including 58,000 right here in Los Angeles,” he said last month at a town hall at Temple Ahavat Shalom in Northridge, citing the latest findings of the homeless population in the county.

“And we have got to ask ourselves, what in God’s name is going on in this country when we would give over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1% and large profitable corporations, but presumably, we do not have enough money to make sure that a half a million of fellow Americans are not homeless? That is an outrage.”
He was referring to a report by the nonprofit National Alliance to End Homelessness that 552,830 people nationwide were homeless on a single night in 2018.
Several of Sanders’ rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination have also proposed plans, including Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California and former Housing Secretary Julián Castro.

Housing policy experts on Wednesday expressed skepticism about Sanders’ far-reaching plan.
“This is definitely farther left than any of the proposals we’ve seen from any other candidate,” said Jenny Schuetz, a fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank. She noted that with its emphasized role for the federal government, the plan appears legally, politically and financially unfeasible. “It’s not clear to me how he would implement this.”
But the National Low Income Housing Coalition noted that Sanders was addressing a growing worry over a national housing shortage.
“Our nation’s rental housing crisis continues to worsen,” the organization said. “Voters are demanding the presidential hopefuls offer solutions, and candidates are increasingly responding by proposing ambitious housing plans to address the affordable housing crisis on the scale needed.”

California has long struggled with housing affordability. The state has the highest homeless population in the nation, with 129,972 people who were homeless on a given night in 2018, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness. L.A. County’s crisis has been brewing since the 1980s, and a report released this year revealed a 12% year-over-year increase in the number of people who are homeless — nearly 59,000. The city of Los Angeles saw a dramatic spike of 16%, with more than 36,000 people sleeping on the streets, in shelters or in their cars. Last year, the city poured $619 million into housing and services.
Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties also saw double-digit increases. In the Bay Area, Alameda County saw a 43% increase in homelessness in a count conducted in 2017, according to the Mercury News.
At Sanders’ town hall in Northridge, Daniel Blitch, 27, told the senator about losing his apartment after his rent doubled last year. Blitch, a mental health professional, paused, his voice cracking, before saying that he was still living out of his car. He asked Sanders for a message for his mental health clients who are homeless.
Sanders responded that addressing the issue of affordable housing would help provide a starting point for homeless people suffering from mental illness. Sanders’ plan includes $500 million for outreach to homeless individuals and connecting them with social services.

“We will not turn our backs on people sleeping out on the street, people struggling with mental illness, people who cannot afford healthcare,” Sanders said at the town hall. “Unlike Trump and his friends, we do not see human life simply as trying to make billions of dollars and turning our backs on what goes on in the world.”
Another of Sanders’ Democratic rivals, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, campaigned Tuesday on skid row. He called the scale of the squalor “breathtaking.”
“The number of tents, the number of people on the street, the desperation — we saw fights break out as we were walking down the street,” O’Rourke said. “I can only imagine what your temper and frustration and anxiety are when you’ve been sleeping on the street night after night.”
O’Rourke, who has not released a detailed plan, promised to invest $400 billion over 10 years in housing for Americans with low or moderate incomes, building 200,000 units a year.

After his August town hall, Sanders also briefly toured skid row.
“It is painful to know that we are the wealthiest country on Earth, and there are people a few feet away from up here who are sleeping out on the street,” he said afterward, gesturing to 7th Street behind him. “For too long we have ignored this growing crisis, and everybody thinks it’s somebody else who’s out there until it happens to them.”

","A woman whose unborn baby was killed in a 2018 Pleasant Grove shooting has now been indicted in the death.
Marshae Jones, a 27-year-old Birmingham woman, was indicted by a Jefferson County grand jury on a manslaughter charge. She was taken into custody on Wednesday.
Though Jones didn’t fire the shots that killed her unborn baby girl, authorities say she initiated the dispute that led to the gunfire. Police initially charged 23-year-old Ebony Jemison with manslaughter, but the charge against Jemison was dismissed after the grand jury failed to indict her.
The shooting happened about noon on Dec. 4, 2018, outside Dollar General on Park Road. Officers were dispatched to the scene on a report of someone shot but arrived to find the shooting victim – later identified as Jones - had been picked up and driven to Fairfield. Police and paramedics then found the Jones at a Fairfield convenience store.
Jones was taken from Fairfield to UAB Hospital. She was five months pregnant and was shot in the stomach. The unborn baby did not survive the shooting.
“The investigation showed that the only true victim in this was the unborn baby,’’ Pleasant Grove police Lt. Danny Reid said at the time of the shooting. “It was the mother of the child who initiated and continued the fight which resulted in the death of her own unborn baby.”
Reid said the fight stemmed over the unborn baby’s father. The investigation showed, he said, that it was Jones who initiated and pressed the fight, which ultimately caused Jemison to defend herself and unfortunately caused the death of the baby.
""Let’s not lose sight that the unborn baby is the victim here,’’ Reid said. “She had no choice in being brought unnecessarily into a fight where she was relying on her mother for protection.""
The 5-month fetus was ""dependent on its mother to try to keep it from harm, and she shouldn’t seek out unnecessary physical altercations,” Reid added.
Jones will be transferred to the Jefferson County Jail where she will be held on $50,000 bond.
The indictment and prosecution is being handled by the Jefferson County Bessemer Cutoff District Attorney’s Office. Lynneice Washington, the district attorney in that office, could not be reached for comment. Jefferson County is divided into two divisions and the Bessemer Cutoff covers the western portion of the county, including Pleasant Grove.
News of Jones’ grand jury indictment outraged many, including women’s rights activists.
The Yellowhammer Fund, a member of the National Network of Abortion Funds which helps women access abortion services, released a statement Wednesday night. The group gained national attention after the passage of Alabama’s new abortion law.
“The state of Alabama has proven yet again that the moment a person becomes pregnant their sole responsibility is to produce a live, healthy baby and that it considers any action a pregnant person takes that might impede in that live birth to be a criminal act,’’ Executive Director Amanda Reyes said in the statement.“
“Today, Marshae Jones is being charged with manslaughter for being pregnant and getting shot while engaging in an altercation with a person who had a gun. Tomorrow, it will be another black woman, maybe for having a drink while pregnant. And after that, another, for not obtaining adequate prenatal care,” Reyes said.
“We commit ourselves to making sure that Marshae is released from jail on bond, assisting with her legal representation, and working to ensure that she gets justice for the multiple attacks that she has endured,’’ Reyes said.
This story was updated at 11:35 a.m. June 27 to clarify that the indictment was issued from a grand jury in the Bessemer division of Jefferson County.

","While Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign has been in the middle of the pack in raising money and in polling, she has set the pace on policy. | Rick Bowmer/AP Photo 2020 Elections Warren proposes $640 billion student debt cancellation
Sen. Elizabeth Warren rolled out yet another ambitious policy proposal Monday morning as she called for canceling approximately $640 billion in outstanding student loan debt.
The Massachusetts Democrat laid out the policy in a lengthy Medium post ahead of a series of youth-centered CNN town halls Monday evening with fellow 2020 presidential candidates at Saint Anselm College.
“It’s a problem for all of us,” she said of the massive amount of debt carried by students, which has reached more than $1.5 trillion and affects more than 40 million Americans. It’s reducing homeownership rates, she said. ""It’s leading fewer people to start businesses. It’s forcing students to drop out of school before getting a degree.”
The plan would eliminate as much as $50,000 in student loan debt for each person with less than $100,000 in household income. The $50,000 in relief would gradually diminish for people with household incomes between $100,000 and $250,000 ($1 less relief for every $3 earned). People with household income of more than $250,000 would not receive debt cancellation.

Warren couples the student debt forgiveness with a proposal to eliminate tuition and fees at all two-year and four-year public colleges. She presents the proposals as working in tandem: First, eliminate much of the student loan debt and then restructure the system to ensure that such debt doesn’t accumulate again.
“Once we’ve cleared out the debt that’s holding down an entire generation of Americans, we must ensure that we never have another student debt crisis again,” she wrote.
Warren’s Medium post — a spokesperson for her campaign said there wasn’t specific legislation at the moment — also proposed changes aimed at closing the wealth disparity among races. That includes a prohibition on public colleges using an applicant’s criminal history or citizenship status in its admissions decisions and a $50 billion fund for historicallyblack colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions.
Her proposed structural changes to tuition and fees are similar to free-college plans that presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) ran on in 2016. But Warren’s proposal on existing student loan debt goes beyond that of Sanders, whose 2017 College for All Act called for loan refinancing.
The call for canceling hundreds of billions of dollars in outstanding student debt is the latest example of Warren finding spots to run to the left of Sanders and ways to potentially entice progressive voters who voted for the self-described democratic socialist in 2016. The Vermont senator, who will also participate in Monday night’s forum in New Hampshire, continues to easily lead Warren in the polls and fundraising.
In recent months, Warren distinguished herself from Sanders with calls to abolish the Senate filibuster and the Electoral College, as well as first endorsing a long-standing House bill to study reparations for slavery.
In January, she also called for an “ultramillionaire tax” that would annually tax wealth above $50 million an extra 2 percent with an additional 1 percent tax on wealth over $1 billion. Sanders has also called for taxing the wealthy but he has not called for a similar “wealth tax.” Warren intends to pay for her high-cost education proposals — which she estimates will cost $1.25 trillion over the next decade — as well as a recent child care overhaul through this tax.
Though Warren’s campaign has been in the middle of the pack in raising money and polling, she has set the pace on policy. Her steady clip of far-reaching overhauls on everything from trust-busting big tech companies to establishing a government agency to produce generic pharmaceutical drugs has been a centerpiece of the senator’s candidacy.
It is part of a pitch to convince voters that she is the most serious and prepared candidate to take on President Donald Trump, despite lingering concerns about electability after the handling of her past claims of Native American ancestry.
Warren has been trying to turn her biography into an asset, regularly interweaving it with her policy proposals. “Higher education opened a million doors for me,” she wrote in her Medium post. “It’s how the daughter of a janitor in a small town in Oklahoma got to become a teacher, a law school professor, a U.S. Senator, and eventually, a candidate for President of the United States.”
CORRECTION: Elizabeth Warren’s cost estimate was misreported in an earlier version of this article. It is $1.25 trillion."

","After New York officials announced a plan to pay college tuition for middle-class students last year, Domonique Baker was pretty sure she would qualify for the money.
“When I first heard about the scholarship, I read everything,” the now 27-year-old hospital registration representative said. Through her research, Baker learned that she met what she thought were the major requirements: Her annual income was below the $110,000 maximum and she was pursuing a bachelor’s degree at one of New York’s public universities, SUNY-New Paltz. Baker filled out the application and waited to hear back, calling multiple times to check up on her status.
“ ‘There are too many barriers, misunderstandings, lack of trust and too many catches.’ ” — Sara Goldrick-Rab, professor of higher education policy and sociology at Temple University
Shortly before she was set to start her last year of classes, Baker said learned she didn’t qualify for the Excelsior Scholarship, as it’s known, because she was attending school part-time, balancing her schedule with a full-time job working overnights at a hospital. “It was marketed to middle-class families and working families and, unfortunately, everybody’s reality is different,” Baker said, adding that hers includes a full-time job.
Just over 20,000 students received the Excelsior Scholarship last year or about 3.2% of the state’s 633,543 undergraduates during the 2017-2018 academic year, according to an analysis of New York State higher education data released last week by the Center for an Urban Future, a New York City-based think tank focused on economic equity.
“That’s pretty modest for a college promise program that basically says every student can attend a public college or university for free,” said Tom Hilliard, senior fellow for economic opportunity at Center for an Urban Future and the author of the report.
Struggling to pay student debt? Here's what you need to know.
The governor’s office pushed back on the findings, noting that New York public college population used in the report takes into account students who wouldn’t have qualified for the scholarship, such as students only taking one credit and non-New York residents. That made the share of New York public college students served by the scholarship look smaller, the office said.
Perhaps more telling of Excelsior’s challenges than the relatively low number of students receiving the scholarship is the number of students who were rejected. Of the 63,599 students who applied, 43,513 were denied or about 68%, Hilliard’s report found.
“ When Governor Cuomo announced the Excelsior Scholarship 2017, he framed the offer of tuition-free, four-year college for middle-class students. ”
Those findings don’t jibe with numbers from the governor’s office, which found that roughly 95,000 students applied for the scholarship and between 22,000 and 23,000 ended receiving it.
When Governor Andrew Cuomo first announced the Excelsior Scholarship in January 2017, he framed the offer of tuition-free, four-year college for middle-class students as the latest in a long line of progressive policies on which New York state has taken the lead. Flanked by Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent senator from Vermont, who made free college a signature element of his campaign, Cuomo told the crowd gathered at LaGuardia Community College, “It should be a wake-up call to this nation.”
But Baker’s story and others illustrate the challenges localities face in implementing college affordability programs that are truly transformational both for individual students and families, and for the states and cities themselves who are hoping the initiatives will boost their college-educated workforce.
More states are offering ‘free college’ programs
Over the past several years, states and localities have been launching free college or promise programs, which aim to cover college costs in some form (sometimes only tuition, sometimes more) for students living in a certain place.
One of the main benefits of free college or promise programs, according to their supporters, is that they signal to students who might otherwise think they can’t afford college that there’s a financially viable path available to them. They also serve as an antidote to the opaque financial-aid system, which asks students to jump through hoops to prove their level of need before they receive any help.
But the large share of applicants rejected from Excelsior indicates that officials did not communicate the requirements properly said Sara Goldrick-Rab, a professor of higher education policy and sociology at Temple University and one of the architects behind the free college movement.
“ 53% of New York state public college students are attending school tuition free thanks to the state’s financial aid programs. ” — Don Kaplan, a spokesman for the Governor Andrew Cuomo
The fact that a small share of the state’s students are served by the program isn’t a problem in and of itself, according to Goldrick-Rab. What’s troubling is that the high level of rejected applicants indicates that officials “grossly overstated it.” “The main problems with financial aid were repeated here,” Goldrick-Rab said. “There are too many barriers, misunderstandings, lack of trust and too many catches.”
Don Kaplan, a spokesman for the governor, noted in a statement that 53% of New York state public college students are attending school tuition free thanks to the state’s financial aid programs. And indeed, part of the reason the share of New York college students served specifically by Excelsior is relatively modest is because the state already has a generous financial aid program, known as the Tuition Assistance Program or TAP, that covers many students’ tuition needs in combination with federal grants. Excelsior fills any tuition gaps after those grants are taken into account.
“We are proud that with Excelsior, thousands more are attending college for free this year,” the statement reads, later adding. “New York is expanding college access and making it affordable and the Center for an Urban Future shouldn’t stand in the way of that progress.”
What’s more it’s possible that the existence and publicity surrounding Excelsior may have also encouraged more students to apply to college and engage with the financial aid system for the first time. That gave them access to these resources — even if they didn’t actually qualify for Excelsior because their tuition is covered by the other scholarships. Applicants to CUNY and SUNY increased by 11% and 9% this year, according to the governor’s office.
The search for a truly transformational college affordability program
Hilliard said he agrees with the governor’s office that Excelsior shouldn’t necessarily be blamed for not covering the tuition of students who already have their tuition bills paid by other programs. But he said the relatively small share of students served by the initiative raises questions as to whether it’s a truly transformational college affordability program.
From the outset, the New York program has been plagued by criticism that it imposed too many requirements and that it failed to serve the state’s neediest students. To qualify, students need to be from families that earn $110,000 a year or less (ultimately that cap will rise to $125,000 by 2019). Many of New York’s poorest college students have their tuition covered by a combination of Pell grants — the money the federal government provides to low-income students to pay for college — and TAP.
“ From the outset, the New York program has been plagued by criticism that it imposed too many requirements and that it failed to serve the state’s neediest students. ”
Excelsior funding is only for tuition, so students with other sources of financial aid can’t use the scholarship for living expenses, books or other costs of college.
“I think you can ask how the state is going to achieve its larger goal of making college affordable,” Hilliard said. “It’s pretty clear that affordability continues to be a problem for students even when they receive need-based financial aid that covers their tuition.”
In addition to these provisions, graduates are required to live and work in New York for the number of years they used the scholarship after they leave school.
But perhaps the most controversial requirement: Students need to take 30 credits per year to qualify for the scholarship. That’s beyond even what the federal government considers full-time at 12 credits per semester. “That requirement is unrealistic for community-college students,” many of whom need to work to afford basic needs and to attend college, Hilliard said.
And indeed, about 83% of the students rejected from Excelsior were denied because they had insufficient credits, according to his analysis. Put another way: Almost twice as many students were denied for a lack of credits as actually received the scholarship. Implementing incremental fixes like allowing community college students to attend part-time and still qualify for the scholarship could help mitigate the problem, Hilliard said.
“By incentivizing on-time graduation, the Excelsior program aims to lower overall loan debt,” Kaplan said in the statement. Other New York financial aid programs offer funding to part-time students as well.
Baker, however, said the full-time requirement seems to be penalizing her for a situation in which she has little choice. When she was in school, Baker said she’d work at a hospital from 9 p.m. until 9:30 a.m. Then head to class, often not leaving until 5 p.m., delirious from lack of sleep. “I would love to not go to work full-time, but unfortunately I’m not in that category,” she said. “It seems like people who already have the upper hand had a better chance.”"

","This post is part of Polyarchy , an independent blog produced by the political reform program at New America , a Washington think tank devoted to developing new ideas and new voices.
House Democrats have decided on their priority legislation for the next Congress, and it’s all about improving the quality of American democracy. HR 1, the bill number typically reserved for the House majority party’s most important policy, marks the first time that political reform has been given this kind of top billing.
There’s a lot in the bill, including a number of ethics and disclosure and election security proposals that should be commonsense. But at heart, there are four big-ticket items that would be standalone news on their own: a small-donor matching system for campaign finance, mandatory independent redistricting commissions, automatic voter registration, and felon reenfranchisement. Collectively, this is the most transformative pro-democracy package in decades.
Political reform is popular, low-hanging fruit
Before we turn to the policies, a little bit on the politics of political reform. Assuming you haven’t been on a complete news fast, you’ll likely be aware that overwhelming majorities of Americans are pretty unhappy with the way the political system is working and think the whole system is rigged against them.
In the 2018 midterms, a large number of challenger Democrats learned that pledging not to take corporate PAC money was a powerful way to signal trust with voters. And on Election Day, wide majorities of voters in states across the country approved independent redistricting commissions and automatic voter registration.
In Colorado, voters approved two independent redistricting commissions overwhelmingly, one for congressional districts (71 percent to 29) and one for state legislative districts (also 71 percent to 29). In Michigan, voters approved an independent redistricting commission 61 percent to 39. In Missouri, voters approved an independent redistricting commission as part of a broader lobbying, campaign finance, and redistricting commission 62 percent to 38. And in Utah, voters also narrowly approved an independent redistricting commission,
Michigan passed a sweeping voting rights referendum with a 67-33 margin. Nevada also passed automatic voter registration, 60-40. With two more states passing automatic voter registration, that brings the number to 13 nationwide. Maryland, which already offered same-day registration during early voting, voted 67-33 to expand same-day registration to Election Day as well. With Maryland and Michigan joining the states implementing some form of same-day registration, the number is now up to 19 nationwide. And, as was widely reported, Florida overwhelming approved a constitutional amendment to restore voting rights to 1.4 million convicted felons.
The basic takeaway is simple: Reform is popular. Overwhelming majorities of voters think that money is corrupting politics, gerrymandering is a major problem, and it should be easy for every citizen to vote.
But neither party has ever really made democracy reform part of its national brand. Both have talked in vague generalities about cleaning up Washington and standing up to special interests, but only when they are out of power. Once they get into power, they do a few symbolic things, rediscover the benefits of the system, and move on. No wonder voters have grown cynical!
For Democrats, putting democracy reform first is a way to signal more clearly that they as a party take these concerns seriously.
The Washington politics of reform
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s predictable response to the Democrats’ package was, “That’s not going to go anywhere in the Senate.” Perhaps this is what Democrats want for now: By forcing Republicans to go on the record opposing some widely popular democracy reforms, Democrats can draw a sharper contrast.
Democrats can break up bigger reform package into individual bills to force House Republicans to take vote after vote on the individual pieces and put pressure on the Senate issue by issue, all against the broader backdrop of more aggressive House oversight of Trump administration corruption and impeachment talk.
Of course, there’s a danger here too. The more the basic functioning of our democracy itself becomes a partisan issue, the worse it is for our democracy. But we may already be there, in which case, the only thing Democrats can do is to at least clarify the stakes.
Certainly, a few of the more modest ethics and disclosure provisions in the package, as well as the election security provisions, could win enough bipartisan support to become law as standalone bills. This would be good.
But the bigger power of HR 1 is that it commits Democrats to being the democracy reform party, and gives them something credible and very popular to run on in 2020. Passing this legislation now puts democracy reform atop the Democrats’ agenda. This is a very promising development.
It’s good policy too
The most transformative piece of HR 1 is the new small-donor matching system. This would change how campaigns are financed, by creating a 6-to-1 public match for every dollar raised in small-dollar contributions. Rather than spending their time calling rich people and attending fundraisers on K Street, individual members would have a greater incentive to do fundraising events back in their districts. As a result, they’d get a very different sense of the most important problems facing the country.
Anything that takes members of Congress away from the gamut of lobbyist-sponsored fundraisers and cold-calling wealthy people and puts them in the living rooms of more representative groups of constituents would be a major game changer for the kinds of concerns that filter up to lawmakers as top priorities. This could significantly alter the premium parties now put on big-donor fundraising prowess in their candidate recruitment strategies. It could also pave the way for a new winning politics of economic fairness.
Most importantly, it would be a way for Democrats to walk to the walk of serious reform. It’s one thing for individual challengers say they won’t take corporate PAC contributions, when corporate PAC money accounts for only about 6 percent of all campaign contributions (and less for Democrats, and far less for challengers). It’s another thing to support reforming the entire campaign finance system to systematically reduce the potential influence of all corporate PAC contributions, and significantly increase the influence of small donors.
Small-donor matching systems, such as New York City’s, along with similar public financing programs in Maine, Arizona, and Connecticut, have been the success stories of the past decade of campaign finance. The majority of candidates participate, agreeing in exchange to limit their total spending, and these programs have survived both legal and political challenges. With HR 1, this approach has finally broken through to the national agenda.
Independent redistricting commissions would also be a significant change. Assuming the four states where voters supported independent redistricting commissions respect the wishes of their voters and follow through, that will up the number of states with truly independent redistricting commissions to 12. That means that in 38 states, politicians still have the final say.
The United States is unusual among advanced democracies in giving politicians the final say on electoral districting, a power that politicians have used since the beginning of American democracy to help their party. But in recent decades, politicians of both parties have become increasingly aggressive in pushing the limits of partisan mapmaking — especially since 2010. Widespread gerrymandering fuels the perception that politicians pick their voters, instead of voters picking their politicians.
Independent redistricting commissions would also almost certainly help Democrats in the immediate future. That’s because Republicans took gerrymandering to a new level after 2010. But an independent redistricting regime could help Republicans in the future, protecting them if Democrats win a wave election in 2020 and wanted to use their newfound control of state legislatures to punish Republicans.
Certainly, the easiest way to get rid of gerrymandering would be to make it impractical, by expanding districts from single-member to multi-member and adding ranked-choice voting to ensure proportional balance. Doing so would also make all districts competitive, something independent redistricting commissions cannot achieve. Given the fact that Democrats and Republicans live in very different places, it’s hard to draw two-party competitive districts in large swaths of the country. But that’s a big enough change that it shouldn’t be rushed. Independent redistricting commissions are more modest but a significant improvement over the status quo. It’s also a commonsense reform that everyone understands. Politicians really shouldn’t pick their voters.
Finally, the automatic voter registration and felon reenfranchisement provisions are also pro-democracy reforms that fulfill a universal promise: It should be as easy as possible to vote, and every citizen deserves a vote.
And as the recent ballot initiatives showed, both of these proposals enjoy supermajority support, likely because they hit the higher notes of commonsense decency: We shouldn’t be erecting barriers to voting.
Likely, both of these proposals would benefit Democrats, since low-income minority citizens and young people who tend to vote Democratic are most likely to be newly enfranchised by making it easier to vote as well as not be aware that in many states, registration deadlines close way in advance of election day.
But more forward-thinking members of the Republican Party should support these reforms as well. That’s because, by expanding the electorate, these reforms can give urgency to the actors in the Republican Party who are making the case that Republicans can’t be the party only of an older, rural white electorate, which is declining with each election as a share of the overall population. Reforms like these could force Republicans to change course sooner rather than later, and as long as we remain a two-party system, a more moderate Republican Party is essential to the future of American democracy.
The case for big change
The bill is still being written ahead of the new Congress, so details are still in flux. And it’s still possible some Democrats could get cold feet on this big package. After all, it’s a big reordering of the status quo. And new rules always threaten some members, especially those who have attained power and status in the old system.
Meanwhile, some of the newly elected members may now find themselves surrounded by Washington insiders and consultants, who are telling them they need to get cracking immediately on fundraising for their next reelection so they can pay expensive consultants to run their campaigns and get on the air. These consultants might be telling the new members that while their corporate PAC pledge might have made for a cute gimmick in 2018, nobody will remember it in 2020. What matters is raising money. This is the way things have been done for too long.
Certainly, the large professional class in Washington that has been built up around this system will aggressively try to defend it. But this is one reason so many people outside of Washington have grown so cynical about politics. Democrats have a real chance to break some of this and put in place a new set of incentives.
Change is always a gamble. But holding on to a clearly pathological status quo because the alternative is uncertain makes no sense.
Democrats also have a real opportunity here to move past the stale identity versus economics debate that has inspired endless columns about the future of the party and the trade-offs Democrats face in trying to choose between appealing to Obama-Trump voters and Romney-Clinton voters, or mobilizing young and minority voters.
The brilliant thing about the democracy reform program is that it appeals to all these groups, and avoids the false dichotomies. All these voting groups would like to see a democracy that feels less rigged against them. And all these groups should be excited to vote for a party that makes democracy reform their central message. And a political system with a broader electorate, fairer elections, and less dependence on corporate money is a political system more likely to deliver the kinds of policies all these voters say they prefer. It might even help to bring some much-needed faith back to our democracy."

Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) enter the 2020 election cycle as the leaders for the Democratic presidential nomination to take on President Donald Trump, according to a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll conducted in the immediate aftermath of last week’s midterms.
More than a quarter of Democratic voters, 26 percent, say Biden is their first choice to be the Democratic nominee. Another one-in-five, 19 percent, would pick Sanders, the runner-up for the nomination in 2016.
The two septuagenarians — Biden will be 77 on Election Day, 2020, and Sanders will be 79 — are the only two prospective candidates to garner double-digit support. The third-place candidate is Rep. Beto O’Rourke (R-Texas), who built national name-recognition through his losing Senate bid last week, with 8 percent.
“Beto O’Rourke is emerging to be an outside contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination, outpacing other potential nominees,” said Tyler Sinclair, Morning Consult’s vice president.
Following O’Rourke are three senators, all thought to be likely candidates: Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). Warren is at 5 percent, Harris at 4 percent and Booker at 3 percent.
Of the 14 other possible Democratic candidates tested, no one else earned more than 2 percent support.
The POLITICO/Morning Consult poll was conducted November 7-9, surveying 1,952 registered voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 2 percentage points.
Morning Consult is a nonpartisan media and technology company that provides data-driven research and insights on politics, policy and business strategy.

","Thanks to President Donald Trump, America's private prisons appear to be entering a gold age.
The stocks of the two biggest private prison operators -- CoreCivic (formerly know as Corrections Corp. of America) and Geo Group -- have doubled since election day. CoreCivic (CXW) is up 140% since Trump won in November; Geo Group (GEO) has risen 98%.
For all the talk about how good Trump has been for big banks like Goldman Sachs, he's been even better for private prison investors.
The reason private prisons are back in vogue is simple: Trump has made sweeping promises to crack down on crime and illegal immigration. Wall Street calculated quickly that Trump's rhetoric is likely to translate into more people behind bars. And that means more profits for private prisons.
Related: Wow. Stock market hits 10th straight record high
""We're getting really bad dudes out of this country, and at a rate that nobody's ever seen before,"" Trump said Thursday.
Wall Street expects prisons to get the biggest boost from Trump's plans to deport illegal immigrants.
The Department of Homeland Security is already trying to hire 10,000 new immigration officers and 5,000 more border control agents. On top of that, DHS intends to ask for more money to fund additional detention facilities.
Both CoreCivic and Geo Group have several thousand beds currently available that could be used for undocumented immigrants, says Michael Kodesch, a stock analyst at Canaccord Genuity. Private prisons currently house roughly 8% of America's 1.5 million federal and state prison population, according to Kodesch.
Trump's team embraces private prisons
On Thursday night, the Trump Administration sent an even clearer message that it plans to use more private prisons when Attorney General Jeff Sessions scrapped the Obama-era guidance to phase them out.
""This will restore (the Bureau of Prison's) flexibility to manage the federal prison inmate population based on capacity needs,"" Trump's Justice Department said.
Investors were thrilled, sending Geo and CoreCivic stocks even higher Friday. Shares of Geo now trade at an all-time high.
""Geo and CoreCivic are preparing to enter a sustained period of pro-private, tough on-crime policies alongside comprehensive immigration reform,"" says Kodesch. ""We don't believe the rally has run its full course yet.""
The Justice Department doesn't actually have many private prison contracts, but the announcement signals that private prisons are welcome in the Trump Administration. Both companies donated heavily to Republicans during the 2016 election, according to OpenSecrets.
Big U-turn from Obama administration
It was only a few months ago that private prisons looked like they were on their way out. In August, the Obama Administration slammed them for being more expensive and less safe than government-run facilities.
Private prisons ""simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs, and resources; they do not save substantially on costs; and as noted in a recent report by the Department's Office of Inspector General, they do not maintain the same level of safety and security,"" former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates wrote at the time.
After that, Hillary Clinton called for an end of private prisons in one of the presidential debates, sending Geo and CoreCivic stocks to their lowest level since the Great Recession.

The outlook changed dramatically after Trump's historic win.
""We see a gale force tailwind of demand coming from immigration policy and border security enforcement changes,"" says Tobey Sommer, a stock analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
The U.S. prison population has been declining in recent years, but analysts note that over 200,000 U.S. prison beds are in facilities that are more than 75 years old. States and the federal government may turn to private prisons instead of upgrading antiquated facilities."

","Holding red and white signs, they protested outside Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s election party on Tuesday, demanding the city take a tougher stand against deportation.
The next day, they rallied in support of the International Women’s Day strike, demanding social and economic equality for women.
These weren’t liberals. They were card-carrying members of the Democratic Socialists of America, one of the fastest growing groups on the American left.
The surge of activism sweeping the U.S. since Donald Trump’s election has energized the nation’s largest socialist organization, which has tripled in size over the last year to claim more than 19,000 dues-paying members. That’s a record for the DSA, which was founded in 1982.

“People really felt that they had to do something to combat the incoming Trump administration,” said David Duhalde, the deputy director of the Democratic Socialists of America’s national leadership, which helps coordinate chapters spread across 40 states. “We’re not only somebody you can resist Trump with, we’re somebody you can build a better world with.”
There’s no doubt that the grassroots group forms only a small part of America’s swelling ranks of activists. The American Civil Liberties Union amassed hundreds of thousands of new members after Trump’s victory. The fast-growing and liberal-centric “Indivisible” movement claims 4,500 associated groups compared with the 121 chapters of the Democratic Socialists of America. As far as political parties go, California alone boasts 8.7 million registered Democrats.
But unabashed socialism hasn’t had this big of a voice in American politics in decades, and many leftists say they feel energized. New members of the Democratic Socialists of America say they want build a grassroots movement engaged at the local level — and either pull the Democratic Party leftward or shove it out of the way.
That’s why, on election night, as Garcetti won one of the most commanding mayoral victories in Los Angeles history, dozens of socialists protested outside his election party. A few of the group’s provocateurs infiltrated the well-dressed crowd of Democrats inside, where they shouted against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement: “I.C.E. out of L.A.!”

“If you’re gonna do it, have some fun,” said Josh Androsky, a 30-year-old stand-up comedian who co-chairs the Los Angeles chapter’s “agit-prop” committee and who joined after Trump’s election. “A large portion of our members were radicalized by the election and the Democrats failing over and over again.”
The Democratic Socialists of America’s membership spike seems driven by three factors: younger Americans, who polls say are more open to socialism than previous generations; the 2016 Democratic primary campaign of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a self-described democratic socialist whose race ignited a grassroots following but also left bitter feelings about the Democratic Party; and the galvanizing effect that Trump’s election has had on left-leaning Americans, who have increasingly turned to grassroots activism.
Kevin Joerger, 24, of Los Angeles, is the classic example. He first got involved with politics when he volunteered for Sanders’ campaign, and when Trump won, “I had to do something more to stay sane,” Joerger said.
Advertisement
Although he “rooted, sort of” for Hillary Clinton to win the 2016 presidential election, the Democratic Party didn’t satisfy him. Joerger said he felt that big business had taken over politics and that capitalism had failed Americans individually, and he wanted “to be part of a movement in my community and see change locally, and not just nationwide.”
So he joined the Democratic Socialists of America, which places more power in the hands of its local chapters rather than its national leadership and stresses building coalitions with community groups.
Among leftists, the DSA is considered a “big-tent” organization. Decisions are made by topic-specific committees instead of through adherence to rigid ideology, which allows for a relatively wider range of opinion than other groups. The group also takes a more incremental approach to reining in free-market capitalism.
“As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people,” says the group’s website. “Our vision is of a society in which people have a real voice in the choices and relationships that affect the entirety of our lives.”

It’s yet to be seen what kind of impact the group might have. Socialism has never been a dominant force in American electoral politics. Previously, its most successful American leader was Eugene V. Debs, who won 6% of the presidential vote in 1912 running on the Socialist Party of America ticket.

And although some conservatives view the Democratic Socialists of America as subversive radicals, other leftists see them as not nearly radical enough.
“The farthest they can go is supporting elements such as Bernie Sanders,” Marc Wells, a Trotskyist, said disdainfully as he handed out leaflets for the World Socialist Web Site at the International Women’s Day strike in Los Angeles, where some Democratic Socialists of America members had also gathered. The site is published by the International Committee of the Fourth International, which, like other Marxist groups such as the Revolutionary Communist Party, USA, advocate harder-line approaches than the DSA.

In Wells’ view, Sanders and “pseudo-left reformism” only perpetuates capitalism rather than leading to a necessary revolution, and the result is that “the working class is led back into the Democratic Party.” By contrast, Wells said, “We seek to prepare the working class to seize political power.”
Duhalde, the DSA’s deputy national director, said the group is “flexible and willing to change” compared to other leftist approaches. “There’s been a huge generational shift of millennials who are going to reinvent the socialist project,” Duhalde said, adding that more than half of new members who joined since Trump’s victory are younger than 30.
Many new members say they heard about the group on Twitter, where Democratic Socialists of America members and supporters often put red rose emojis next to their user handles, an armband for the digital era. New enlistees have posted photos of their membership cards, which show their names along with the title “official socialist organizer.”

One of the group’s biggest online boosters is the actor and comedian Rob Delaney, star of the TV show “Catastrophe,” a Sanders supporter who regularly exhorts his 1.36 million Twitter followers to join the Democratic Socialists of America.
Like many DSA members, Delaney favors single-payer healthcare, in which the government covers healthcare costs, and he’s been impressed by the government-run National Health Service in Britain, where he films his show. He once carried $50,000 in medical debt in the U.S. following surgeries he’d needed after a car accident even though he was insured, and he thinks the system is unfair to women as well as the poor.
“If you’re not lying to yourself you recognize that income inequality and systemic racism/misogyny work really really well to keep the poor poor and make the rich richer. And that’s not okay to me,” Delaney said in private messages on Twitter.
“DSA’s ideas weave all that together in a very pragmatic and actionable way. And they’re fantastic organizers,” Delaney continued. “DSA espouses and promotes these issues in a way I really really like and believe is the best way to defeat Trump and the GOP.”

","President-elect Joe Biden is expected to sign 15 executive actions upon taking office Wednesday, immediately reversing key Trump administration policies.
Why it matters: The 15 actions — aimed at issues like climate change and immigration — mark more drastic immediate steps compared with the two day-one actions from Biden's four predecessors combined, according to incoming White House press secretary Jen Psaki.
What they're saying: The actions are the first of many, Psaki said in a news release, as Biden works ""to address the four crises that he's laid out"" — COVID-19, the economic crisis, racial injustice and climate change.
""In the coming days and weeks we will be announcing additional executive actions that confront these challenges and deliver on the President-elect's promises to the American people,"" Psaki said, ""including revoking the ban on military service by transgender Americans, and reversing the Mexico City policy.""

","Researchers see one bright spot as far-right extremists turn to private and encrypted online platforms: Friction.
Between the lines: For fringe organizers, those platforms may provide more security than open social networks, but they make it harder to recruit new members.
Catch up quick: The online far right is moving away from mainstream social networks and onto both right-wing-welcoming networks like Gab and privacy-friendly platforms like Telegram and Signal, due largely to the collision of three events:
Public social media activity left a trail that's been exposing the identities of a growing list of Capitol rioters.
The far right is exiting large social networks, either as a political statement or under force of a ban, as tech platforms crack down on extremists.
WhatsApp botched the rollout of a new privacy policy, confusing and worrying a massive number of users of all political stripes who then went looking for alternatives.
The catch: As the fringe right burrows underground, experts say it will quickly learn how much harder it is to organize there than on wide-open channels like Facebook and Twitter.
Here's why:
1) Every added step is a chance to lose a follower.
Having to download apps and go through steps to verify their identities is bound to dissuade people from joining, said Matt Mitchell, a technology fellow at the Ford Foundation.
And when a platform goes down — as an extended Signal outage Friday illustrated — it cuts off the intake entirely.
2) You don't always know who you're talking to. It can be trivially easy in some cases for outsiders to infiltrate private online groups — something not lost on extremists.
""We're seeing more recognition among groups on platforms like Telegram, Gab and MeWe that there are security researchers, law enforcement officials and journalists in these groups,"" said Bryce Webster-Jacobsen, Director of Intelligence at cyber intelligence firm GroupSense.
3) You can still be deplatformed even on private or semi-private forums.
4) Out of sight, out of mind. Experts say domestic terrorists face a similar problem that groups like ISIS have faced after being deplatformed: recruiting gets harder.
When images and videos are removed from more public platforms, it becomes more difficult for hate groups to draw in fresh members.
Yes, but: Research shows that when fringe groups are banned from mainstream platforms, the bans often push bad actors to even darker parts of the web, where the conversation becomes even more toxic.
That means that while far-right groups may have a harder time drawing in fresh blood than they did on mainstream social networks, the ones that do show up could be more dedicated to the cause.
What's next: The scrutiny (and channel deletions) now rising among the alternative platforms could create smaller and even more radical splinter groups."

","A wrongful death lawsuit tied to COVID-19 infections in a Waterloo pork processing plant alleges that during the initial stages of the pandemic, Tyson Foods ordered employees to report for work while supervisors privately wagered money on the number of workers who would be sickened by the deadly virus.
Earlier this year, the family of the late Isidro Fernandez sued the meatpacking company, alleging Fernandez was exposed to the coronavirus at the Waterloo plant where he worked. The lawsuit alleges Tyson Foods is guilty of a “willful and wanton disregard for workplace safety.”
In a written statement issued Thursday afternoon, Tyson Foods’ president and chief executive officer, Dean Banks, said: “We are extremely upset about the accusations involving some of the leadership at our Waterloo plant. Tyson Foods is a family company with 139,000 team members and these allegations do not represent who we are, or our core values and team behaviors. We expect every team member at Tyson Foods to operate with the utmost integrity and care in everything we do.
“We have suspended, without pay, the individuals allegedly involved and have retained the law firm Covington & Burling LLP to conduct an independent investigation led by former Attorney General Eric Holder. If these claims are confirmed, we’ll take all measures necessary to root out and remove this disturbing behavior from our company.
“Our top priority is and remains the health and safety of our team members.”
Fernandez, who died on April 20, was one of at least five Waterloo plant employees who died of the virus. According to the Black Hawk County Health Department, more than 1,000 workers at the plant — over a third of the facility’s workforce — contracted the virus.
The lawsuit alleges that despite the uncontrolled spread of the virus at the plant, Tyson required its employees to work long hours in cramped conditions without providing the appropriate personal protective equipment and without ensuring workplace-safety measures were followed.
The lawsuit was recently amended and includes a number of new allegations against the company and plant officials. Among them:
In mid-April, around the time Black Hawk County Sherriff Tony Thompson visited the plant and reported the working conditions there “shook [him] to the core,” plant manager Tom Hart organized a cash-buy-in, winner-take-all, betting pool for supervisors and managers to wager how many plant employees would test positive for COVID-19.
John Casey, an upper-level manager at the plant, is alleged to have explicitly directed supervisors to ignore symptoms of COVID-19, telling them to show up to work even if they were exhibiting symptoms of the virus. Casey reportedly referred to COVID-19 as the “glorified flu” and told workers not to worry about it because “it’s not a big deal” and “everyone is going to get it.” On one occasion, Casey intercepted a sick supervisor who was on his way to be tested and ordered him to get back to work, saying, “We all have symptoms — you have a job to do.” After one employee vomited on the production line, managers reportedly allowed the man to continue working and then return to work the next day.
In late March or early April, as the pandemic spread across Iowa, managers at the Waterloo plant reportedly began avoiding the plant floor for fear of contracting the virus. As a result, they increasingly delegated managerial authority and responsibilities to low-level supervisors who had no management training or experience. The supervisors did not require truck drivers and subcontractors to have their temperatures checked before entering the plant.
In March and April, plant supervisors falsely denied the existence of any confirmed cases or positive tests for COVID-19 within the plant, and allegedly told workers they had a responsibility to keep working to ensure Americans didn’t go hungry as the result of a shutdown.
Tyson paid out $500 “thank you bonuses” to employees who turned up for every scheduled shift for three months — a policy decision that allegedly incentivized sick workers to continue reporting for work.
Tyson executives allegedly lobbied Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds for COVID-19 liability protections that would shield the company from lawsuits, and successfully lobbied the governor to declare that only the state government, not local governments, had the authority to close businesses in response to the pandemic.
While Tyson has yet to file a formal response to the new allegations, it has said in previous court filings that it “vigorously disputes” the plaintiffs’ claims and has “invested millions of dollars to provide employees with safety and risk-mitigation equipment.”
The lawsuit claims that while Tyson has repeatedly claimed that its operations needed to remain open to feed America, the company increased its exports to China by 600% during the first quarter of 2020.
The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages for fraudulent misrepresentation and gross negligence.
The case was initially filed in state court, claiming violations of Iowa law. At Tyson’s request, the case was moved to federal court, with the company claiming it had remained open during the pandemic “at the direction of a federal officer” — President Donald Trump, who, on April 28, invoked his authority under the Defense Production Act and ordered meat and poultry processing companies to continue operating.
The nonprofit organization Public Citizen has filed an amicus brief in the case, supporting the Fernandez family’s efforts to remand the action back to state court. In its brief, Public Citizen has said that neither the Defense Production Act nor the executive order signed by President Trump had “directed” Tyson to do anything.
The Waterloo facility is Tyson’s largest pork plant in the United States. The facility employs approximately 2,800 workers who process approximately 19,500 hogs per day."

","At a time of rock-bottom joblessness, high corporate profits and a booming stock market, more than 40% of U.S. households cannot pay the basics of a middle-class lifestyle — rent, transportation, child care and a cellphone, according to a new study.
Quick take: The study, conducted by United Way, found a wide band of working U.S. households that live above the official poverty line, but below the cost of paying ordinary expenses. Based on 2016 data, there were 34.7 million households in that group — double the 16.1 million that are in actual poverty, project director Stephanie Hoopes tells Axios.
Why it matters: For two years, U.S. politics has been dominated by the anger and resentment of a self-identified ""forgotten"" class, some left behind economically and others threatened by changes to their way of life.
The United Way study, to be released publicly Thursday, suggests that the economically forgotten are a far bigger group than many studies assume — and, according to Hoopes, appear to be growing larger despite the improving economy.

between poverty and the middle class ""ALICE"" families, for Asset-limited, Income-constrained, Employed. (The map above, by Axios' Chris Canipe, depicts that state-by-state population in dark brown.) These are households with adults who are working but earning too little — 66% of Americans earn less than $20 an hour, or about $40,000 a year if they are working full time.
When you add them together with the people living in poverty, you get 51 million households. ""It's a magnitude of financial hardship that we haven't been able to capture until now,"" Hoopes said.
By the numbers: Using 2016 data collected from the states, the study found that North Dakota has the smallest population of combined poor and ALICE families, at 32% of its households. The largest is 49%, in California, Hawaii and New Mexico. ""49% is shocking. 32% is also shocking,"" Hoopes said."

","Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has soared and former Vice President Joe Biden has crashed in national preference for the Democratic nomination for president, while the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary helped to clear some running room for a candidate who's not yet been on the ballot: former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg.
Sanders advanced to 32% support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, up 8 percentage points from late January. Biden fell to 17%, down 11 points to his lowest of the campaign. And Bloomberg, who takes the stage for the first time in Wednesday night's debate in Nevada, now has 14% support, up 6 points.
See PDF for full results, charts, and tables.
By contrast, there's been little if any movement for former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a strong finisher in both early contests; Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, third in New Hampshire; or Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who fell short in both. Warren has 11% support nationally, unchanged; Buttigieg, 7%; and Klobuchar, 6%.
Sanders' newfound 15-point lead over Biden nearly doubles Biden's biggest lead of the campaign, 8 points over Sanders in early September. That said, the most dramatic shifts aren’t in vote preferences but in views of who has the best chance to defeat President Donald Trump in November. Electability's been a cornerstone of Biden's campaign, yet just 19% now say he's likeliest to win, sliced in half from 38% in January.
Instead, 30% of leaned Democrats now see Sanders as most electable, up 12 points, and 18% say this about Bloomberg, up 10 points. The rest of the field is in single digits on the question.
Among groups, Biden's support among blacks has declined from 51% last month to 32% now; he's been looking for support from blacks as a boost to his campaign in the South Carolina primary on Feb. 29. He lags with just 11% among whites. Sanders, meanwhile, is prevailing among Hispanics, potentially an influential group in the Nevada caucuses this Saturday. Nonwhites overall – who account for half of all Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents – have gone from 35-28 percent, Biden-Sanders, last month, to 35-22 percent, Sanders-Biden, now.
General election matchups have changed little from January in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates. Sanders, Bloomberg and Biden lead Trump by 8 to 11 points among all adults, but it's close among those who are registered to vote. Biden holds a slight 7-point edge over Trump among those who are registered to vote, while Sanders' +6 and Bloomberg's +5 fall short of statistically significant leads. All these extend January's contraction after sizable Democratic leads in the fall, with Trump boosted by the economy.
Trump
Trump's job approval rating is mostly steady at 43%, a point off his career-high, 44% last July and again last month. His approval rating for handling the economy is higher, 52%, after peaking at 56% last month.
On the economy, 53% of Americans say they're holding steady financially, 29% getting ahead and 16% falling behind. It's a key measure; a huge advantage for Trump among those who say they're getting ahead financially largely compensates for his trailing position among those who are holding steady or falling behind.
Trump's support in general election matchups is very consistent – 42 to 45% among all adults and 45 to 47% among registered voters, regardless of the six potential Democratic opponents tested. That's associated, naturally, with his job approval rating; 91 to 94% of his approvers support him for re-election. With re-election campaigns constituting a referendum on the incumbent, it's the reason to watch Trump's approval score – and the economy, which influences it – closely in the months ahead.
Trump retains two dubious distinctions: He's the first president in modern polling never to have achieved majority approval, and his career average rating is the lowest on record. He's at a new low in approval among Democrats (4%) and a high among Republicans (88% up 14 points from late October), for the widest partisan gap since he took office. He's got 46% approval among independents, often a swing group in national politics.
Another measure also marks the partisan divisions on Trump: Twenty-six percent of Americans say his behavior as president has ""changed for the worse"" since his acquittal on impeachment charges last month. That rises to 50% among Democrats, vs. 3% of Republicans, with independents between the two.
The Democrats
Defeating Trump in November is the party's prime motivation, and a potential limiting factor for Sanders despite his gains on the electability question. Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents by 58-38% say they'd prefer a candidate who can beat Trump over one who agrees with them on major issues. Sanders wins 46% support among those chiefly focused on issues, a margin that's largely responsible for his lead overall. That drops to 21% among the majority that cares more about defeating Trump, with Biden and Bloomberg competitive in this group.
At the same time, Sanders is boosted within the party by his support for a government-run, single-payer health care system to replace private insurance. Leaned Democrats back this approach by 62-34%. Among the majority who are single-payer supporters, Sanders has 44% support; among opponents of that system, just 12%.
On another front, Sanders doesn't face trouble within the Democratic ranks based on his self-definition as a Democratic socialist or socialist. (He's used both terms.) Given the ""Democratic socialist"" label, 20% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they're more likely to support him, vs. 8% less likely – a net positive. (Liberals are especially accepting of the term.) Using ""socialist,"" it's a wash – 12% more likely, 13% less so. Two-thirds or more say it doesn't matter to them.
Both the label and Sanders' position on health care may be less helpful, though, in a general election. Americans overall are more apt to oppose than to support single-payer government health care, 52-41%. And Sanders' calling himself a democratic socialist or a socialist turns into a net negative in vote intention among all adults; they're less likely rather than more likely to support Sanders by 31-11% given the democratic socialist label and by 38-8% as a socialist. The share saying it makes no difference drops closer to half.
Similarly, about a third of all adults call Sanders ""too liberal,"" compared with about a quarter who say the same of Biden or Bloomberg. That said, 20% call Sanders too conservative.
Within the Democratic primaries, the competing forces of electability and views on health care are key for Sanders. So too, potentially, is the fate of the now-lagging Warren. Were she not in the race, a plurality of her supporters say they'd shift to Sanders (based on aggregated results from the last two ABC/Post polls for an adequate sample size). That said, were Biden to go, a quarter of his support could be Sanders-bound.
Among demographic groups, Sanders' support remains focused among liberal (and especially very liberal) leaned Democrats and young adults. He has a vast 56% support among 18- to 39-year-olds, diving to 13% among those age 65 and older. Among seniors, by contrast, Bloomberg reaches 24 percent; Biden, 20%.
Sanders' 41% among liberals falls to 25% among moderates, who account for more than four in 10 leaned Democrats (44%). Biden wins 24% of moderates, Bloomberg 17%. At the same time, relatively few leaned Democrats call Sanders ""too liberal,"" 17%; indeed, as many call him too conservative. The only significant ideological objections to any of the other leading candidates are to Klobuchar, seen as too conservative rather than too liberal by a 9-point margin, and Biden, the same by 6 points.
For his part, Bloomberg, despite controversies over ""stop and frisk"" policing in New York during his mayoralty, has about as much support from blacks (14%) and nonwhites generally (12%) as among whites (16%). Further, though he's been accused of sexism, his support is slightly higher among women (17%) than men (10%).
In a general election matchup among registered voters against Trump, moreover, Bloomberg is supported by 60% of women (vs. 39% of men) and by 71% of nonwhites (including 91% of blacks). Results among other leading Democrats are similar.
A final result finds some apprehension among leaned Democrats about their chances in November. About seven in 10 think Sanders, Biden or Bloomberg would beat Trump; that leaves about a quarter who think Trump would win these matchups. More – four in 10 – think Trump would beat either Warren or Buttigieg, and nearly half think he'd defeat Klobuchar.

","Over the weekend Bret Stephens had a smart column arguing that people should not discount the possibility that Bernie Sanders could win both the Democrat nomination and the presidency.
He’s right.
I mean, he’s right in the cosmic, moral sense because if we’re going to be honest with ourselves, Trump versus Sanders is the choice this country clearly deserves.
But he’s also right in the arithmetical sense.
The easy part is seeing Bernie’s path to the Democratic nomination. Nate Silver’s primary model gives him slightly better than a 1-in-5 chance to win the nomination outright and a 1-in-4 chance of winning a plurality of delegates. You don’t have to be doing Scott Steiner math to put those together and see a reasonably good chance that Sanders could be the nominee.
This isn’t to say that Sanders has the best shot to win the nomination. That’s clearly Joe Biden. But Sanders has the best shot, by far, to win both Iowa and New Hampshire and if he’s able to do that, then he will be in a one-on-one race with Biden and his odds of winning the nomination go way up, maybe even close to 50-50.
The second part is harder: Could Bernie beat Trump?
Podcast · March 05 2021 Philip Rucker on The Future of the 'Very Stable Genius' On today’s Bulwark podcast, Philip Rucker of The Washington Post joins host Charlie Sykes to talk about the updates to ...
If you were being cold-blooded about it and just thinking about probabilities, the answer is that Bernie has a smaller chance to beat Trump than Biden does. But maybe not as much smaller as you think.
Biden has led Trump in almost every general election match-up poll taken this cycle.
So has Sanders. His lead isn’t as large as Biden’s, but it’s real.
The difficulty becomes the Electoral College, where Sanders is notably weaker than Biden. But he’s also a little bit different.
This is Joe Biden’s path to winning the White House:
Biden is strong in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, because he does okay with both working-class whites and educated suburbanites. And he’s strong in Virginia and North Carolina because he does well with African-Americans and, again, educated suburbanites.
Bernie’s path to 270 is slightly different.
He’s not as strong as Biden in the Rust Belt, but he’s probably strong enough to get the job done. (Trump is in so much trouble in Michigan that Mike Bloomberg is +6 against him there.) But Bernie’s problems with educated suburban voters are probably enough to cost him Virginia and Florida. At which point he’s down to 280 electoral votes and he needs to hold on to everything else, or expand the map. Which would probably mean making big plays in Ohio and Iowa.
It’s important to understand that the Sanders and Biden coalitions might be similar in size, but they’d probably be slightly different in composition. I’d expect the two big differences to be:
Where Biden turns out more African-America voters, you’d expect Sanders to turn out more under-30 voters.
Where Biden would be okay with working-class whites and strong with college-educated suburban voters, Sanders would flip that around. Bernie would give back some of the suburbs while expanding his share of non-college white voters.
If I was a Democratic strategist trying to engineer the maximum number of votes, this is not a trade that I would want to make. But it’s still dangerous territory for Trump.
There’s a lot of talk about how Trump would hang “socialism” around Bernie’s neck. And I’m sure that would be the president’s major point of attack. But it’s not clear how effective that would be.
One of the defining features of the last three years has been an emerging argument from both the progressive left and the nationalist right that the free market is overrated.
Here’s Trump’s problem: How does the guy who expanded the government, blew up the national debt, and gave $28 billion in farm bailouts to subsidize the tariff war he started complain about Sanders not being a true-blue capitalist?
Don’t get me wrong. Trump certainly would make that argument, and it’ll probably work with the kind of marginal suburban voters he’d like to win back. What I mean is that there is a problem in that Trump has already told his base that the world is stacked against them and that the only way for them to get theirs is for the government to redistribute money in their favor.
So what happens when Sanders comes in saying, Hey, that billionaire buffoon said he was going to blow everything up, but things are still the same. Elect me and we’ll really change the system.
Again, if you’re on Team Trump, you’d rather take your chances with this argument, banking on the idea that your base is wedded more to white identity politics than it is to economic populism. That’s a good bet. But maybe not a lead-pipe cinch.
And by the way, if you want evidence that this is how Trump World does indeed see the race, watch how they’ve maneuvered in an attempt to draw Anybody But Biden:
Trump has gone out of his way not to take shots at Elizabeth Warren, who he viewed as the best possible matchup.
Trump literally got himself impeached in an attempt to damage Biden by demanding that the government of Ukraine make a public show of investigating Biden’s son.
Now Trump is loudly proclaiming that he’s shifting his focus to Bernie in an attempt to make Biden look weak and help give Bernie momentum going into Iowa.
The interesting thing is that against Biden, Trump would wage his normal, asymmetric warfare, where Biden can be expected to run a traditional campaign while Trump zigs and zags trying to disrupt the story.
But against Sanders, Trump would be the guy making the normal political arguments that every incumbent Republican president has made for 50 years—that other guy is a commie!—and playing defense against an unorthodox, disruptive Sanders campaign."

","Updated Wednesday, Feb. 17, 2021.
Roughly a dozen Portland police officers faced off with a small group at a Northeast Portland Fred Meyer on Tuesday after people tried to take food that had been thrown away.
Workers at the Hollywood West Fred Meyer threw away thousands of perishable items because the store, like many others, had lost power in an outage brought on by the region’s winter storm.
Images on social media showed mountains of packaged meat, cheese and juice, as well as whole turkeys and racks of ribs that had been tossed into two large dumpsters near the store.
A few people gathered about 2:30 p.m. at the store, 3030 N.E. Weidler St., in hopes of salvaging the food.
But within a few hours, people seeking food from the dumpsters began to report police officers showing up to guard the dumpsters and prevent people from taking the items.
Morgan Mckniff, a prominent activist and outspoken Portland police critic who lives in the neighborhood, said employees were guarding the dumpsters when they showed up to get some of the discarded food. Mckniff began to film the employees and reported staff members threatened to call the police on them for doing so.
The store manager called police shortly thereafter, Mckniff said, and Mckniff began livestreaming the interaction on Instagram.
“After that, other people started showing up and asking them, ‘Why are you guys guarding a dumpster?’” Mckniff said.
Mckniff said about 15 people eventually gathered in an attempt to collect food.
At that point, Mckniff said, a dozen officers arrived at the scene. One officer wasn’t wearing a mask and refused to put one on until a supervisor arrived and brought him one, according to Mckniff.
On Wednesday, Portland police said officers were sent to the scene after employees said “they felt the situation was escalating and feared there may be a physical confrontation,” a police spokesman said in a statement.
Also on Wednesday, a Fred Meyer spokesman responded to what had become a deluge of criticism, noting the company donates more than five million pounds of food annually.
“Unfortunately, due to loss of power at this store, some perishable food was no longer safe for donation to local hunger relief agencies,” the company wrote. “Our store team became concerned that area residents would consume the food and risk food borne illness, and they engaged local law enforcement out of an abundance of caution. We apologize for the confusion.”
Juniper Simonis, a well-known activist and researcher who arrived to document the police presence, said officers showed up and threatened those on hand with arrest — at which point the crowd moved across the street.
Simonis, also an environmental biologist and data scientist, said they took out their press badge and went closer to take photos of the officers, who were standing in front of the bins full of food.
“I’m just interacting with officers and trying to get their information, and then they say, ‘We’re going to arrest you if you don’t leave,’ and threatened me with trespassing,” Simonis said.
Simonis was bewildered by the threat of arrest.
“I was documenting the police, not what was in the dumpster,” they said. “I wasn’t going over there. And the police got the store manager to threaten me with trespassing.”
For their part, police said they tried to explain to the group that the food was spoiled, but “no subject in the crowd was willing to have an open dialogue with the officers and continued to shout insults at them and store employees,” a spokesman said.
Simonis said police eventually left and those waiting to get food made their way over to the dumpsters. As of 6:30 p.m., about two dozen people were at the dumpsters, taking a few items each.
Simonis noted that all the food was still in good condition, given the cold weather. One person picked up a carton of juice with an expiration date in March.
Both Mckniff and Simonis said the immediate action to prevent people from taking the discarded food speaks to the value the city places on providing aid to those in need.
The run-in also came as the region reeled from a winter storm that brought on widespread power outages that left many people unable to salvage perishable items in their refrigerators.
“The people who were there weren’t there for selfish reasons — they were there to get food to distribute to hungry people around the city,” Simonis said. “There are mutual aid groups that have been helping feed people at warming centers, because the city doesn’t have enough resources to feed them.”
Multnomah County kept emergency severe weather shelters open Monday, taking to social media to ask for volunteers to keep the doors open an additional night. More than 300,000 people and businesses lost power over the weekend, with nearly all of the area’s hotels filling up as people tried to escape the cold.
Mckniff said many of the people police threatened with arrest and turned away are regular customers of the store.
“I live in this neighborhood. This neighborhood doesn’t have power,” Mckniff said. “And Fred Meyer is telling people in this immediate community who shop here that they can’t have these things they’re throwing away. Cheese, pickles, yogurt — things that are intentionally cultured and cured.”
Simonis said it’s hard to rationalize the actions by police and the store.
“None of this makes sense to me except through the lens of severely ingrained policing and a culture of disrespect for human dignity,” they said.
They noted parallels between the Fred Meyer incident and Portland protests.
Simonis, for their part, is one of several plaintiffs in a lawsuit that alleges local, state and federal officers violated the rights of people with disabilities through aggressive police responses to the protests.
“Here it’s not broken windows, it’s tossed away but otherwise completely fine food,” Simonis said. “It’s not a bad situation or vandalism, it’s literally the exact opposite — feeding hungry people. Yet they still use the same apparatus to prevent anything from being done.”

","MIRAMAR, Fla. – While mourning his death, the family of the UPS driver killed in Thursday’s shootout in Miramar is also lashing out at police who they believe are responsible for the loss of life.
“They murdered him,” Joe Merino, the stepfather of Frank Ordonez, told Local 10 News. “I hope you can understand that and how I feel because it could have been prevented.”
While admitting he’s not a police officer, Merino wondered why there was a rush to open fire at the truck before other options were considered.
“I have common sense, like we all do, and it shows me, where’s the protocol? Where was protocol? Where was SWAT? Where was the hostage negotiator? Where was the sniper?”, Merino said. “They shot him dead!”
Merino believes police failed to consider the innocent victims, including his stepson, during the incident.
“The negligence, the irresponsibility, the lack of life, the lack of concern,"" Merino said. “The disregard for life for the victim.”

A former UPS employee himself, Merino said the video of the shootout is proof that police acted inappropriately at the scene, calling it the “wild, wild west.”
“There’s bullets everywhere,"" he said. ""It was a war zone. How can this happen in today’s day and age?”
Moments after Merino spoke with Local 10, Miami-Dade Police Director Juan Perez responded to the family’s claims in an interview with Local 10′s Andrew Perez.
“Their perceptions are because they have lost loved ones, so you can’t argue with the way they view things. They’re speaking with pure emotion and, again, I completely understand and I empathize with the loss of their family.”
Merino said the family remains in shock less 24 hours after Ordonez’s death, having not slept all night. He added that the family was frustrated about the original lack of communication from law enforcement officials regarding their son’s status.
Ordonez was killed after gunfire broke out between police and the two suspects who stole the UPS truck after an attempted armed robbery in Coral Gables. Police opened fire after the truck came to a stop on Miramar Parkway. Ordonez, the two suspects and an innocent bystander were killed.

Using the handle @Geneviemerino, “Genny” mourned the loss of her brother on Twitter, but also blames the police for his death.

Ordonez’s stepfather said he will continue to speak out against what he calls his son’s murder by police, claiming they were only protecting themselves when the shootout began.

","Hundreds of nurses and their allies from across the country rallied Monday outside the headquarters of the pharmaceutical industry's top lobbying group and plastered the GoFundMe pages of Americans ""suffering in an immoral healthcare system"" to the building's walls and windows.

The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, spends tens of millions of dollars a year lobbying on a variety of healthcare issues, and it is currently bankrolling efforts to crush Medicare for All.
""We are here today—at the headquarters of PhRMA—because this is the scene of a crime,"" said Zenei Cortez, president of National Nurses United (NNU), which organized the demonstration in Washington, D.C.
""The people inside this building spent $28 million on lobbying last year to keep prescription drug prices so unaffordable that some of our patients needlessly die,"" said Cortez.
Following their rally, nurses used Band-Aids to cover the walls of PhRMA's headquarters with the GoFundMe pages of Americans who have been forced to crowdsource their medical expenses under the for-profit healthcare system.
According to GoFundMe's CEO, a third of all donations on the fundraising platform go toward healthcare costs.
The nurses' day of action comes just 24 hours before the House Rules Committee is set to hold its first-ever congressional hearing on Medicare for All, which NNU celebrated as a ""historic"" step toward achieving a just and cost-effective healthcare system.
During a speech at Monday's rally, Renelsa Caudill, RN, told the audience that ""it is disgusting to me that profit comes from denying care.""

","Five days before seeking Chapter 11 protection, J.C. Penney awarded $7.5 million in bonuses to its top four executives. The retailer, which hasn't turned a profit since 2010, entered bankruptcy with more than $8 billion in debt. (Charles Krupa/AP)
The coronavirus recession tipped dozens of troubled companies into bankruptcy, setting off a rush of store closures, furloughs and layoffs. But several major brands, including Hertz Global, J.C. Penney and Neiman Marcus, doled out millions in executive bonuses just before filing for Chapter 11 protection, according to a Washington Post analysis of regulatory filings and court documents.
Since the pandemic took hold in March, at least 18 large companies have rewarded executives with six- and seven-figure payouts before asking bankruptcy courts to shield them from landlords, suppliers and other creditors while they restructured, the Post review found. They collectively meted out more than $135 million, documents show, while listing $79 billion in debts.
Labor experts and bankruptcy attorneys say the payouts are particularly egregious — and unjustifiable — during an economic crisis, and were timed to bypass a 2005 law passed specifically to prevent executives from prospering while their companies flailed.
“These are bonuses that unfairly enrich the very same corporate managers that led the company into bankruptcy,” said Brandon Rees, a deputy director at the AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest coalition of labor unions. “That unfairness is compounded by the fact that we’ve just experienced the worst unemployment rate since the Great Depression.""
[A running list of retailers that have filed for Chapter 11]
The retention bonuses, which range from $600,000 at the parent company of retailer New York & Co. to the $25 million awarded to executives at Chesapeake Energy, illustrate how the pandemic recession is exacerbating economic inequality in the starkest terms: Those same companies laid off tens of thousands of workers, the majority earning less than $29,000 a year.
Utobia Hornbuckle, 49, lost her job at Chuck E. Cheese’s corporate office near Dallas just as the nation was preparing to shut down. The part-time position booking birthday parties had been just enough to lift her out of homelessness, she said, allowing her to afford a motel room. She’d hoped it would eventually help her into a one-bedroom apartment that she could share with her daughter and three grandchildren.
But on March 17, she was furloughed from her $12.50-an-hour job. Six months later, she was among dozens of corporate employees laid off from the family-friendly restaurant chain.
During that time, Chuck E. Cheese’s parent company filed for bankruptcy, citing $2 billion in debt. But first it awarded nearly $3 million in bonuses to top executives, including $1.3 million to chief executive David McKillips, who had been with the company less than five months.

“Of course it makes me mad,” Hornbuckle said. “But that’s kind of the way of the world now: Big corporations do what they want to, and the rest of us — the peons, the small people — fall off our feet.""
CEC Entertainment, which owns Chuck E. Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But in a regulatory filing, it said the bonuses were designed to retain employees “while providing them with financial stability.”

Many companies have homed in on retention to justify bonuses because they cannot be attached to traditional motivators such as sales targets or stock valuations during bankruptcy. Experts said retaining executives — even those who may have overseen a company’s decline — is often seen as a way to maintain consistency and raise the chances that the company will successfully emerge from bankruptcy.
“Somebody has to run the company, and the thinking is that it’s better to have someone who knows the organization,” said Dayna Harris, a partner at executive compensation consulting firm Farient Advisors. “If the company is able to go through reorganization, then investors still get something at the end and some employees still have a job left. If you go to liquidation, then everybody’s done.”
[Where Joe Biden stands of bankruptcy protections]
Denver-based Extraction Oil & Gas awarded $6.7 million in retention bonuses a week before its June bankruptcy filing because its “historic compensation structure and performance metrics were ineffective in motivating and incentivizing the company’s workforce in our current environment,” spokesman Brian Cain said. The company has laid off more than 120 employees, or roughly 40 percent of its workforce, this year, according to reports.
Of the 17 other companies contacted by The Post besides Extraction Oil & Gas, 11 did not respond to requests for comment. Ascena Retail Group, Chesapeake Energy, Hertz, Intelsat, Neiman Marcus and Tuesday Morning declined to comment.

The issue of executive compensation has been contentious for years, emblematic of America’s widening income gap. In 2019, the CEOs of the nation’s largest companies made more than 320 times the salary of their average employee, data shows. Thirty years earlier, the ratio was 61 to 1.
The rise of pre-bankruptcy bonuses corresponds with the passage of 2005 legislation meant to stamp out such payouts during reorganization, attorneys say. The Post’s review found that companies typically awarded bonuses within weeks — or days in several cases — of filing for Chapter 11 protection.
“It’s become a standard solution: Pay the bonus before bankruptcy, so bankruptcy law doesn’t apply,” said Adam Levitin, a Georgetown University law professor whose work focuses on bankruptcy and financial regulation.
While companies use bonuses to keep top executives from leaving during critical and uncertain times, “that doesn’t really apply in this economic climate,” he said.
“Where are these executives going to go? It’s not like there’s much of a market for high-priced CEOs right now.”
Nell Minow, an expert in corporate governance and vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, believes such bonuses should be tied to specific metrics, such as resolving bankruptcy issues by a particular date or taking other steps to ensure the company’s long-term viability. If restructuring efforts fail, some companies will end up having to liquidate and shut down altogether.
“What we call this is ‘pay for pulse,’ ” she said. “There is absolutely no obligation other than being alive to earn these bonuses. They’re payments for sticking around — and there is no worse timing for that than in the middle of an economic and medical crisis.""

Five days before its Chapter 11 filing in May, J.C. Penney awarded $7.5 million to its four top executives, including CEO Jill Soltau. The department store chain, which hasn’t turned an annual profit in nearly a decade, entered bankruptcy with more than $8 billion in debt. It’s now working to close roughly 150 stores and eliminate thousands of jobs.
[What is Chapter 11 bankruptcy?]
Neither J.C. Penney nor representatives for Soltau responded to requests for comment.
Danyelle Ryone was furloughed from a J.C. Penney store in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., in March. A few weeks later, she learned through a Facebook post that her store was closing for good, which meant her job at the jewelry counter was gone, too.
Managers, she said, asked her to help liquidate the store but only for four hours a week. Instead, the 23-year-old filed for unemployment benefits and began looking for other work.
“It really shows how corporate businesses feel about their employees,” said Ryone, who now works at a bank. “They [are] literally profiting off of us losing our jobs.”
She has been through this before: Her last employer, Toys R Us, filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and shuttered all 735 stores — but not before awarding executives $8 million in bonuses. The company did not respond to a request for comment.
Chapter 11: The “reorganization” bankruptcy When a company files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, business operations continue while it works out a plan to restructure its debts and pay creditors. Though Chapter 11 is most commonly used for reorganization, it can be used to liquidate assets. Here’s how the process plays out: Declare Bankrupcty Petition with the bankruptcy court 1 The debtor files a voluntary petition outlining assets, liabilities, income, expenses and financial affairs. This process takes place in bankruptcy court under the supervision of a U.S. trustee. The courts charge a $1,167 case filing fee and $550 in miscellaneous fees. The Relief Automatic stay 2 The company continues to operate as usual, while an automatic stay provides a period of time in which creditors cannot pursue the debtor on any debt that arose before the filing. Stockholder’s personal assets aren’t at risk, only their stocks with the company. Meeting of Creditors 341 meeting 3 The U.S. trustee and creditors conduct a meeting to question the debtor under oath concerning their acts, conduct, property, financial affairs and the administration of the case. The debtor uses the tools of the Bankrutpcy Code to reject leases, contracts or object to claims. Making a Plan Disclosure statement and reorganization plan 4 The debtor submits a disclosure statement. This statement should contain enough information for a creditor to make an informed judgment about the debtor’s plan of reorganization. There’s a 120-day period to file a plan with the possibility of up to an 18-month extension. More Hearings Hearings on approval of disclosure statement and confirmation of the plan 5 After the disclosure statement is approved, the court could hold two or three confirmation hearings before a final plan is approved to deal with any objections that arose. A quick case could be less than six months, while one with major disputes could drag on for years. The Confirmation Distribution under the plan 6 The debtor is required to make payments and is bound by the provisions of the confirmed plan of reorganization. The plan creates new contractual rights, replacing pre-bankruptcy contracts. The company could be sold during the process if there’s a buyer. Case Closed A final decree 7 The case closes after the debtor has substantially carried out the plan and their estate has been “fully administered,” meaning all bankruptcy claims have been resolved. Other Outcomes Conversion to Chapter 7 or dismissal If the debtor fails to comply the with the Bankruptcy Code or court rules, the U.S. trustee or creditors may file a motion to have the case dismissed or converted to Chapter 7 for asset liquidation. In Chapter 7, legal fees are paid first, then creditors and lastly stockholders if money is left.

Some companies also have asked bankruptcy courts for permission to grant “incentive” bonuses during reorganization. Car rental giant Hertz, for example, paid out $16.2 million three days before its Chapter 11 filing in May, then asked the court if it could award another $14.6 million in incentive bonuses. The judge rejected the request, calling it “offensive,” but later approved a plan to pay managers as much as $8.2 million if they met certain financial goals. Hertz, which filed for bankruptcy with more than $24 billion in debt, has laid off 11,000 workers, or more than a third of its U.S. workforce, since March. The company declined to comment.
When most businesses were shutting down around his GNC store in March, Timothy Clark kept reporting to work. His job with the vitamin and nutrition retailer was considered “essential” — and he needed the paycheck — so he put aside his fears of catching the novel coronavirus or spreading it to his grandmother.
Three months in, GNC filed for bankruptcy and announced plans close at least 800 stores, including the one in Gibbstown, N.J., where Clark earned $10 an hour. All four store employees were let go, as were a “significant” number of colleagues.
But five days before the Chapter 11 filing, company executives collected nearly $4 million. CEO Kenneth Martindale’s bonus is among the few with a clawback clause: One-quarter of his $2.2 million payout must be returned if the company does not emerge from bankruptcy within a year. GNC and Martindale did not respond to requests for comment.
“I liked my job,” said Clark, 23, who now makes ends meet by delivering for DoorDash. But to “see how many people lost their jobs, compared to the money the executives made, gives me chills.”
Hornbuckle suspected bankruptcy was inevitable well before Chuck E. Cheese’s corporate parent filed in June. Working conditions had been declining for months at the chain’s headquarters in Irving, Tex., she and a colleague said. Managers had recently begun asking workers to pay for their own pizza at company-sponsored lunches.
She knew business was bad in early March because event and birthday party cancellations were piling up. She just didn’t realize she’d be out of work so quickly.
“I felt like I was barely crawling out of a barrel before,” she said. “Then the pandemic came, and it just knocked us back down again.”
Hornbuckle and her daughter, who works at a day-care center, pay $268 a week for their motel room. They rely on food stamps for groceries and don’t have much money left for anything else. For a while, when Hornbuckle was receiving an extra $600 a week in supplemental unemployment benefits, she was hopeful she’d be able to save up enough for an apartment. But that aid has expired, and there’s no telling when more federal stimulus might arrive.
So she keeps applying for jobs, hoping for a call back.
“We’re barely piecing together what we can,” she said. “My wheels are spinning all day long, constantly trying to figure out what I can do. All I want is some type of job with a decent salary so I can build my way back up."""

","In some states, hospitals are required to provide charity care to certain low-income and uninsured patients, but several advocacy groups told me that these patients sometimes get regular bills instead. “We were seeing hospitals sending debtors to debt collections without saying anything to the debt collectors” about charity care, says Emilia Morris, the legal director of Central California Legal Services. “The debt collectors are trying to collect these debts without making charity care available. The patient sometimes gets sued, gets a judgment entered against them, without ever having heard of charity care.”
In a statement, an American Hospital Association spokesperson told me that in 2017, hospitals provided more than $38 billion worth of care to patients who could not afford it otherwise. “Hospitals across the country strive to find ways to help under- and uninsured patients navigate the health system,” the spokesperson said. “Hospitals offer charity care programs, check public assistance to see if the patient qualifies and provide discounts to these patients when possible. Every day, America’s hospitals treat patients who can make only minimal payment, or no payment at all.”
Still, some patients do wind up with medical debt, which discourages them from seeking medical care, because they fear they will incur even more debt if they go to the doctor again. The debt can also worsen people’s credit, which can make it hard for them to live healthier lives by, say, moving to better neighborhoods. In the end, they get sicker, and risk plunging even further into debt.
The $26,203 bill wasn’t the last one Lockett would receive from the incident that April. A separate bill, for two doctors’ consultations during Lockett’s hospital stay, came on April 28, for $1,301. (She provided these bills to The Atlantic for verification.) That amount was added to several more charges, for various X-rays and other diagnostic tests, for a new bill totaling $2,617, which arrived a month later.
Another bill, in May, came from Grady EMS, an ambulance service, for $1,807, for picking her up “from the scene,” as well as “mileage.” This bill encouraged her to leave her feedback in an online survey for the chance to win a $50 Kroger card. Lockett says she called the company to try to work out a deal, and a month later, Grady EMS sent her a new, reduced bill for $1,084. (Grady EMS did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)
Lockett’s attempts to negotiate with the hospital were less successful. On April 26, Lockett received a letter from Chamberlin Edmonds, a service that said it works with Emory Healthcare and claimed it could help her “find government benefits,” such as Medicaid or Medicare, to help pay her bill. This might have led to some confusion. Lockett says she didn’t have or qualify for either Medicare or Medicaid. (Georgia did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, leaving about a quarter million low-income adults in a so-called Medicaid gap.) But she thinks her first call upon receiving the bills was not to the hospital, but to Chamberlin Edmonds, which she incorrectly assumed could help bring down the overall hospital bill. (Chamberlin Edmonds’s website no longer exists, and the company that acquired it did not respond to requests for comment.)"

","Dozens of maquiladora plants that agreed to the “20-32”—a 20 percent raise and a bonus of 32,000 pesos (US$1,700)—demanded by workers in Matamoros, Mexico, are escalating their reprisals against the historic wave of strikes that began in the city on January 12. This has included thousands of firings.

Dozens of maquiladora plants that agreed to the “20-32”—a 20 percent raise and a bonus of 32,000 pesos (US$1,700)—demanded by workers in Matamoros, Mexico, are escalating their reprisals against the historic wave of strikes that began in the city on January 12. This has included thousands of firings.
Rosalinda, a worker at Kearfott who has made public appeals for support from the international working class through the World Socialist Web Site, reported that she was fired this weekend along with 30 of the most militant workers. “We are still organizing to help those on strike and to keep battling those union leaders that have supported the companies, allowing them to step on the agreement,” she said, referring to a no-reprisal clause.
“Since the salary increased significantly, they don’t want to pay that. Moreover, they have ended the 40-hour week to continue with 48 hours for all fellow workers,” she added.
An Inteva worker told the WSWS that, after agreeing to the “20-32,” the company carried out a series of layoffs as maquiladoras “attempt to fire everyone, pay full severance, and force those who want to continue working to agree to 176 weekly pesos and not the [post-raise] 211 pesos. Some will change their business name to bring down salaries again. Of course, they’ll do this with the help of the trade union.”
The largest business umbrella organization in Mexico, the Business Coordinating Council (CCE) threatened up to 50,000 layoffs in Matamoros in response to “the invitations to carry out work stoppages in other cities.” Meanwhile, the maquiladora owners’ association, Index, which includes companies that produce 68 percent of Mexican exports, continue to appeal for the intervention of the administration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (also known as AMLO) of the ruling Movement for National Regeneration (MORENA) party and the union bureaucracy to stop the greater independent initiative by and militancy of rank-and-file workers across the country.
In the same state of Tamaulipas, about 200 metalworkers struck at a yard in the town of Altamira owned by the Spain-headquartered Dragados Offshore. Amid demands of up to 100 percent wage increases, this was followed Tuesday by a strike of 2,000 workers of the same company in a yard in the state of Veracruz about 20 miles south and, on Wednesday, by a blockade of the gates in Altamira, turning it into a total strike among the 2,900 workers.
The trade union, which belongs to the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), has feigned support for the actions while working to negotiate down the demands.
Today, after rejecting a 1 percent raise proposal and demanding 12 percent instead, workers at the Autonomous University of Mexico City (UACM) plan to join a wave of strikes across public universities that began 28 days ago with demands for a 20 percent raise at the Autonomous Metropolitan University. Workers there were inspired by the Matamoros rebellion. The Universities of Oaxaca, Coahuila and Chapingo are also on strike.
Hundreds of elementary and high-school teachers have also been on strike since January in the southern states of Oaxaca and Michoacán demanding unpaid allowances. For several weeks, they blocked crucial railways that severely affected trade through the largest Mexican seaport at Lázaro Cárdenas. About 1,000 striking teachers demonstrated in front of the Public Education Secretariat in Mexico City on Wednesday.
On Monday about 400 workers at three plants in Matamoros—Sigosa steelworks, Seyco Joits and Sistemas Estructurales y de Construcción— struck demanding the “20-32.” The associated local union, led by Javier Zuñiga García, has claimed to support the wildcat strikes while arguing that workers in these plants already make more than others in the city.
After partial stoppages since January 29, the 700 Coca-Cola workers in Matamoros at one of the largest bottling plants in Latin America have been on a full-fledged strike for two weeks in defiance of court rulings branding their action “illegal.”
Since Tuesday, about 500 workers at the Spring Window Fashions maquiladora in Ciudad Victoria, 200 miles southwest of Matamoros, have been striking, demanding to leave the trade union since it rejected their demands for a 16 percent raise. Claiming to be “independent” but belonging to the same right-wing CTM, the Industrial Maquiladora Union led by María Dolores Zúñiga convinced workers to transfer to her union.
Zúñiga canceled a planned strike earlier this month among 6,000 workers, agreeing to a 16 percent raise compared to the 30 percent demanded by workers. In response, one of these companies, Kemet, announced this week that it would eliminate two of its four shifts and fire 700 workers, with Zúñiga discarding any fight and simply advocating workers demand full severance pay.
After workers at Walmart in Matamoros and many other cities were planning to join the wave of wildcat strikes to demand the “20-32,” the Revolutionary Confederation of Workers and Peasants (CROC), affiliated with the right-wing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), quickly mobilized to enroll workers and take over negotiations to prevent the wildcat strikes. Instead, the CROC issued a strike announcement for March 20 involving about 90,000 of the 200,000 workers at Mexico’s biggest retailer. A Walmart spokeswoman told Reuters on Monday after speaking to the union that “the dialogue was positive.”
In Matamoros, 15 auto parts suppliers are still on strike. The Mexican Association of the Auto Industry (AMIA) noted to El Financiero on Monday that 80 percent of parts produced in the city go to the US and Canada, seriously crippling production at major plants there, and that within Mexico the strike has shut down production at three assembly plants and seven others have been affected.
The president of the Mexican Association of Cars Distributors (AMDA) summed up to the financial daily that companies in Matamoros have two options: appeal for police intervention or leave the city. “There is a sentiment of a lack of rule of law given how this situation was triggered and there is fear that the same could happen in other border cities like Ciudad Juárez,” he added.
On Tuesday, the president of the Mexican Confederation of Industrial Chambers (CONCAMIN), Francisco Cervantes Díaz, said they are working closely with the AMLO administration and MORENA senator and union leader, Napoleón Gómez Urrutia, to address the wave of “illegal” strikes. “The problem could extend to the Bajío region and the south of the country,” he warned.
Facing the growing challenge from below and the deepening of the crisis of global capitalism, the Mexican ruling class and its US imperialist bosses will act with increasing ruthlessness. As López Obrador accelerates the creation of a new National Guard for domestic military operations, the Central Bank and Goldman Sachs dramatically cut down their 2019 growth forecasts for Mexico this week—with the latter warning of “idiosyncratic factors like strikes.”
Meanwhile, the trade-union bureaucracy is working everywhere to co-opt, isolate and shut down each rank-and-file struggle, while strengthening its corrupt and corporatist collaboration with management and the state.
On the other hand, workers across North America and globally are going on the offensive after decades of a one-sided war by major corporations against their living standards. This year has seen 71,000 teachers from several states participate in a wave of strikes, while almost 2,000 workers at the Wabtec locomotive plant in Pennsylvania initiated Tuesday the first major strike in the manufacturing sector in three years, according to the Huffington Post. Resistance is also growing against General Motors’ plant closures in the US and Canada and mass layoffs by the largest automakers partly being used extort concessions out of the 140,000 US autoworkers facing contract negotiations later this year.
Workers entering the class struggle need to break decisively from the nationalist and pro-capitalist trade unions and parties to coordinate their struggles internationally against the same corporate and financial elite in a political and revolutionary movement for socialism."

","After Stinging Presidential Loss, Popular Vote Movement Gains Momentum In States
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP
An attempt at an Electoral College workaround is gaining momentum in the Mountain West.
Democrats in Colorado and New Mexico are pushing ahead with legislation to pledge their 14 collective electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote — no matter who wins each state.
The plan only goes into effect if the law passes in states representing an electoral majority. That threshold is 270 votes, which is the same number needed to win the presidency.
Democrats have been stung by the fact that President Trump's victory marked the second time in five cycles that a Democrat lost the presidency while winning the popular vote. 2016 was the most egregious example, with Hillary Clinton winning 3 million more votes than Donald Trump, but losing the election. It was the largest margin ever for someone who won the popular vote, but lost the Electoral College.
Proponents of the national popular vote measures have argued that it's not political, but Republicans, who have benefited in recent elections from the Electoral College system, disagree.
And while a majority of the country has expressed support for giving the presidency to the person who wins the most votes — 55 percent in the latest Pew Research Center poll — there are sharp partisan divides. Three-quarters of Democrats are in favor of amending the Constitution to do so, but less than a third of Republicans are.
So far, 11 states — including New York, California and New Jersey — have joined the effort along with the District of Columbia, putting the effort 98 votes short of its goal.
Colorado appears poised to join as the 12th state. The state legislature passed the bill Thursday, and Gov. Jared Polis is expected to sign it. In New Mexico, the legislation is awaiting consideration in the state Senate after the House approved it earlier this month.
If the bills pass, it would show the plan has momentum outside of the Coastal U.S., especially in places where Democrats have full control of state government.
John Koza devised the plan and chairs the organization behind it. Koza also co-invented the scratch lottery ticket and taught computer science at Stanford. He turned his attention to the Electoral College, however, after growing frustrated with ""winner-take-all"" laws.
Koza said the rules are why presidential candidates only campaign in a handful of states. He recognized what might be a potential loophole in the Constitution — that while the Electoral College is in the Constitution, nothing says a candidate who wins a state has to get all of its electoral votes.
""The political power to the choose the president was basically given by the founders to the state legislatures,"" Koza said. ""And over the years they've passed different laws specifying how to allocate their state's electoral votes.""
In fact, Maine and Nebraska do not have ""winner-take-all"" systems. They allocate their electoral votes to presidential candidates by congressional district, with an additional two electoral votes going to the winner of the state.
Colorado state Sen. Mike Foote, who's sponsoring legislation, insisted that it's not a partisan response to Trump's 2016 win. Rather, he said, it's about upholding the democratic principle of one person, one vote.
""It's about time that every vote in the country counts equally,"" he said. ""Right now, if you live in a state that is not a battleground state, then your vote doesn't count nearly as much.""
Bipartisan appeals have not gone far in Colorado. Not a single Republican voted for the bill as it moved through the state legislature. During a debate on the House floor, one Republican even suggested renaming the bill the ""We Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Hate Donald Trump Act of 2019.""
Republican state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg, who represents the plains east of Denver, worries about the impact of a popular vote on rural America. He said it would lead candidates to only campaign in the largest media markets, like New York and Los Angeles.
""You drop us from nine [electoral] votes to 5.5 million people, all of sudden Colorado is irrelevant,"" he said. ""This is all about making sure presidential candidates realize Colorado is important to the rest of the country.""
That partisan divide isn't limited to Colorado. Across the country, pollsters have seen a steep drop in Republican support for a popular vote for president since 2016. National Popular Vote's Koza said it has been much harder to get Republicans to support his plan in recent years.
While those opinions could change over time, it signals the compact is unlikely to succeed in the short-term. Only Democratic-leaning states have joined so far. Swing states, like Ohio and Florida, have the least reason to sign on, which means it likely needs support from deep red states.
There's also a broader question as to whether it would be constitutional. The Electoral College is clearly written into the nation's founding document. Some insist that Congress would have to approve it since it would overhaul national election procedures. Other scholars have argued that states can't bind their electors to voters outside their boundaries.
Koza insists Article II gives states broad power to decide how they choose electoral delegates. Still, he expects a series of lawsuits if enough of the National Popular Vote efforts went into effect.
Seth Masket, a political science professor at the University of Denver, said those legal battles are a long way off. In the short term, he sees it as a way to center a familiar debate over the unique way the country decides its president.
""It's about saying the status quo is unacceptable,"" he said. ""This might not be the best way of changing it, but it's at least a way of forcing some change and forcing some discussion of it.""

","President Donald Trump's reluctance to hold Saudi leadership accountable for the brutal murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi stemmed from a partly aspirational $110 billion arms deal between the U.S. and Saudia Arabia that was inflated at the direction of Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, according to two U.S. officials and three former White House officials.
Kushner, in a bid to symbolically solidify the new alliance between the Trump administration and Saudi Arabia while claiming a victory on the president's first foreign trip to Riyadh, pushed State and Defense officials to inflate the figure with arms exchanges that were aspirational at best, the officials said. Secretary of Defense James Mattis supported Kushner's effort and ultimately endorsed the memorandum, according to a former NSC official familiar with the matter.
“We need to sell them as much as possible,"" Kushner told colleagues at a national security council meeting weeks before the May 2017 summit in Saudi Arabia, according to an administration official familiar with the matter.
Another U.S. official said there was a back and forth between Kushner and Department of Defense and State officials on how to get to a larger number because the officials initially told Kushner that realistically they had about $15 billion worth of deals in works, based on the Saudi government's interest in a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missile system and maintenance of other systems.
But even that order has not been fulfilled.
The Saudis have bypassed the September deadline for one of the pricier items on the list -- the THAAD missile defense system.
A spokesperson for the National Security Council said that the White House, State Department and Department of Defense worked ""tirelessly"" with their Saudi counterparts to come up with the arms outlined in the memo, based on ""rigorous analysis of Saudi requirements and of optimal U.S. solutions.""
""This unprecedented level of cooperation and effort led directly to the Memorandum of Intent, which was signed at the summit,"" an NSC spokesperson said in a statement. ""The administration continues to make progress on the $110 billion in intended arms sales announced in May 2017.""
Kushner declined to comment for this story.
Kushner had taken the lead on organizing the trip because of his close relationship with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
According to the Washington Post, the CIA has concluded that bin Salman ordered the murder of Khashoggi, but Trump has claimed that the CIA report ""did not come to a conclusion.""
Since the deal was signed by Mattis and bin Salman in Riyadh, there has been minimal activity toward purchasing the defense equipment and arms laid out in the arms agreements and signed. According to the Department of Defense, of the original $110 billion, Saudi Arabia has signed Letters of Offer and Acceptance valued at around $14.5 billion for equipment, including helicopters, tanks, ships, weapons and training.
Many of these deals were negotiated during the Obama administration, but U.S. officials say Trump’s diplomatic pressure was effective in fulfilling the pending orders.
The memo of intent, seen by ABC News in a photograph and verified by a former White House official and first reported by the Washington Post last year, shows billion dollar price tags for what appear to be at vague deals far from being inked. Many of the details about the quantity and types of defense weapons to be purchased are not listed and are slated to be delivered after 2022 or have a “to be determined” delivery dates and quantities.
The president defended his decision to stand by Saudi Arabia in a statement on Wednesday cited Saudi Arabia's investments in the U.S. economy, including the vague arms agreement laid out in the memo of intent.
""This is a record amount of money,"" Trump said. ""It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, tremendous economic development, and much additional wealth for the United States. Of the $450 billion, $110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors.""
The photo of the memorandum of intent shows an agreement between the two countries with very little legal weight.
It states: ""This document does not create any authority to perform any work, award any contract, 'issue articles from stock', transfer funds, or otherwise obligate or create a binding commitment in any way either for the United States or the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.""
The state official described the five-page list of potential arms sales as items the Saudi officials had signaled interest in or were deemed among their needs by U.S. defense analysts.
In one instance, the document calls for an undetermined quantity of Mark VI patrol boats to be delivered at an undetermined date at a cost of $2 billion.
Also on the list, a C-130 J aircraft for $5.8 billion, but with delivery estimated between 2022-2026.
“They were asking us to put as much pressure on the Saudis as we could [to buy American arms],” said a former National Security Council official. “It was definitely being pushed on the Pentagon people to see what was possible with the Saudis.”
Brookings Institute defense strategy expert Michael O'Hanlon, who has seen the photograph of the letter of intent provided by ABC News, called it “amateurish quality.”
“It acknowledges it's not binding,” O’Hanlon told ABC News.
“It's a multi-billion dollar transaction with three short lines of information as if that's meaningful. It's like you're taking notes on the back of a napkin over dinner. It's not a contract. It’s the idea of putting all of these numbers in the interest for the biggest number you can find.”
One former senior National Security Council official said it’s not unusual to push for concrete deliverables to announce at major events, but the official called the scale and level of exaggeration of the $110 billion figure ""unprecedented.""
According to another one former National Security Council official, it wasn’t just about having an unprecedented deliverable on the world stage but also securing more favorable unit sales for the U.S. from defense companies like Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Having the arms in place in Saudi Arabia also made them accessible for U.S. forces, that former official added.
“These details raise even more questions about what is really driving the Trump administration’s refusal to crack down on Saudi Arabia’s behavior,"" said Democrat Rep. David Cicilline, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
""If Jared Kushner inflated the size of this arms deal, we need to figure out why. Congress should get to the bottom of this and work to impose stronger sanctions on the Saudi regime, thoroughly review our relations with Riyadh, and cut off assistance for Saudi efforts in Yemen that have created a massive humanitarian crisis.”
When Trump hosted bin Salman at the White House last year, he rattled off many of the names of the weapons proposed.
“Some of the things that we’re now working on and that have been ordered and will shortly be started in construction and delivered: the THAAD system -- $13 billion; the C-130 airplanes, the Hercules, great plane -- $3.8 billion; the Bradley vehicles -- that’s the tanks -- $1.2 billion; and the P-8 and the P-8 Poseidons -- $1.4 billion,"" Trump said.
Over his eight-year term, Obama engaged in $115 billion in arms deals with Saudi Arabia -- some of which were not finalized -- but never announced the deals in one blanketed package.
Since the death of Khashoggi, Trump has insisted the U.S. would be ""foolish"" to disrupt any potential weapons sales with the Saudis.
On Tuesday, Trump said, ""China and Russia would love to make $100 billion worth of military equipment for Saudi Arabia. ... That would be a big, fat, beautiful gift to Russia and China. They're not going to get that gift.""
A representative for the Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment.

","Sanders will likely announce an exploratory committee in the coming weeks, followed by a rally. One major early focus will be finding a campaign manager and other top-level staffers who are not white, and preferably not male, in light of his problems appealing to minority voters in 2016 and recent revelations of sexual harassment by lower-level staffers on the 2016 campaign. Staff interviews have been quietly under way.
But a core team of advisers will return from 2016, spearheaded by Sanders’s wife and closest adviser, Jane O’Meara Sanders.
Peter Beinart: Bernie Sanders offers a foreign policy for the common man
His aides know this race will be different from his 2016 run against Hillary Clinton, when he surprised even himself with how close he came to knocking her off. Democratic leaders have been impressed by the extent to which the ideas from his campaign have carried forward, injecting far-left populism into the mainstream of Democratic politics—even as many in the party still bitterly point to his candidacy as weakening Clinton to the point that Trump was able to win.
Sanders has heard the argument that his stature would be diminished by running again if he doesn’t end up winning the nomination. He’s heard the argument that he might split the progressive vote and allow a more moderate candidate to win, but that hasn’t moved him either. That’s not how Sanders thinks, people who know him point out.
“He understands what happens in the streets is what prompts actions in Washington,” said Vincent Fort, a former Georgia state senator who supported the last campaign and has been in touch with Sanders’s team about this campaign.
There are also the nuts-and-bolts political considerations that Sanders doesn’t focus as much on, but that his team pays close attention to: He’s the one with the massive email list. Alone among those eyeing the Democratic nomination, he’s the one who had 40,000 people watching various live-streams of his State of the Union response. He’s the one whose team thinks he could, on day one, raise more money online and get more attention than any of the other candidates.
Sanders believes that he continues to have the strength in Iowa and New Hampshire to either win or come close there—especially with other candidates fragmenting support and lowering the bar for what it will take to win. Likewise, in a South Carolina primary that has both Cory Booker and Kamala Harris competing for African American votes and, likely, Joe Biden drawing on his own decades of connections there, Sanders sees a path to slip through and win.
Biden in the race, after all, would make it so that the senator isn’t the only white man in his 70s in the field.
If the early states all come together, Sanders would be positioned to power through the front-ended primary calendar that has California, Texas, and several other big states voting on the first Super Tuesday, March 4, just a month after Iowa. No one else in the field has anything like his proven success with both grassroots supporters and the small-dollar online fundraising that it will take to fund the kind of massive national operation any 2020 campaign will require."
demsocialist,"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/18/biden-governors-minimum-wage-469898
","POLITICO Dispatch: February 19 A few weeks ago, it looked like Andrew Cuomo was on track to break a New York curse and make it past a third term in office. But now, roiled in a Covid scandal, his political future is looking less certain.
His comments drew pushback from fellow Democrats, who have argued that raising the minimum wage isn’t just necessary for an economically-battered country but is sound politics as well. They have urged the White House to find avenues for making it reconciliation-compliant, to push party members skeptical of a major minimum wage hike to get on board and to consider the procedural nuclear option of having the party—with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as the tie-breaking vote—overrule the parliamentarian.
“Given the makeup of the Senate, this is our best opportunity and the right moment in the midst of this pandemic, to give millions of workers a long overdue raise,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the progressive caucus chair, said on a press call with reporters on Thursday.
Biden’s suggestion to mayors and governors, that they start preparing for the absence of a minimum wage hike in the Covid bill, suggests what has been hinted at elsewhere: He is reluctant to deploy such strong-arm options.
“President Biden has been consistent in private and public about his commitment to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which is why he included it in his first major piece of legislation,” said White House spokesperson Mike Gwin. “That commitment will remain unshaken whether or not this can be done through reconciliation.”
The meeting with state and local leaders included a wide-ranging conversation with Biden, touching on everything from municipal assistance to the importance of reopening schools, with Biden sharing concerns about how shuttered classrooms are impacting working mothers. But some in the room made a point of pushing back on his proposal to include the higher, $15 minimum wage in the $1.9 trillion relief package.
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, one of four Republicans at the meeting, stressed to Biden and the group that he didn’t think raising the wage was directly related to the immediate problems caused by the pandemic, according to two of the sources. Biden didn’t push back on Hogan’s point at the time. Nor was there a protracted discussion on the minimum wage. The conversation simply moved on.
Hogan also urged Biden to help ensure that the package was as bipartisan as he could, a point another official in the room said the president appeared receptive to.
“I really need your help on this,” Biden told the group. “It needs to be bipartisan.”
Democratic attendees at the meeting included New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, New Orleans Mayor Latoya Cantrell and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan. The Republicans were Hogan, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, Arlington, Tex. Mayor Jeff Williams and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.

","Amazon is looking to hire two intelligence analysts to track ""labor organizing threats"" within the company.
The company recently posted two job listings for analysts that can keep an eye on sensitive and confidential topics ""including labor organizing threats against the company."" Amazon is looking to hire an ""Intelligence Analyst"" and a ""Sr Intelligence Analyst"" for its Global Security Operations’ (GSO) Global Intelligence Program (GIP), the team that's responsible for physical and corporate security operations such as insider threats and industrial espionage.

The job ads list several kinds of threats, such as ""protests, geopolitical crises, conflicts impacting operations,"" but focuses on ""organized labor"" in particular, mentioning it three times in one of the listings.
Amazon has historically been hostile to workers attempting to form a union or organize any kind of collective action. Last year, an Amazon spokesperson accused unions of exploiting Prime Day ""to raise awareness to their cause"" and increase membership dues. Earlier this year, the company fired Christian Smalls, a Black employee who led a protest at a fulfillment center in New York over Amazon's inadequate safety measures in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. During a meeting with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, company executives discussed plans to smear Smalls calling him ""not smart, or articulate.""
These job listings show Amazon sees labor organizing as one of the biggest threats to its existence.

After this story was published, Amazon deleted the job listings and company spokesperson Maria Boschetti said in an email that ""the job post was not an accurate description of the role— it was made in error and has since been corrected."" The spokesperson did not respond to follow-up questions about the alleged mistake. The job listing, according to Amazon's own job portal, had been up since January 6, 2020.

""Workers, especially Black workers, have been telling us all for months that Amazon is targeting them for speaking out. This job description is proof that Amazon intends to continue on this course,"" Rajendra told Motherboard in a statement. ""The public deserves to know whether Amazon will continue to fill these positions, even if they’re no longer publicly posted.""

In the video, a crowd cheers a bus driver who appears to be refusing to sit behind the wheel: “the NYPD is using a bus to transfer arrested protesters at the Barclays Center,” @berniebromanny, who shared the video, tweeted. “However, the bus driver refused to drive it.” The video was viewed more than a million times in just over an hour.

Motherboard has confirmed that this is the official position of the union that represents MTA bus drivers.
“None of our bus ops should be used for that. We didn't do it during Zucotti Park/Occupy Wall St. went to court against this,” JP Patafio, vice president of Transit Workers Union Local 100, which represents the city’s bus drivers, told Motherboard when asked if the union would transport people who were arrested.

“I told MTA our ops wont be used to drive cops around,” he added. ""It is in solidarity"" with Minneapolis' bus drivers.

In 2011, the union sued to prevent the New York Police Department from commandeering buses and forcing city drivers to transport arrested Occupy Wall Street protesters for the cops.
In recent days, bus drivers in Minneapolis have similarly refused to transport arrested protesters for the cops, and unionized workers across the city have shown solidarity with protesters who are demonstrating against the police killing of George Floyd and police brutality more broadly."

SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Some immigrant U.S. Army reservists and recruits who enlisted in the military with a promised path to citizenship are being abruptly discharged, the Associated Press has learned.
The AP was unable to quantify how many men and women who enlisted through the special recruitment program have been booted from the Army, but immigration attorneys say they know of more than 40 who have been discharged or whose status has become questionable, jeopardizing their futures.

“It was my dream to serve in the military,” said reservist Lucas Calixto, a Brazilian immigrant who filed a lawsuit against the Army last week. “Since this country has been so good to me, I thought it was the least I could do to give back to my adopted country and serve in the United States military.”
Some of the service members say they were not told why they were being discharged. Others who pressed for answers said the Army informed them they’d been labeled as security risks because they have relatives abroad or because the Defense Department had not completed background checks on them.
Spokespeople for the Pentagon and the Army said that, due to the pending litigation, they were unable to explain the discharges or respond to questions about whether there have been policy changes in any of the military branches.
Eligible recruits are required to have legal status in the U.S., such as a student visa, before enlisting. More than 5,000 immigrants were recruited into the program in 2016, and an estimated 10,000 are currently serving. Most go the Army, but some also go to the other military branches.
To become citizens, the service members need an honorable service designation, which can come after even just a few days at boot camp. But the recently discharged service members have had their basic training delayed, so they can’t be naturalized.
Margaret Stock, an Alaska-based immigration attorney and a retired Army Reserve lieutenant colonel who helped create the immigrant recruitment program, said she’s been inundated over the past several days by recruits who have been abruptly discharged.
All had signed enlistment contracts and taken an Army oath, Stock said. Many were reservists who had been attending unit drills, receiving pay and undergoing training, while others had been in a “delayed entry” program, she said.
“Immigrants have been serving in the Army since 1775,” Stock said. “We wouldn’t have won the revolution without immigrants. And we’re not going to win the global war on terrorism today without immigrants.”

Stock said the service members she’s heard from had been told the Defense Department had not managed to put them through extensive background checks, which include CIA, FBI and National Intelligence Agency screenings and counterintelligence interviews. Therefore, by default, they do not meet the background check requirement.
“It’s a vicious cycle,” she said.
The AP interviewed Calixto and recruits from Pakistan and Iran, all of whom said they were devastated by their unexpected discharges.
“Now the great feeling I had when I enlisted is going down the drain,” said Calixto, 28. “I don’t understand why this is happening.”
In hopes of undoing the discharge, he filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., last week alleging the Defense Department hadn’t given him a chance to defend himself or appeal. He said he was given no specific grounds other than “personnel security.”
Calixto, who lives in Massachusetts and came to the U.S. when he was 12, said in an email interview arranged through his attorney that he joined the Army out of patriotism.
In the suit, Calixto said he learned he was being kicked out soon after he was promoted to private second class.
The Pakistani service member who spoke to the AP said he learned in a phone call a few weeks ago that his military career was over.
“There were so many tears in my eyes that my hands couldn’t move fast enough to wipe them away,” he said. “I was devastated, because I love the U.S. and was so honored to be able to serve this great country.”
He asked that his name be withheld because he fears he might be forced to return to Pakistan, where he could face danger as a former U.S. Army enlistee.
Portions of the 22-year-old’s military file reviewed by the AP said he was so deeply loyal to the U.S. that his relationships with his family and fiancee in Pakistan would not make him a security threat. Nonetheless, the documents show the Army cited those foreign ties as a concern.
The man had enlisted in April 2016 anticipating he’d be a citizen within months, but faced a series of delays. He had been slated to ship out to basic training in January 2017, but that also was delayed.
An Iranian citizen who came to the U.S. for a graduate degree in engineering told the AP that he enlisted in the program hoping to gain medical training. He said he had felt proud that he was “pursuing everything legally and living an honorable life.”
In recent weeks, he said, he learned that he’d been discharged.
“It’s terrible because I put my life in the line for this country, but I feel like I’m being treated like trash,” he said. “If I am not eligible to become a U.S. citizen, I am really scared to return to my country.”
He spoke on condition of anonymity because of those fears.
It’s unclear how the service members’ discharges could affect their status as legal immigrants.
In a statement, the Defense Department said: “All service members (i.e. contracted recruits, active duty, Guard and Reserve) and those with an honorable discharge are protected from deportation.”
However, immigration attorneys told the AP that many immigrants let go in recent weeks were an “uncharacterized discharge,” neither dishonorable nor honorable.
The service members affected by the recent discharges all enlisted in recent years under a special program aimed at bringing medical specialists and fluent speakers of 44 sought-after languages into the military. The idea, according to the Defense Department, was to “recognize their contribution and sacrifice.”
President George W. Bush ordered “expedited naturalization” for immigrant soldiers in 2002 in an effort to swell military ranks. Seven years later the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program, known as MAVNI, became an official recruiting program.
It came under fire from conservatives when President Barack Obama added DACA recipients — young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally — to the list of eligible enlistees. In response, the military layered on additional security clearances for recruits to pass before heading to boot camp.
The Trump Administration added even more hurdles, creating a backlog within the Defense Department. Last fall, hundreds of recruits still in the enlistment process had their contracts canceled. A few months later, the military suspended MAVNI.
Republican Congressman Andy Harris of Maryland, who has supported legislation to limit the program, told the AP that MAVNI was established by executive order and never properly authorized by Congress.
“Our military must prioritize enlisting American citizens, and restore the MAVNI program to its specialized, limited scope,” he said.
Non-U.S. citizens have served in the military since the Revolutionary War, when Continental soldiers included Irish, French and Germans. The U.S. recruited Filipino nationals to serve in the Navy in the 1940s, and worked to enlist Eastern Europeans in the military over the next decade, according to the Defense Department.
Since Sept. 11, 2001, nearly 110,000 members of the Armed Forces have gained citizenship by serving in the U.S. military, according to the Defense Department.
Many service members recruited through the program have proven to be exemplary. In 2012, then-Sgt. Saral K. Shrestha, originally from Nepal, was named U.S. Army Soldier of the Year.
In general, the immigrant recruits have been more cost-effective, outperforming their fellow soldiers in the areas of attrition, performance, education and promotions, according to a recently released review by the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research institution.
The AP spoke with a 26-year-old woman from Dominica who said she proudly enlisted in the immigrant recruitment program in 2016 while earning her nursing degree. She said she drilled each month with her reserve unit, which gave her an award, and had been awaiting a date to start basic training.
But in March, she said she looked up her profile on an Army portal and saw that the section about her security eligibility was marked “loss of jurisdiction,” with no further explanation. The next month, her attorney said she found the reservist’s name listed as “unsuitable” on a spreadsheet created by the Defense Department.
The reservist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about her legal standing, said she received additional paperwork last month that indicated her case is awaiting a final decision.
“I have always been a good soldier and have always done what they ask me to do,” she said. “I got into debt when I joined the Army because I can’t work legally but, financially, I can’t survive anymore. I don’t want to give up because I genuinely like being in the Army. But I don’t know who to turn to.”
In recent years, a group of attorneys have been fighting to keep their recruited immigrant clients eligible for naturalization as delays have mounted. Some have been successful, including nearly 50 recruits who were granted a type of temporary status while their background investigations are being completed.
“Some of our clients have finally emerged through the system and at least are doing basic training,” said Donald Friedman, a Washington attorney with Perkins Coie.

","A contentious union campaign by the staff of the progressive news network The Young Turks (TYT) is growing even more combative. Today, the union filed two separate unfair labor practice charges alleging that the company and its CEO, the popular liberal media figure Cenk Uygur, withheld wage increases and bonuses from employees as a result of the union drive, and that they fired an employee as retaliation for union activity — charges that Uygur denies.
On February 12, about 15 TYT employees announced their intention to unionize with IATSE. They expected to gain voluntary recognition from their famously liberal employer through a simple check of union cards, but were spurned. The company insisted on holding a secret ballot election at work in order to recognize the union, a tactic typically considered to be anti-union. (Uygur disputed this, telling In These Times that ​“Voluntary recognition means any recognition process outside of an NLRB election.” But card check is generally understood to be what unions mean by ​“voluntary recognition.”)
In a tense staff meeting held the same day, Uygur urged staffers not to unionize, saying a union would be unsustainable given TYT’s perilous financial position. Uygur’s position on the union has been widely criticized as hypocritical, coming from a man who made his name as a champion of progressive causes. TYT bills itself as the largest online news show in the world, with more than 200 million views per month.
Uygur, who at the time was running for Congress in California’s 25th district, also suggested that the union fight was politically motivated, since IATSE was endorsing one of his opponents in the race. On Tuesday, Uygur lost the race, coming in fourth with about 5% of the vote.
An employee of TYT involved in the union effort, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation, said that the workers’ annual discretionary raises — which represent a significant amount of money in a workplace where pay is already low — were scheduled to go into effect at the same time the union drive was announced. Shortly afterwards, according to the worker, employees involved in the union drive were told that ​“they were gonna have to delay our raises and bonuses until the union stuff got sorted out.” The worker said that employees who are not in the proposed collective bargaining unit did get their raises.
One unfair labor practice charge filed at the National Labor Relations Board by IATSE today says that TYT is guilty of ​“withholding predetermined wage increases and bonuses in response to a Union’s demand for voluntary recognition.” Uygur said that the company was simply maintaining the status quo while the union drive was active. ​“Frankly, we can’t win, because we all know that if we gave the raises, IATSE would be accusing us of bribing employees not to support the union,” he said. ​“If IATSE doesn’t object to TYT giving the raises, we would be more than happy to do so.”
The employee fired today was Jacorey Palmer, a technical director who occasionally appeared on the show as well. Palmer said that he was the employee who was ​“reprimanded” by Uygur for smiling during the meeting when the union was first announced, an incident reported by Huffpost. ​“His first day back acting as head of the company, after his congressional campaign ended, he fired me with no clear explanation,” Palmer said. ​“I have no doubt that this was in connection to my coworkers and I organizing for a voice at work. It was meant not only to remove a perceived trouble maker but also as a warning shot to my coworkers. Without a doubt, this was retaliatory.”
“Throughout my time at TYT I had made myself known as someone unafraid to vocalize injustices, especially in cases for fair treatment for my coworkers,” he added. ​“I found management very abrasive each time I tried to voice concerns my co-workers had brought to my attention. Each time I hoped their progressive politics would govern their response and each time I was wrong.”
Uygur said the company had ​“no knowledge regarding the employee’s support for the union or lack thereof,” and that the firing was justified. ​“TYT’s practice is to refrain from sharing details regarding personnel matters. However, since IATSE has accused us of wrongdoing, we will respond in this case,” Uygur said. ​“There was an employee fired this week for violating the Company’s anti-harassment policy. TYT’s ongoing engagement with this employee and disciplinary warnings regarding his misconduct date back several months, predating any communications from the union. Recently, we received several new complaints regarding the employee’s behavior from that former employee’s colleagues. The complaints were fully investigated and the Company took appropriate action.”
In response, Palmer said, ​“All of the incidents they are referring to are incidents of me speaking up for my coworkers about injustice in the workplace.”
The uproar over the raises and the dismissal has only added to the level of dissatisfaction inside TYT. Employees are also upset that the company is trying to reduce the size of the bargaining unit. Uygur said the company’s request was ​“reasonable and customary,” but the TYT worker calls the idea of taking anyone out of the proposed union ​“a no go for us.”
The events of this week have only strengthened the resolve of the employees to win a union. ​“If the company is gonna punish us,” the TYT worker said, ​“that just underscores why it’s important for us to organize.”"
demsocialist,"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/31/21043467/google-union-cafeteria-workers-unionized-alphabet-silicon-valley-mountainview
","Around 2,300 cafeteria workers who work at dozens of Google campuses in the Bay Area, including the search giant’s main headquarters in Mountain View, have unionized.
The workers — who include dishwashers and food preparers who serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner for Google employees — voted last month to form a union after a campaign that’s been two years in the making, according to a source involved in the campaign.
Their organizing has gone largely under the radar even amid other high-profile worker activism at Google in the past year, which has included employee protests about sexual harassment, the company’s work with US immigration agencies, and allegations that the company retaliates against employees for reporting HR issues. But the cafeteria workers’ unionization is some of the most significant union activity tech industry workers have accomplished — particularly for service workers who operate as part of Google’s vast “shadow workforce” of contractors who largely receive lower pay and fewer benefits compared to the company’s full-time employees.
The workers who voted to unionize earn wages that start at around $35,000 a year, according to a source familiar with the matter. And they say they don’t receive all the same benefits such as retirement plans that are standard for full-time Google employees. Their move to organize represents a symbolic pushback against the status quo of growing economic inequality in Silicon Valley, where all but the top 10 percent of income earners have seen their wages decline from 1997 to 2017.
The cafeteria workers are organizing with a local chapter of the union Unite Here, which represents some 300,000 workers in the hotel, food service, laundry, warehouse, and casino gaming industries nationally in North America, according to its website.
An arbitrator officially recognized that a majority of the workers at cafeterias across Silicon Valley voted “yes” to union representation on November 20 of this year, according to a union flyer that Recode reviewed. Since Google contracts these on-site food service workers via a third party, they are technically employed by the multinational food service firm Compass Group, which staffs many of Google’s cafeterias through its subsidiary, Bon Appétit Management Company. Compass Group and the union are now in the process of negotiating a contract, according to sources.
“We’re fed up and want change because at one of the richest companies in the world, we’re being overworked and underpaid,” the source involved in the campaign told Recode. “The disrespect from management is just adding insult to injury,” they added, alleging that in organizing meetings, some workers shared stories of being bullied, sometimes subject to “casual racism,” and pressured to work overtime without pay by Compass management.
A representative for Unite Here declined to comment on the union organizing.
“As an organization, Compass Group firmly believes each of our associates has the right to make an informed decision about whether they want to be represented by a third party such as a labor organization,” a spokesperson from Compass Group told Recode in an email. “If they do, Compass Group will meet with the union and engage in good faith bargaining with the goal of achieving a mutually satisfactory agreement as we have done at Google Mountain View.”
With regard to the allegations that management has mistreated employees, a spokesperson wrote that the company is “committed to creating a positive, fair and rewarding work environment, and one in which every Compass Group associate feels empowered to discuss any and all workplace issues.”
A spokesperson from Google shared the following statement: “We have worked with Compass for many years and they’ve done an excellent job operating many of Google’s cafes. We work with lots of partners, many of which have unionized workforces and many of which don’t. We’ll continue to partner with Compass.”
The Google spokesperson also said food service workers employed by Compass at Google’s New York and Seattle area offices have unionized in the last two years with Unite Here.
Service workers in the tech industry, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, have long seen stagnating wages that haven’t kept up with skyrocketing housing prices. In Silicon Valley, where Google’s campuses are located, the cost of living is currently the highest in the entire US, around $2,911 a month for an apartment, according to a recent estimate from the Silicon Valley Institute for Regional Studies.
The situation has become so dire that an ad hoc RV camp formed outside Google’s headquarters, where some tech employees including Google’s own contractors are living. In June, Google announced it would invest $1 billion in land and building homes to help ease the crisis. Facebook and Apple have also made commitments of around $1 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, to address California’s housing crisis that many say has been driven in large part by the growth of major tech companies.
But it could take years before residents see any meaningful results from these efforts, and in the meantime, service and retail workers, along with teachers, firefighters, law enforcement officers, and other non-tech employees, are finding it increasingly difficult to afford to live in their communities.
Previous tech unionization efforts
In recent years, Google and other major tech companies have faced scrutiny for the vast differences in the labor conditions for full-time employees versus contracted workers. At Google, contractors make up around half of the company’s total workforce and are called “TVCs” — temps, vendors, and contractors.
The complaints TVCs have aren’t just about pay, but also working conditions. Many TVCs say they’re bound by forced arbitration agreements, meaning they can’t take their employer to court over workplace issues like sexual harassment. While Google eliminated forced arbitration in its own employment contracts following employee protests, contractors can still be subject to such agreements with the third-party companies that hire them to work at Google.
Some tech contractors have successfully unionized in the past. Back in 2017, around 500 food service workers organized at Facebook’s Menlo Park offices with Unite Here Local 19, the same group currently organizing workers at Google. That union negotiated a five-year contract that included $4.75 per hour in raises, as well as health care coverage and a benefit pension plan.
And thousands of security officers working at hundreds of offices in Silicon Valley, including major tech companies like Facebook, Cisco, and Genentech, unionized with SEIU in 2017. Shuttle drivers who help transport employees of companies like Facebook and Apple have been organizing with the Teamsters in the past several years. And in August, a group of around 80 Google contractors in Pittsburgh voted to unionize, drawing attention to the divide between these workers and their full-time counterparts.
But now, these roughly 2,300 cafeteria workers unionizing at Google’s Silicon Valley campuses represent one of the largest bargaining units of workers at a single major tech company — and a serious demonstration of the strength of a growing labor movement in tech.
Their organizing also comes at a time when Google’s white-collar workforce is increasingly participating in union organizing efforts, despite Google leadership’s attempts to crack down on employee dissent. In October, Google workers held a talk about unionization in Switzerland despite management’s attempts to cancel the meeting, as Recode first reported.
Around a month later, Google employees discovered that the company was meeting with an anti-union consulting firm. And shortly before the Thanksgiving holiday, Google fired four employees who say they were retaliated against for their union organizing. The Communication Workers of America union filed a complaint on behalf of these four in December with the National Labor Relations Board, which has since launched an investigation.
Earlier this month, another former Google employee came forward to say she was fired for her internal organizing efforts. Google denied that it has fired employees for organizing, and said that it terminated the employees for breaching the company’s data security policies.
Some white-collar tech worker activists say unions aren’t necessary to achieve some of the untraditional demands, such as canceling what they view as unethical projects to build technology for warfare and to support US immigrant detention camps. And in the face of apparent recent white-collar organizing suppression by Google’s management, some have doubted the viability of forming a well-organized union.
“I think this is a very symbolic and important push,” said Veena Dubal, a law professor at UC Hastings who studies labor organizing in the tech industry. “The fact that this union was able to organize these very precarious workers, in a large tech company that’s already getting heat for their labor practices with their own employees — it’s such a big deal that it could really push the conversation about tech and labor practices more broadly.”"

If a slim, yellow envelope with a Rye, N.Y., return address lands in your mailbox this holiday season, don’t throw it out. It’s not junk.
Some 1,300 such envelopes have been sent to New Yorkers around the state, containing the good news that R.I.P. Medical Debt, a New York-based nonprofit organization, has purchased their medical debt — and forgiven it.
Last spring, Judith Jones and Carolyn Kenyon, both of Ithaca, N.Y., heard about R.I.P. Medical Debt, which purchases bundles of past-due medical bills and forgives them to help those in need. So the women decided to start a fund-raising campaign of their own to assist people with medical debt in New York.
Over the summer months, the women raised $12,500 and sent it to the debt-forgiveness charity, which then purchased a portfolio of $1.5 million of medical debts on their behalf, for about half a penny on the dollar."

","Bernie Sanders is taking steps to address longstanding political shortcomings that were exposed in 2016, ahead of another possible presidential bid in 2020.
From forging closer ties to the labor movement to shoring up his once-flimsy foreign policy credentials, the moves have provided the senator inroads into party power structures that largely shunned him in favor of Hillary Clinton last year. They've also empowered the progressive icon to harness his newfound political power and help Democrats fight President Donald Trump's administration.
Sanders has been working closely with figures who are close to the party establishment he's long railed against, like American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten. And he's been meeting with international affairs experts such as Bill Perry, a defense secretary in the administration of President Bill Clinton, around a series of speeches designed to define his international vision, one year after running a campaign heavy on domestic policy and light on the rest of the world.
The Vermont independent hasn't decided whether to run for president again in 2020. To his closest allies, his efforts represent a natural next step in his role as ""outreach chairman"" for Senate Democrats, a new position created for him late last year by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.
Yet the maneuvers could form an important part of a Sanders 2020 effort, a dozen of those allies acknowledged to POLITICO — one that looks markedly different from his surprise 2016 bid, which often suffered from a lack of mainstream political support.
""He is now in a very different position than he’s ever been in before. He’s just stepping into the role,” said senior adviser Ari Rabin-Havt, insisting Sanders doesn't see the changes as prep for 2020. “Let’s be clear: He’s in charge of outreach for the caucus. So when people say he’s doing a better job of reaching out? Well, yeah, he’s doing his job. This is a new phase of his career.”

Much of Sanders’ time is now spent fighting Republican plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act and helping organize a constellation of outside liberal groups against GOP tax proposals. But while Sanders himself bristles at questions about 2020, multiple operatives in his political orbit have been gaming out what such a campaign might look.
Constantly reminding themselves and others that the senator is now the country's most popular active elected official, they believe other candidates will have to build their campaigns around him — the unparalleled center of gravity on the left. Their prep now includes game-planning for a handful of other progressives trying to chip into his political lane.
As Sanders monitors his post-2016 political group Our Revolution and the Democratic National Committee's reform efforts, he has also slightly expanded his tight circle of 2016 aides. Campaign manager Jeff Weaver has returned to the senator's political payroll after helping build Our Revolution — which still hosts Sanders' campaign email list and provides him a nationwide foothold.
In contrast to the run-up to 2016, the group of counselors also now includes pollster Ben Tulchin, who joined that year's campaign only after Sanders was convinced that hiring a pollster was worth it. A pair of senior advisers in Sanders' Senate office have also joined. Rabin-Havt, a former Harry Reid aide, has been directing political outreach, and Matt Duss, former president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, is working on foreign policy.
Recognizing the senator’s post-campaign national platform and 99 percent name ID across the country — and aware that his status as a potential 2020 front-runner draws further eyeballs — his team has stopped sticking to just a few pet issues. Now it tries to inject him into as many productive national conversations as possible, sometimes with the support of his wife's new Sanders Institute think tank.
Sanders has often stated his wish to win over other lawmakers to his theory of grass-roots change, and his new Facebook Live show and podcast are largely designed to amplify his voice and grow his audience, in pursuit of that goal.
At times, his team has also tried smoothing over potentially controversial situations that could turn into the kind of political headaches a 2020 hopeful would prefer to avoid, but which would not likely have bothered Sanders four years ago. For example, he ditched a speaking gig at the Detroit Women’s Convention in October after his expected presence ignited a firestorm, instead opting to visit storm damaged areas of Puerto Rico.
To allies on the outer rings of Sanders’ political circles, the flurry of moves looks like the beginnings of a full-fledged political operation, in contrast to last year's relatively bare-bones organization. But it’s a complex balance for someone who hates any perception that he could be an insider.
“Does he do as much politics as we’d like him to? No, but now he’s actually playing the game,” said one of Sanders’ close political advisers. “Before, he’d say he was going to play by his own rules.”
Nonetheless, one year after running an anti-establishment campaign that had the support of just one other senator, Sanders is clearly aiming to improve his standing inside the party. He has worked closely with Schumer and others on defending Obamacare. He has traveled in conjunction with giant liberal advocacy group MoveOn.org to hold health care-focused rallies.
And he has headlined events and conference calls back in Washington with progressive organizations like the Working Families Party.
""I see him taking more responsibility,"" said Weingarten, one of Hillary Clinton's most prominent labor supporters in 2016, who backed Sanders' pick to lead the DNC after that election. The pair have worked together on Puerto Rico recovery efforts and on a community college unionization drive in Vermont, and Weingarten backed Sanders' signature health care proposal this fall.
""That's why you saw so many 'mainstream Democrats' sign on to his Medicare-for-all bill,"" she said.
After resisting advisers’ pleas to give more foreign policy-oriented speeches during his campaign, Sanders has also now been working with Duss to build a public record on international affairs. That work has entailed more than just his trio of major public speeches on the topic this year — a February address to J Street on Trump, Israel and anti-Semitism; a speech on authoritarianism, in June, at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; and a September talk at Missouri’s Westminster College to stress the importance of partnerships “not just between governments, but between peoples.”
He has also been meeting with veteran policymakers — including Perry; former Obama administration National Security Council Middle East official Robert Malley; and Sarah Chayes, a former special adviser to retired Adm. Mike Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff — to discuss foreign developments.
Sanders' moves to bolster his political presence have largely been confined to Washington. He inherited a political infrastructure in the early voting primary states in 2015 after Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren decided not to run. Now, however, he has refrained from dispatching aides to such states, and he has yet to order up polling there.
He has visited Iowa and New Hampshire twice each this year, in addition to other politically important states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia, to talk health care and other policy issues. But his traditional political outreach in early voting states is largely limited to occasional check-ins with local leaders like former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, according to Democrats familiar with the discussions.
Instead, his in-state supporters have maintained their own networks. In New Hampshire, his roughly 75-person steering committee still meets monthly behind closed doors, but the tightly organized group refuses to let local allies know even the location or timing of their meetings, Democrats in the state told POLITICO.
Even to some of Sanders’ biggest cheerleaders, that dynamic reveals an operation that’s revving up but still far from a fully fledged campaign. Yet to the allies dedicated to converting his newfound popularity into results in Washington, it’s significant progress.
After all, the party needs the 13 million voters who enthusiastically backed Sanders last year to show up again in 2018 and 2020, said Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, the DNC deputy chairman and Sanders’ most prominent ally on Capitol Hill.
“Anything that makes Bernie more effective at reaching that movement and continuing to build a powerful progressive base of engaged Americans,"" Ellison said, ""is good for the Democratic Party."""

","In the 1990s, satellite communications were taking off. Demand for space launches was high, but supply of vehicles was low. The U.S. satellite industry was on the prowl for cheap rocket rides into space. The space shuttle was no longer accepting commercial payloads, and there were only so many Delta and Atlas commercial launches to go around. European launches were an option, but they were not cheap, and the U.S. satellite industry wanted to do better. As if in answer to their prayers, the Chinese Communist government stepped up to the plate, offering the industry rides on its Long March rockets for fully half off the going rate.
Strictly speaking, the industry couldn’t take China up on the offer. At least not right away. China was sanctioned by the U.S. government for doing nasty things like proliferating missile technology to other countries. Also inconvenient, these rockets that the U.S. satellite industry was eyeballing were the same ones China was improving for its intercontinental ballistic missiles—some of which were said to be pointed at U.S. cities. But from their perspective, the market savings far outweighed any pesky national-security concerns. And besides, they hadn’t been building political clout for nothing.
Mike Armstrong, CEO of Hughes Electronics, the leading U.S. satellite builder, made gaining access to Chinese launches his mission. He relentlessly lobbied and browbeat Congress and the Clinton administration. He cozied up to Chinese space officials, who were eager to work with him, going so far as to serve as their intermediary in Washington. On their behalf, he told top U.S. government officials that it was “obvious” that “the Chinese are committed not to proliferate missile technology,” despite all indications that this was not true—and which hindsight confirms was not true. Armstrong wasn’t alone. He had a strong ally in Bernard Schwartz, the CEO of satellite maker Loral, who during this time became one of the Democratic Party’s biggest funders. Eventually, the government relented. The satellite industry had its prize: cheap Chinese launches.
Only, as is often the case when things seem too good to be true, Hughes and Loral quickly discovered why the launches were half the price of European ones. The Chinese rockets kept blowing up! Their satellites were destroyed long before they ever made it to space. Chinese officials investigated each failed launch, but couldn’t figure out what had happened, and therefore couldn’t get things right. Hughes and Loral were undeterred. If they could just fix the Chinese rockets, they would experience a windfall …
So they pursued their corporate interests and sent over investigation teams to help China figure out what went wrong. It was a boon for the Chinese rocket program. Not only did the companies show the Chinese Communist government how to fix their rocket design, load analysis, and launch operations; but they also taught China how to properly conduct post-mishap investigations and analysis that could be used for future accidents in perpetuity. It was a match made in economic heaven. The satellite companies saved a bundle of money, and the greatest cost for doing so—China learning how to improve the ICBMs aimed at American cities—didn’t register on their corporate balance sheets at all!

At the same time that Hughes and Loral were boosting their bottom line by reducing American security, China was busy conning another American company out of yet more missile technology by dangling a massive commercial-airliner deal before the executives and shareholders of the nearly bankrupt McDonnell Douglas, who were desperate to stay in business.
The Chinese airliner market was closed to foreign aircraft. The deal would have been an incredible breakthrough. There was just one teensy catch. China first needed McDonnell Douglas to prove it was a serious partner. They made it clear that the only way there would be a deal was if McDonnell Douglas sweetened the pot by selling some of its military aircraft and missile machining equipment to China’s main military purchasing arm.
For McDonnell Douglas, it was a no-brainer. Every corporate incentive pointed to China. Plus, the Chinese Communist Party pinky-swore that the machines wouldn’t be used for military purposes, so there was nothing to worry about. U.S. authorities, desperate to keep McDonnell Douglas in business, agreed to allow the sale under strict conditions. So the company rejected an offer from the plant’s workers in Ohio to buy the machines and keep producing in the U.S., and instead sold and shipped them to China for a song. Once China had the equipment in hand, they violated the U.S. conditions, diverted the machinery directly to a military missile production facility, and killed the deal to buy American airliners. China had its missile equipment, and McDonnell Douglas never sold a single aircraft to China.
This is the story of how, in the midst of a global pandemic, America woke up and realized that it is completely dependent on Chinese manufacturing for everything.
Congress was outraged. How could Hughes, Loral, and McDonnell Douglas all let this happen? From the U.S. point of view, the conclusion was that a few selfish companies took advantage of our political system with bad results. Heads shook in disbelief. Speeches rang out in the halls of Congress. Investigations commenced. All future satellite launches from China were banned. McDonnell Douglas was indicted. Some fines were dished out—significantly less than the companies had stood to gain—but no one went to prison. Prison is for spies, not for profiteers, regardless of the level of tech transfer. Armstrong became chairman and CEO of AT&T and then Comcast. Grim handshakes were made all around. Some damage was done, but the problem was solved.
Except that it wasn’t.
Because this isn’t actually the story of China incentivizing U.S. companies into helping improve their missiles. That’s nothing. This is the story of how, 25 years later, in the midst of a global pandemic, America woke up and realized that it is completely dependent on Chinese manufacturing for everything. Not only for cheap toys and tacky trinkets, but for essential things like medicine, electronics, and military components. The scope of what we are currently incapable of doing is astonishing. According to recent congressional hearings on the impact of tariffs, among other things, we cannot print our own Bibles, manufacture rifle scopes, or even make the special ink to print U.S. dollars without Chinese assistance. It is as embarrassing as it is dangerous.

And it begins in the ’90s when the Chinese government discovered a fresh vulnerability in our economic system. A vulnerability they exploited with Hughes, Loral, and McDonnell Douglas, and that they have been exploiting ever since.
This, in short, is the story of how the Chinese Communist Party hacked America.
The Vulnerability
On March 17, 2020, Geng Shuang, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, speaking on behalf of an authoritarian communist state with a state-run economy, lectured the world on economic freedom. His goal was to preempt the idea of the U.S. decoupling its supply chain from China:
“The global industrial and supply chains are the results of market forces and business decisions,” he said matter-of-factly. “It is unrealistic and insensible to try to sever them.”
These two short sentences from Spokesman Shuang are the essence of the China Hack.
The market is magical. Supply chains are built by trillions of individual economic decisions. They are the result of natural forces. To meddle with such a beautiful natural thing is folly, and can only lead to destruction, says the state that constantly does that very thing to its own benefit.
Since the 1980s, when the Chicago school style of economics really took hold, America has heavily focused its economic structure on one fairly simple principle: the pursuit of self-interest. The philosophy goes something like this: If everyone just looks out for themselves, and government stays out of the way, the so-called invisible hand will take care of the rest, and society will self-organize efficiently and effectively. For corporations, which we view economically as individual actors, the pursuit of self-interest, at least since the shareholder revolution in the ’80s, means maximizing shareholder profit. In fact, according to the theory, it is not just preferred that they maximize shareholder profit, but it is actually their social responsibility to do so in lieu of anything else.
China noticed this aspect of our economic philosophy and, at some point in their dalliance with Western capitalism, the Chinese Communist Party figured out that corporations and individuals, not the government, control nearly everything in America. Natural resources, intellectual property, entertainment, culture, ideas. And when China paired that knowledge with their observation of our intense duty to individual self-interest, the hack was born: Make it profitable for individuals, institutions, organizations, or shareholders, and they will hand the keys of the American castle over to China one piece at a time without thinking twice. In fact, it will be their social responsibility to do so.
The Chinese Communist Party figured out that corporations and individuals, not the government, control nearly everything in America.
It wasn’t a particularly new or innovative idea. Vladimir Lenin saw the opportunity a century ago: “They [capitalists] will furnish credits which will serve us for the support of the Communist Party in their countries and, by supplying us materials and technical equipment which we lack, will restore our military industry necessary for our future attacks against our suppliers. To put it in other words, they will work on the preparation of their own suicide.”
But the Soviets couldn’t take advantage of our fundamental flaw because our predecessors understood the risk and never allowed our systems to integrate. Plus, unlike the Chinese, the Soviets had few products the West wanted; and Cold Warriors recognized the USSR as a prime geopolitical adversary. For a long time, America refused to deal with non-free-market societies.
But as time passed and the Soviet Union collapsed, Nixon made his famous overture to China—and our business sector set their sights on big, juicy, billion-person China, which was a more complex hybrid than the USSR. It had all the right ingredients. Cheap labor. A massive market. Indifference to the environment. And growing competence at manufacturing. American businesses lobbied our policymakers hard for the opportunity to take advantage of those incentives. In pursuit of individual self-interest, we pushed aside China’s human rights record and our tradition of only dealing with countries that bought into our system. If we brought them our trade, so the thought went, our values would follow. This became the U.S. government line as China was welcomed into the WTO with no conditions. Only China didn’t change. Instead, unwittingly, we worked “on the preparation of [our] own suicide.” Because China understood that we would blindly pursue profit over principle, and seduced every sector of business and manufacturing the same way they seduced Hughes, Loral, and McDonnell Douglas.
This isn’t in the past—it is still happening today. The NBA cracking down on a general manager and Blizzard Entertainment banning a professional gamer for supporting Hong Kong protesters. Hollywood studios never criticizing China—and actually working with the Communist Party to modify their films. Apple TV does the same. Tech companies (Apple again), airlines, Marriott, the Gap, all self-censoring and kowtowing to the Chinese regime. Wall Street bankers hiring Chinese Communist Party “princelings” in order to get business and access.
The consolidation of our own markets has created another incentive for companies to work with Chinese companies. Staples and Office Depot, unable to fight Amazon alone on the home front, have turned to a joint venture with China’s version of Amazon, Alibaba, in order to kick-start their e-commerce. Likewise, Verizon has turned to Alibaba for its cloud server in order to circumvent the predation at home.
It’s a uniquely modern American mentality that places all other principles behind the greatest principle of all: the pursuit of self-interest. Exxon CEO Lee Raymond summarized the attitude best: “I’m not a U.S. company and I don’t make decisions based on what’s good for the U.S.”
Exploiting that philosophy, along with our focus on deregulation and a trust in the magic of the market, is the foundation of how China took control of our entire supply chain, numerous industries, and know-how that America, as a society, paid for and developed, and even a huge slice of “materials and technologies deemed strategic and critical to U.S. national security,” as outlined in a recent national-security report.

The Exploit
A common talking point on Chinese tech transfer is that China “steals” our tech. But outright theft is a minor part of the story, and if we focus on theft we miss the more fundamental dynamics of how U.S. industry serves as Beijing’s enabler. It’s true, China does commit outright blatant theft, but often even the theft wouldn’t be possible without the access China acquires by taking advantage of our corporate pursuit of narrow self-interest.
So while theft is one of a variety of tricks China employs to acquire our technology, the primary mechanism behind the transfer is hacking our dedication to self-interest. There are easy-to-find examples in every realm of tech transfer: education, employment, production, and investment.
In education, China places full-paying students, often members of the People’s Liberation Army, at Western universities. Likewise, non-military Chinese students come here and pay full tuition. These students conduct research at our universities, often targeting emerging tech with military implications, and then they take what they’ve learned back to the Chinese regime. This represents a massive transfer of technical expertise. According to a DIUx report on tech transfer, approximately 25 percent of U.S. STEM graduate students are Chinese nationals, and most Chinese students now return to China after they graduate.
It’s easy to demonize the universities, and public officials have attempted to stem this transfer by appealing to national pride through a persuasion campaign led by the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy to ask the universities to be more vigilant. But these appeals will ultimately fail because vigilance is not the only problem. Our universities, like our corporations, must operate by the golden rule of our system, the pursuit of their own self-interests, or they will fail. Higher education is a competitive world, fueled by dollars and discoveries. Our legislatures have defunded higher education for years, and the universities need the full-paying tuition, the STEM students, and the research money that America isn’t providing them. So they get them from China. Which allows China to exploit our institutions and federal research funding to leapfrog us in key technologies like quantum computing.
The Senate Subcommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs recently completed a report on this exploit, exposing how “American taxpayer funded research has contributed to China’s global rise over the last 20 years.”
The biggest payoff of the China Hack is how it has allowed China to enter or capture our industries at the lowest possible point on the cost curve.
Just as universities are short on STEM students, U.S. businesses and other institutions are short on tech talent and need Chinese tech workers to fill their ranks. This opens them up to greater espionage risk and the transfer of technology through workers. The Senate report mentioned above examined China’s Thousand Talents Program, which recruited over 7,000 researchers and scientists between 2008 and 2017 to sign binding contracts with the Chinese government. These contracts did things like give the regime intellectual-property rights in work conducted by the employee in the U.S., require the participant to replicate research they did for their U.S. employer when they returned to China, and require them to train or recruit Chinese government–approved students to work for them in the United States. U.S. companies and institutions are not unaware of the risks, but they need workers to pursue their own self-interests, so they hire them.
For years, China tempted U.S. businesses with cheap labor. In a well-known story, the business world, following their duty to maximize profit, shipped millions of jobs to China. Along with those jobs, they sent highly qualified experts to China to set up the industries, infrastructure, transportation, machining, organization, and all elements of light industry and advanced manufacturing. The investment was deep, complete, and fully in the interest of these companies. “It’s taken us 30 years to build our production base in China,” said toy maker CEO Jay Foreman when summing up why his company, like 87 percent of those surveyed by the US-China Business Council, was not leaving China despite tariffs. It is not just jobs that are lost when these facilities move overseas. Manufacturing is not static—it evolves constantly. Thirty years of building out production bases in China includes 30 years of manufacturing innovations, improvements, and expertise that have been captured by Chinese manufacturers and lost to America.
Along the same lines, when these businesses weren’t building up China’s production base, they were transferring their intellectual property to China through things like forced joint ventures with Chinese firms or oppressive Chinese disclosure requirements for product approvals. Thus, alongside a deep investment of corporate time and money in China has come a massive transfer of technological know-how and expertise that has left us reliant on Chinese manufacturing for everything from solar panels to missile components. All in the name of corporate self-interest.
Until the incentives are changed, the transfer is not going to stop. There is just too much for these businesses to gain. China learned this early on, from Hughes and Loral. Industry’s response to the congressional report finding that the companies damaged national security was to double down on prioritizing their own self-interest over national security. “If the report takes steps to take [export laws] back to times like the Cold War, that’s a mistake,” said Mark Rosenker, spokesman for the Electronic Industries Alliance, a trade group.
To corrupt a phrase from Dr. Seuss, “Business is business and business must grow, regardless of national security, you know.”
China understands how our pursuit of self-interest works and, rather than treat it as some mystical force that cannot be influenced but only admired, like we do, they harness it to their own ends.
The Fallout
The obvious spoils of the hack for China are immense. A country they consider a direct competitor and adversary is reliant on their production for almost everything, including components and materials for almost every military end item. They are inoculated from the world’s greatest propaganda machine, Hollywood. And they can now make pretty much anything they want as well or better than anyone else in the world.
But the biggest benefit of the hack to the Chinese government is the massive transfer of invisible wealth it represents.
To understand this transfer, it is important to look at the life cycle of an industry and what it costs a society to create an industry or product at any given point in time. The societal cost to be a first mover, and initially create an industry or product, is quite high. The resources of the entire country go into it: education system, infrastructure, energy, protecting or exploiting the environment, limited physical resources, time, policy, subsidies, other opportunities, and legacy discoveries—which are products or technology that cost resources in the past, like the internet, GPS, and touch screens, and that become the foundation for new tech and research and development.
As an industry or product matures beyond the initial stages or prototypes and enters early generations, the cost to enter the industry often goes down. In competitive market economics, entering here is sometimes called a second-mover advantage.
Then, as advantages get worked out and winners take control, production, the market, and the expertise consolidate. This is particularly true in the U.S., where the financial industry strongly prefers, rewards, and reinforces monopoly positions. Often, the technology becomes more advanced and inaccessible. Entering a post-consolidation market at this point is extremely costly and even prohibitive depending on the degree of consolidation and things like rent structure, intellectual-property regimes, trade structure, or regulatory capture.
A society that controls an industry at this point becomes a monopolist, creates the rules and standards for the industry, and creates dependencies in all other countries that want the product. A good current example of this is Huawei’s comparative advantage in parts of 5G telecom hardware production. A 2018 assessment of the defense industrial base and supply chain describes the impact of this consolidation in defense: “China is also the sole source or a primary supplier for a number of critical energetic materials used in munitions and missiles. In many cases, there is no other source or drop-in replacement material and even in cases where that option exists, the time and cost to test and qualify the new material can be prohibitive—especially for larger systems (hundreds of millions of dollars each).”
The United States has long been a first-mover country technologically, which takes a lot of societal resources. This can be a great thing. New industries and products are exciting; they improve our lives; they keep our economy humming; and they keep us at the cutting edge of the world economy, academia, and defense. But it’s resource-intensive, and the cost is forever locked in. We paid what we paid to get in.
× Expand Andy Wong/AP Photo Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang listens to a question during a daily briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs office, March 18, 2020, in Beijing.
The biggest payoff of the China Hack is how it has allowed China to enter or capture our industries at the lowest possible point on the cost curve. We pour resources into creating these industries; China then purchases or lures production and expertise to its mainland, learns the business, either captures the foreign businesses or gradually replaces them with domestic ones, and waits for or subsidizes the consolidation of the market.
As a country, the U.S. doesn’t pay attention or do anything until the industry is long gone and there is a crisis. Rare earths, telecommunications equipment like 5G, and pharmaceuticals are great examples of industries we created, shed, and, only during crisis, realized we needed to get back into. At that point, getting back in means re-entering a consolidated market, where the cost is huge. Even in industries where China doesn’t get our stuff on the cheap and muscles in with state-backed power, like solar panels or small consumer drones, we end up in the same position: staring down a cost-prohibitive re-entry into the market. The result of all of this is that the U.S. is doing the least efficient thing possible: buying high, selling low, and trying to buy high again!
How does a national economic system based on individual economic efficiencies result in such an inefficient result for the U.S. as a nation? The answer, and the brilliance of China’s strategy, is that societal cost and risk are not included in the calculus of the people making the individual business decisions of these industries.
China looks at business transactions at the nation-state level, and the decisions are guided by national interests and decision-makers. But in the U.S., these decisions are based upon the individual self-interests of founders, boards of directors, investors, families, or other groups of individuals.
When these individuals look at risk, it’s not their job or in their self-interest to consider national risk. Whether it is national security, espionage, supply chain fragility or dependencies, or something else, the cost of this type of risk is completely invisible to them. The only risk that appears on their balance sheets is the risk to their own profits.
How does a national economic system based on individual economic efficiencies result in such an inefficient result for the U.S. as a nation?
In the case of moving to China or accessing the Chinese market, it’s been an easy decision. The profit companies make by engaging in China far outweighs the loss of IP to a joint-venture partner or to the Chinese government. Dan Harris, a Seattle-based attorney advising businesses eyeing Chinese markets noted this in a CNN Money article: “The thing is that the foreign companies that give up their technology usually do so at least somewhat of their own volition. Yes, maybe they need to do so to get into China, but they also have the choice not to go into China, right?”
Selling out to China is probably an even easier decision. The cost of a company to its U.S. owners only includes their own inputs, and doesn’t reflect all the societal inputs that went into the company. For China, however, the value of the company is much greater than what U.S. owners think it’s worth, because it offers a technological shortcut and/or a path to a monopoly position. Because of this baked-in value that is invisible to the owners, they sell for both a personal profit and a societal loss.
The rare-earth magnet industry epitomizes this type of loss. The U.S. government, through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), partnered with private industry to develop the magnet technology. Once the technology was developed, the original partner decided to sell the magnet developments and move on to the next thing.
This wouldn’t have been a big deal if the industry had stayed in U.S. hands. The federal investment was made to create the industry in the U.S., and the industry would have been here. In this case, however, China stepped into the buying chain. A U.S. hedge fund, Sextant Group, partnered with the sons-in-law of the Chinese premier, bought the industry, and moved the whole thing to China, leaving the U.S. completely dependent on China for an industry it funded and developed and a technology that goes into almost every smart weapon, aircraft, and communication item in the U.S. military.
The sale was a coup for China, a disaster for U.S. society, bad for the U.S. workers in Indiana who lost their jobs, and a big win for the private businesses and hedge fund that converted the unaccounted societal inputs, national-security risk, and supply chain risk into profit by selling to China.
Every time this happens, China gains an incremental advantage in its competition with the U.S., and the U.S. gains another supply chain dependency on China. Or, in the case of something like the sale of AMC Theatres, a restriction on freedom of expression.
The Foundation of Change
This can all be changed. We choose our economic system and its attributes. And if the time were ever right to create a “security patch” to protect our programming from the China Hack, it’s now, while COVID has policymakers focused on it. But it’s going to take three distinct changes in mindset, which add up to more than a patch.
The first is abandoning the religion of market mysticism. Market mysticism is the idea that “the market,” short for basically the sum of all commercial interactions, is a sacred, natural, and untouchable force. The idea espoused, disingenuously, by the Chinese Communist spokesman that humankind can never govern the market, because it is already perfectly ruled by magical laws like self-interest. On the contrary, the Chinese Communist Party has proved brilliant at governing the market in China’s national interest.
I recently had a conversation about Department of Defense supply chains with a retired admiral who once led a prestigious U.S. combatant command. The admiral vociferously complained about consolidation of the defense marketplace, but shrugged his shoulders when I asked him what the best approach to fixing it would be. If only the market had not dealt us such a poor hand, he lamented.
When I suggested the immense market power the Department of Defense could bring to bear on the situation, particularly through the concerted effort of the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment and the deputy assistant secretary of defense for industrial policy, he was taken aback. It was as if I had suggested that we water the crops by asking the clouds for some rain. Foolish and impossible.
This mindset is pervasive, and it is wrong. Alan Greenspan, once a true believer and pontiff of this religion, began to recognize it in 2008, when he testified about the flaw in his economic ideology before Congress—as the result of that ideology savaging our economy.
This can all be changed. We choose our economic system and its attributes.
The market is not magic. It is a social tool consisting of a set of interactions governed by rules, policies, and traditions. It can be manipulated, modified, and managed in an infinite number of ways. It is the programming, and we are the hardware. We code it with our laws the same way a coder writes script. China knows it, they have hacked it, and until we recognize the reality and apply some new code, we will be vulnerable and exploitable.
The second change in mindset we need to make is to acknowledge that industries, corporations, intellectual property, and universities are national assets created by national policies and resources, and that they actually can be answerable to the society that incubates them.
Like market mysticism, there is a pervasive idea baked into our system that new technologies, services, or devices spring out of American garages and minds through sheer force of will. This could not be further from the truth. This is not to diminish the accomplishments of individual Americans, but to recognize the society we have built and implore policymakers to tweak it so that we can save it.
American innovation is not the result of the U.S. having the world’s coolest garages or a monopoly on genius. U.S. innovation has always been fostered on a foundation of law, tax code, rights, regulations, freedoms, attitude, security, education, infrastructure, energy, and numerous other things. These social and economic aspects and policies—our coding—govern the results. And when the results are diminished or become compromised, we need to modify them to meet the challenge. Many of the great inventions and products we love and enjoy today are the product of direct market interventions. Sometimes through carrots like government funding and incentives, and sometimes through sticks like antitrust actions that crushed monopolies and allowed new businesses and innovations to sprout from garages and flourish.
The third and arguably most important change in mindset is that our political leaders, policymakers, and thinkers must embrace the courage to lead. Market mysticism is easy. Believing in it means that you are never at fault, it’s just the market! It relieves leaders of all responsibility for what happens. Abdicating responsibility, though, is how we lose. It’s how China takes control of our crown jewels and then blows right past us. The threat is not the future. It is now. In 2019, China became the first country in history to surpass the United States in annual international patents. That same year, it also passed the U.S. in artificial-intelligence patents.
The goal of these mindset shifts—rejecting market mysticism, embracing society’s role in governing the economy, and developing the courage to lead—is not to reject our current system. The goal is to strengthen and revitalize a system that has begun to decay. We must adopt an industrial policy that modifies our economic coding to better harness the power of free markets and fix vulnerabilities like the China Hack.
The Fix(es!)
There are a lot of industrial-policy tools at the policymakers’ disposal for addressing the China Hack, and they should be mixed and matched and experimented with for the best result. The key is always to keep in mind that if a given policy does not modify the incentive structure that allows for the China Hack, it is unlikely to succeed. Therefore, fixes need to embrace one or more of the below strategies.
1. Raise the private cost of offshoring or selling out to China to reflect the true cost of the assets being sold or offshored.
The goal here is to transfer external costs like the national-security cost of Loral and Hughes improving Chinese rockets, or Sextant Group teaming with China to sell our rare-earth industry overseas, from our national ledger onto the companies’ balance sheets. We could do this by closing loopholes that allow them to convert national risk into private profit or transfer the fruits of national resources like basic research, infrastructure, or education to adversaries like China for private profit.
This goal could also be achieved by artificially increasing the cost of selling to China, or another entity hostile to our system, through a targeted tax or penalty scheme. For instance, a product or technology created substantially thanks to publicly subsidized R&D would have to reimburse the government for the cost if the company sold to China. Or the U.S. government or perhaps a public trust could have something like “dormant” shares in corporations that are subsidized by public funds. These shares would vest whenever a company attempts to move or sell overseas, and the company would have to buy them out before moving or selling. Ideas like these would keep the private cost low for regular transactions but raise it in the China context.
Further, strict penalties for bad actors like Hughes, Loral, and McDonnell Douglas must be applied and enforced. When the likely punishment for a bad act is a fine of an amount less than a company stands to gain from a bad act, the incentive arrows all point toward risking the bad act. Likewise, when an executive who makes the decision to behave badly is rewarded by industry, like Mike Armstrong, there is no incentive to avoid the bad act.
2. Lower the initial cost of entry into an industry for U.S. producers.
We can lower costs by coming in as a second mover on some targeted technology. China has even shown us how: Stealing tech, adopting market inducements for manufacturing here, and other reciprocal measures against China should be on the table. Small drones and quantum computing are areas where some of these techniques could be useful. The Chinese drone maker DJI has numerous joint ventures with U.S. companies. We could explore using some of the same tech transfer techniques for Chinese joint ventures here that China uses against us there. Likewise, we could explore options to letting Chinese 5G technology into the U.S.—but only under a forced joint venture or tech transfer structure similar to the Chinese model.
In the U.S., a vast amount of data is owned and controlled by just a couple of companies. It is similar to early in the Cold War, when Bell Labs was sitting on a vast array of non-communications patents, many of which they had developed during World War II projects with, for, or funded by the U.S. government. An antitrust case against Bell Labs led to a consent decree opening up its storied patent vaults. This created an explosion of innovation across a broad array of sectors, leading to Texas Instruments, the U.S. semiconductor industry, and really the beginning of Silicon Valley as we know it. The transistor, the solar cell, and the laser, for example, were all freed for development.
Opening up monopoly-controlled data vaults, as FCC Chair Tom Wheeler suggests, could eliminate a significant barrier to new industries and firms in the U.S.
3. Lower the cost of re-entry into an industry for the U.S. producers.
As discussed, one of the worst outcomes of the China Hack is that we are buying industries high, selling them low, and then trying to get back in when the cost is high again because the industry has been consolidated. If an industry is not consolidated, it cannot be wholly offshored and the barriers to re-entry are much lower.
Strategies for preventing abusive consolidation include antitrust and antimonopoly actions, creating equitable access to capital, modifying the current tilt in patent and intellectual-property law, and a more expansive role for the Federal Reserve.
During COVID, the Fed has pumped money into the economy by buying corporate bonds from companies like Amazon, Apple, Boeing, Comcast, CVS, Ford, IBM, Oracle, Walmart, and others. The list is long and includes both investment-grade and junk bonds—including junk bonds issued by fossil fuel companies.
These investments could be made with a much more strategic purpose. Congress could create a special-purpose vehicle between the Fed and another agency to target key industries that the U.S. needs to get back into. Or the federal government could back loans in targeted industries that China has captured, such as solar manufacturing, as it does with federally backed mortgages. The Federal Reserve could then purchase those loans.
Utilizing the Fed doesn’t require raising taxes, because it creates or supports assets that the Fed either sells backs or allows to mature. If these strategic investments are made as the Fed’s current nonstrategic assets mature or are sold and the money is returned to the Fed, it won’t even add to their balance sheet.
4. Pay the price to get back in now, because it will only go up.
The cost of getting back into the industries we have lost is likely to only go up as advancements in manufacturing and procedures continue to be made overseas and our skills continue to atrophy. This is going to require courageous leaders in key government positions: Treasury, the Federal Reserve, Commerce, Energy, the U.S. Trade Representative, the Pentagon’s Industrial Policy office, and others. Tools such as special-purpose vehicles, the Defense Production Act, and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are all available, but without courageous leaders, attempts to change will be overcome by the financial industry and investors, who have a strong incentive in maintaining the status quo.
Industries that America created and has since lost that are critical for the future should be targeted and reshored. Printed circuit board, semiconductor, telecommunications, and solar manufacturing are key industries that the U.S. has divested and needs to regain before the growing overseas expertise makes it impossible. The cost of getting back into these industries goes up by the day, so it is imperative that we move quickly. The good news is that bringing industries like these back home has numerous spillover effects, such as good jobs, clean energy, and expanded technical expertise, not to mention eliminating the hidden costs of risky supply chains and dependence on adversarial manufacturing.
5. Create barriers to theft, education placement, marketplace participation, and investment.
This is probably the most talked-about strategy and includes things like tariffs, immigration restrictions, and even trade wars. These measures should always be on the table, but with the understanding that while these tools may have the ability to prevent wealth from leaving the U.S., they do not bring it here or create more here.
6. Recruit and welcome immigrants.
We may not have a monopoly on genius, but we can attract it here and keep it here. Attracting immigrants educated elsewhere transfers wealth into the U.S. and lowers the education cost to our country of creating a new industry. Some of America’s greatest innovations have famously been created by immigrants. Attracting wealth and lowering costs like this should be a bipartisan issue.
With regard to all those Chinese students and workers here, rather than educating and training them for their return to China, encouraging more to stay would be a huge transfer of wealth to us from a direct competitor.
All of this is not just an economic battle. It is a competition to preserve a democratic way of life against an authoritarian regime that wants to spread its idea of Big Brother “1984” governance around the globe. Winning will require taking a hard look at our incentive structure and reprogramming our economy. Although China is gaining ground, it is not too late to reverse the trend. We simply need the courage and creativity to do so."

","Eight members of Congress, including prominent progressive Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib, are backing the program. A handful of likely incoming House freshmen, along with the Service Employees International Union, Electoral Justice Project of the Movement for Black Lives and climate advocacy group Sunrise Movement, are also on board.
""There is no doubt we need to evict Donald Trump and immediately begin the work of repairing and rebuilding stronger,” said Pressley. “Our country is facing overlapping crises of public health, economic inequality and systemic racism. The People's Charter offers a pathway to work together toward healing and justice for everyone.”
Biden supports some of the planks of the proposal, such as free Covid-19 testing and a ban on evictions and foreclosures during the pandemic. But he has already come out against other items, such as implementing single-payer health care and reducing police funding.
“It’s putting a stake in the ground that we believe Joe Biden can become a New Deal 2.0 president,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), another member of Congress who has signed onto the plan. “He has talked about the crisis that Roosevelt faced. He has talked about wanting to have a new New Deal for the 21st century. That should be the direction he goes instead of the incrementalism of the ’90s.”
Philadelphia City Councilwoman Kendra Brooks, one of several local and state officials who are supporting the plan, added that “it’s something that gives voters some enthusiasm.”
Maurice “Moe” Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party, said the organization will promote the agenda as part of its campaign to persuade progressive voters to cast a ballot for Biden.
“We endorsed Elizabeth Warren and then we endorsed Bernie Sanders, so it’s not surprising that our party and our base have some policy differences with Joe Biden,” said Mitchell. “People, in order to be enthusiastic about voting, need to vote for something — and the People’s Charter provides folks with something that is outside of candidates’ politics to vote for. It also sets up conditions postelection to articulate that this election was a referendum on this agenda.”"

","Read: White nationalism’s deep American roots
On June 2, amid the nationwide demonstrations to protest the killing of George Floyd, officers in Philadelphia allowed men armed with bats to linger outside a police station past curfew, then looked on while members of the group beat protesters. Around the same time, authorities in Curry County, Oregon, seemed to welcome “local boys” defending the community against a rumored appearance from the left-wing group antifa. A constable in Texas called on members of a far-right paramilitary organization called Oath Keepers to guard a hair salon from threats of looting and arson. A police officer in Salem, Oregon, was filmed politely asking a group of armed men to disperse ahead of curfew “so we don't look like we're playing favorites.”
But deferential treatment of armed counterprotesters suggests that police are playing favorites. When law enforcement reacts leniently to far-right militant organizations, those groups tend to believe any violence on their part is authorized, says Michael German, a retired FBI agent who spent months in the early 1990s working undercover among white supremacists and right-wing militants. Consistent leniency, he told me, “has created a monster that’s going to be hard to contain.”
This week’s violence suggests that “you’re going to see more people arming themselves and deciding they’re going to police the environment,” Erroll Southers, the director of Homegrown Violent Extremism Studies at the University of Southern California’s Price School of Public Policy, told me.
Vigilantes have recently appeared in situations beyond anti-police-violence protests too. Authorities have allowed men and women wielding assault rifles to storm state capitol buildings in protest of the mask mandates and stay-at-home orders instituted during the coronavirus pandemic. Armed militias, under the watch of police, have demonstrated against the removal of Confederate statues. (Left-wing groups have used intimidation tactics and violence too, but their relationship to law enforcement is different and their presence has been much less frequent at public events this year.)
President Donald Trump and his allies have not condemned armed vigilantism. ""How shocked are we that 17-year-olds with rifles decided they had to maintain order when no one else would?"" Tucker Carlson asked on his Fox News program. At the Republican National Convention last night, Vice President Mike Pence decried the “rioting and looting” occurring in America’s cities and vowed to stand up for law enforcement. But he didn’t reference Rittenhouse, or the police shooting of Jacob Blake that triggered the Kenosha protests in the first place. When he denounced the murder of federal officer Dave Patrick Underwood in Oakland in May, Pence failed to mention that he was murdered by a man with ties to a far-right extremist group; instead, Pence implied that the officer’s death was caused by “the riots.” Trump similarly omitted details about the Kenosha protests when he announced yesterday that he planned to send federal law enforcement and the National Guard to Wisconsin “to restore law and order.” Over the summer, Trump has repeatedly referred to Black Lives Matter protesters as “thugs,” and in June ordered peaceful demonstrators to be tear-gassed and shot with rubber bullets."

","Let’s try to figure out the position of one of America’s biggest unions—the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), chiefly a union of supermarket employees—on police reform.
In early June, the union’s massive Los Angeles chapter, Local 770, joined a group of other unions and community groups to urge Mayor Eric Garcetti to reduce funding for the Los Angeles Police Department by $250 million, and redirect those funds to increased social services in minority communities. Local 770 has generally been a union with progressive, but not radical, politics, and there’s no doubt that many of its predominantly Latino and African American members’ interactions with the LAPD informed the union’s position.
In part because Local 770’s stance could be taken as a bellwether of the emerging Democratic consensus to diminish the police’s capacity for abuse, Garcetti did indeed direct an additional $250 million to social services, funding those programs by reducing the police budget $150 million and cutting other spending as well. The city’s police union responded by questioning Garcetti’s sanity and health.
More from Harold Meyerson
But even as UFCW Local 770 was all for curtailing the cops, across the country in Maryland, Local 1994—comprised chiefly of civil servants along with a small number of deputy sheriffs—fired one of its staffers for promoting police reform. In 2016, Local 1994 had hired Gabriel Acevero, a Black Lives Matter activist, as an organizer. Two years later, Acevero was elected to Maryland’s House of Delegates, a part-time position which therefore requires its nonwealthy members to keep their day jobs. Acevero kept his with the local, even as he introduced bills in the legislature that would repeal statutes that made it difficult to discipline or discharge police for violent misconduct.
When a local police union (not part of the UFCW) complained to 1994’s president, former deputy sheriff Gino Renne, about Acevero’s attacks on what amounted to its members’ immunity from discipline, Renne convened a meeting, which concluded with Acevero being fired.
So how do we describe the UFCW’s position on police reform? Contradictory? Incoherent? Self-negating?
If we consult the international’s website, we find a brief statement from UFCW President Mark Perrone in response to George Floyd’s murder, which doesn’t address anything about the police. “Now more than ever,” Perrone writes, “we must stand together to end the hate and discrimination that is poisoning this nation, and to make clear that we all stand in support of peaceful protests and in opposition to violence of any kind.” If we’re trying to discern a coherent UFCW position on policing, this provides no guidance.
The UFCW, I hasten to point out, is a union well within the generally liberal mainstream of American labor, and its positions on the police are by no means exceptional. The reason is relatively straightforward. A number of the nation’s leading unions—and in particular, the nation’s most progressive leading unions—contain locals of prison guards or police.
While it’s rare to find an individual local like 1994, a local that represents a smattering of sheriffs alongside offices full of non-police government employees, it takes no special effort to find cop and guard locals affiliated with national unions. You’ll find them in AFSCME, which represents all manner of public employees; in SEIU, which represents health care, home and child care, janitorial, and public-sector workers; in the Teamsters; in the Communications Workers; and in a host of other major unions. Cop and guard locals do not comprise more than 7 or 8 percent of these unions’ members, but they are proving to be impediments to American labor’s ability to advance the cause of police reform.

THOSE LOCALS are there in part because, over the past 40 years, as employers have succeeded in almost totally shutting down private-sector organizing, organizing cops has been a comparative breeze. Their employers—local and state governments under both Democrats and Republicans—were not about to stand in the way of police if they wanted to join a union. As many as 80 percent of the nation’s police are unionized, a rate far higher than that of any other sizable occupation.
This has plunged a number of our most powerful unions into a fine mess. Many of them are heavily Black or Latino, and some of them have been among the leading and most powerful advocates for social-justice campaigns. AFSCME has been joined at the hip with the civil rights movement even before its historic campaign to unionize the (all-Black) sanitation workers of Memphis in 1968. SEIU has been perhaps the leading funder of the immigrant rights movement over the past three decades. In election seasons, no one has devoted more resources to turning out the Black vote than AFSCME, or to turning out the Latino vote than SEIU. And at a time when the broad liberal community, of which AFSCME and SEIU are pillars, has come to see policing as a major instrument of white supremacy and minority suppression, and when a majority of the members of unions like AFSCME and SEIU share that assessment (in too many cases, based on their personal experiences), you’d expect institutions like AFSCME, SEIU, and the AFL-CIO to be leading the charge to rein in the cops.
Except, as currently constituted, they can’t.
Cop and guard locals do not comprise more than 7 or 8 percent of these unions’ members, but they are proving to be impediments to American labor’s ability to advance the cause of police reform.
To be sure, they support much of the police reform agenda; just not all of it. When the House passed its police reform bill in late June with unanimous Democratic support, AFL-CIO President Rich Trumka gave the bill a half-throated endorsement. “While not perfect,” Trumka wrote, “the Justice in Policing Act includes concrete, commonsense actions like banning chokeholds, expanding the use of body cameras, ending racial profiling and demilitarizing police departments. Today, the House took an important step forward in creating a fairer, more community-centric policing culture.”
What wasn’t perfect? One important feature of the bill that Trumka chose not to put on his list of commendable “commonsense actions” was the bill’s reeling in of “qualified immunity,” a court-created doctrine that has made it impossible for victims of police violence to sue abusive police officers for damages.
On the one hand, Trumka’s reticence reflects a general fear in labor that making police officers personally liable could open the floodgates for suits against all public employees, just as attacking the police’s right to collective bargaining could encourage anti-union forces to attack all public employees’ right to bargain collectively (as, indeed, anti-union forces already have).
On the other hand, his stance also reflects the dilemma of organizations constrained by their own duty to represent their members. While there has been substantial progressive criticism of the AFL-CIO for having a police union, the International Union of Police Associations (IUPA), in its ranks, that’s not really what is holding back an otherwise progressive federation. IUPA is just one of the 55 unions that make up the AFL-CIO; its 100,000 members constitute roughly 1 percent of the total Federation membership. Unions like AFSCME, a Federation powerhouse whose police and prison guard unions make up about 7 percent of its overall membership, present more of an obstacle.

In a sense, the problem now confronting AFSCME, SEIU, the AFL-CIO, and the rest of mainstream labor is that the experience of police unions—theirs and others’—has validated organized labor’s fundamental premise: Collective bargaining by workers with clout really works. While nothing about police or prison guard work is easy, it certainly pays a lot better, and offers much more generous benefits, due to union successes. Those same union successes, however, have also managed to shield cops and guards from the consequences of their actions, which in turn has had dire consequences for those unions’ African American members.
A 2017 report by Reuters of police contracts in more than 80 cities found that the overwhelming majority of those contracts ensured that officers’ disciplinary records would be erased. Roughly half the contracts also enabled officers to see the evidence against them before being subjected to questioning. The following year, a University of Oxford study of America’s 100 largest cities found a high correlation between the scope of officer immunity established in union contracts and the level of police violence and abuse.
In short, bargaining for cops doesn’t lead to the kind of win-win situation that bargaining for other workers largely produces. That doesn’t mean that cops shouldn’t have the right to collectively bargain. All workers need that right, and when some police practices result in police abuse, the solution shouldn’t be to outlaw police bargaining, but to outlaw those particular practices.
Rather than see their affiliation with police locals as an obstacle to their ability to fully represent the interests of their Black members, however, a number of these unions argue that they’re working with those locals to establish, upgrade, or maintain “codes of excellence” in responsible, color-blind policing. But the data we have on who police officers actually are, on what they believe and feel, strongly suggests that such codes won’t mean much by the time they trickle down to the streets.
A 2017 PEW survey of police reveals a workforce—most especially, the white segment of that workforce—with what we might term a Trumpian worldview. Pew found that 92 percent of white officers said that America had made the changes that assured equal rights for Blacks, a view shared by just 29 percent of Black officers and a distinct minority of the public at large. Just 27 percent of white officers believed that protests that followed police killings of African Americans were at least partly motivated by a sincere desire to make policing more accountable (69 percent of Black cops believed they were).
White male police officers also revealed clear behavioral differences from their Black and female co-workers. According to Pew:
A third of all officers say that in the past month, they have physically struggled or fought with a suspect who was resisting arrest. Male officers are more likely than their female counterparts to report having had this type of encounter in the past month—35% of men vs. 22% of women. And white officers (36%) are more likely than black officers (20%) to say they have struggled or fought with a suspect in the past month. Among Hispanic officers, 33% say they had an encounter like this.
It’s the worldview of white male police that infuses the perspectives of most police unions, which may be as much a story of racial bias in advancement into leadership positions as anything. When the AFL-CIO released its statement in the wake of the George Floyd killing—which made clear it supported some reforms but had no plans to expel or otherwise part company with IUPA—Sam Cabral, president of IUPA, sent an indignant response to Trumka. “Your recent statement,” he began,
where you speak of “America’s long history of racism and violence against Black people” is inflammatory and patently false. Further your call to end racial profiling and “demilitarize” police forces makes assumptions that are, again, ridiculous. Racial profiling is already banned in every police agency I am aware of. If by “militarization” you are referring to our members having military surplus armored vehicles and other equipment, you should first have, at least, gained a passing knowledge of when and why those vehicles and equipment are deployed. In short, they save both law enforcement and civilian lives.
The most revelatory sentence in Cabral’s response is the first. Nothing in the AFL-CIO’s resolution required him to label “America’s long history of racism and violence against Black people” as “inflammatory and patently false.” That’s simply an expression of IUPA’s Trumpian worldview. (Not surprisingly, IUPA endorsed Trump for re-election late last year, though until the Floyd murder, IUPA had flown so far beneath the AFL-CIO’s radar that hardly anyone there even knew of the endorsement.)
What Cabral (and white cops generally) believe comes as no surprise to the leaders of America’s unions. As I noted in a previous piece on police unions, Jerry Wurf, AFSCME’s president from 1964 through 1981, once referred to the members of an AFSCME prison guard local as “the kind of people who elected Hitler.” Moreover, the predominant white male working-class segment of police forces also hails from the segment of the American people that has most moved rightward, or at least Trumpward, in recent years. Some doubtless view themselves as the point of the Trumpian spear.
There was an institutional logic, as well as genuine belief, behind IUPA’s endorsement and Cabral’s letter. Only about 20 percent of the nation’s unionized police are part of the AFL-CIO, its member unions, or other nonexclusively police unions that don’t belong to the AFL-CIO, like SEIU and the Teamsters. The vast majority of cops belong to unions, like the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), that are exclusively of, by, and for police officers, and that frequently market themselves to cops as tougher, more confrontational, more macho, and more Trumpian than IUPA or the presumably wussy cop locals embedded in anti-Trump unions like AFSCME. This leads to a kind of Gresham’s law among police unions; to avoid being out-machoed and out-Trumped, even the presumably wussy locals have to simultaneously sound tough and enforce omertà when their members are accused of abuse. If they don’t, their members may well decertify them and hook up with the FOP.
This institutional logic, abetted by Trumpian beliefs, makes it highly unlikely that police unions will take the sage advice of Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. Facing a barrage of criticism over the years-long purgatory in which some New York teachers accused of misconduct inhabited, on full salary but forbidden to teach, AFT agreed to an accelerated process. Weingarten has suggested that police unions similarly agree to allow a more open, less obstructionist process when their own members face charges. It’s a good idea that I doubt will fly with many police unions.
In short, bargaining for cops doesn’t lead to the kind of win-win situation that bargaining for other workers largely produces.
The United States also has the highest rate of incarceration of any nation, and more than two million Americans are directly employed staffing our prisons and jails. While their rate of unionization is not as high as police officer rates, it’s still considerable, and many mainstream public-sector unions have prison guard locals in their ranks. These unions are beginning to come under fire for their police locals, but they haven’t yet encountered similar criticism for their guard locals.
But as the movement for decarceration grows (and it has received a boost from the downsizings of prisons due to COVID-19), the critiques of their affiliations with prison locals are likely to grow. Policing and incarceration are the nation’s most devastating expressions of our institutional racism, and unions that are otherwise champions of racial justice will find themselves hard-pressed to defend either the quality or the quantity of these institutions.
Should those institutions shrink, so will union memberships and financial resources, which is not a negligible consideration for union leaders at a moment when COVID-19 and the fiscal crisis of state and local governments stand to decimate union membership and resources, and when unions have planned to wage massive, and costly, campaigns to oust Trump and Senate Republicans over the next 100 days.
Suppose, however, that those campaigns succeed, as current polls indicate is likely. While unions, like most other institutions, will suffer so long as the pandemic persists, the public-sector unions to which police and guard unions now disproportionately belong stand to register major membership gains under a Biden presidency and a Democratic Congress, which augur to be more pro-union than the Democrats have been since the 1940s. Though it drew little public notice, one part of Biden’s recently released economic plan calls for federal legislation that would grant collective-bargaining rights to public employees. While the 1935 National Labor Relations Act conveyed such rights to private-sector workers, no such federal legislation has ever extended those rights to public employees. Some states have enacted them; many have not. Should Biden’s plan become law, unions like AFSCME and SEIU could greatly expand their memberships.
That would make disaffiliation from their police and prison guard locals, and the AFL-CIO’s disaffiliation with IUPA, a less financially onerous process. A good thing, that, since those affiliations have already come under criticism from many of labor’s staunchest supporters, including the academics and journalists who focus on unions and the working class, and from several of the nation’s most left-leaning unions, too. (Full disclosure: the Prospect union, of which I am not a member as I’m management, has formally called for disaffiliation.) And unless and until unions side with Black America, and with their own Black members, by severing their link to police unions, that criticism will only grow as more and more of labor’s liberal allies come to see how unions’ links to the police compromise their political purpose and moral clarity.
Last week, the AFL-CIO formed a task force on racial justice “to address America’s long history of racism and police violence against Black people.” We can only hope it concludes that it can’t represent both the police and its African American members. For a movement that long has sung “Which Side Are You On?” and asked the public to make a choice, labor’s inability to sever its ties with the cops means it can’t even answer its own defining question."

","African Americans, despite making up just 13% of the U.S. population, account for a staggeringly disproportionate chunk of the nation's homeless population, according to a government report.
In 2019, an estimated 568,000 Americans experienced homelessness, with African Americans making up about 40% of that total, according to the annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress. The total figure in 2018 was about 553,000.
The disparity was starker when looking at the number of homeless people with children: African Americans accounted for about 52% of that population, with whites accounting for about 35%, the report said.
In contrast, 48% of all people experiencing homelessness were white compared with 77% of the total U.S. population, while people who identify as Hispanic or Latino represented about 22% of the homeless population, but only 18% of the overall population.
""African Americans have remained considerably overrepresented among the homeless population compared to the U.S. population,"" the report said. ""This report demonstrates continued progress toward ending homelessness, but also a need to re-calibrate policy to make future efforts more effective and aligned with the unique needs of different communities.""
The U.S. Housing and Urban Development report, which came out earlier this month, was based on ""Point-In-Time Estimates of Homelessness"" taken on a single night in January 2019.
Advocates point to the compounding effects of long-standing discrimination and inequalities within the country's housing, criminal justice and health care systems to explain why African Americans make up such a large portion of the homeless population compared with their overall proportion of the general population.
""This year's report is as an urgent call to action to federal, state, and local leaders,"" Nan Roman, president and CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said in a statement in response to the report's findings. ""Now is not the time to abandon the practices that drove those results. Now is the time to get serious about funding them to scale.""
The organization's research found that poverty was a strong predictor of homelessness, and noted that African American households are much more likely to experience poverty than their white counterparts. About 21% of African Americans live in poverty -- nearly 2.5 times the rate of whites, the organization said.
""This isn't the fault of the homelessness sector, and it is not the fault of people experiencing homelessness,"" Roman said. ""It is the fault of systems that have failed our most vulnerable populations, and leaders who have failed to protect them. Our charge for 2020 is to remain committed to the best practices in ending homelessness, and to remain resolved to addressing the systems that cause people to become homeless."""
demsocialist,"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/23/18714615/bernie-sanders-free-college-for-all-2020-student-loan-debt
","Sen. Bernie Sanders’s proposal to make college free in the United States just got bigger: He wants to erase all student debt too. All $1.6 trillion of it.
The Vermont senator will unveil the most ambitious higher education plan in the Democratic 2020 presidential primary so far on Monday. The proposal would make two- and four-year public and tribal colleges and universities tuition-free and debt-free, and erase the roughly $1.6 trillion in student loan debt currently owed in the US, paid for by a tax on Wall Street.
Currently, about 45 million Americans have student loans. This would cancel debt for all of them — regardless of their income or assets. That’s a notable difference from Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s free college proposal, which also provides broad debt relief but caps it for households with incomes over $250,000.
Sanders is proposing funding streams to states, tribes, and historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to allow them to eliminate undergraduate tuition and fees. The bill would also increase spending on work-study programs and build up federal grant programs for low-income students for additional costs related to getting an education, from housing and transportation to buying books.
The proposal would cost $2.2 trillion over 10 years, which Sanders says would be paid for with his Wall Street tax. He proposed a Wall Street speculation tax in 2016, which would raise small levies on buying and selling stocks, bonds, and derivatives; many experts estimate it could raise hundreds of billions of dollars annually. Sanders’s office cited progressive economist Robert Pollin’s projection that the tax would bring in $2.4 trillion in revenues over 10 years.
Free college is one of Sanders’s signature issues. He’s called the prohibitive costs of higher education a “national disgrace.” It was one of many proposals that distinguished him in the 2016 presidential primary against Hillary Clinton, who argued the government shouldn’t subsidize education for the wealthiest Americans. Three years later, it’s clear that Sanders’s vision is ascendant in the Democratic Party.
“We believe definitionally that if you are the upper elite, that you by definition would not have had to take out student loans,” Keane Bhatt, Sanders’s spokesperson, told Vox. “There is something to be said about simple, intelligible policies that build broad constituencies.”
Sanders’s newest College for All Act, briefly explained
Here’s how Sanders’s College for All Act would work:
The federal government would give states and tribes at least $48 billion per year, through a two-to-one federal dollar match program, if states commit to eliminating tuitions and fees at public universities and colleges.
To receive the federal funding, states and tribes would have to meet some requirements: Essentially, they’d have to show the Department of Education that they will maintain higher education and need-based financial aid funding and rely less on adjunct faculty to teach classes. States and tribes would also have to show that they can cover the full cost of higher education for the poorest families, those who earn less than $25,000. For tribal colleges with at least 75 percent low-income student enrollment — students eligible for the Pell Grant — the federal government would cover 95 percent of costs to eliminate tuition and fees.
The federal funding has restrictions: It cannot go to administrators’ salaries, any merit-based financial aid, or non-academic buildings like shiny new football stadiums.
While this is a universal program — students from any financial background would benefit from the elimination of tuition — the proposal specifically targets lower-income students by increasing the federal Pell Grant program, tripling funding for the work-study program, and creating a dollar-for-dollar federal match to states to eliminate additional costs related to going to college.
HBCUs and minority-serving institutions (MSIs) would also qualify for this federal funding. Sanders’s proposal allocates $1.3 billion per year to reduce tuition and fees at private nonprofit universities and colleges with at least 35 percent of students from low-income households. Roughly 200 institutions would be eligible, Sanders’s office said.
The proposal also caps student loan interest rates to the same rate the federal government pays for its debt.
All told, this bill, introduced with progressive Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN), is a more expansive version of Sanders’s original 2016 free college proposal. What was originally a tuition-free proposal with a provision for refinancing student loans has become a debt-free and tuition-free proposal.
It’s a clear departure from the free college plan that Clinton proposed and Sanders endorsed as the 2017 College for All Act. That bill would have eliminated tuition and fees for families making up to $125,000, conceding to Clinton’s argument that the government shouldn’t have to cover costs for families who can afford to send their kids to college.
There are several Democratic candidates in the field right now who share those concerns, but Sanders is no longer heeding them.
How Sanders’s plan compares to other Democrats in the race
Sanders’s 2016 campaign normalized free college in Democratic politics. In the current field, Warren and Sanders have similar proposals with one main difference.
Warren’s student debt relief is means-tested. As Vox’s Ella Nilsen explained, Warren’s plan cancels $50,000 in student loan debt for every person with household income under $100,000, and offers “substantial debt cancellation” to every person with household income between $100,000 and $250,000. Those making above $250,000 wouldn’t qualify. In total, Warren’s plan is estimated to cost $1.25 trillion over a decade — almost a trillion less than Sanders’s.
The more centrist Democrats in the race, like former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), are proposing free two-year community college, although Biden supported four years of free college in 2015.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) has backed various proposals, including the more moderate Clinton/Sanders plan that eliminates tuition and fees for families that make up to $125,000 a year.
Meanwhile, other candidates also have put forward cost-relief proposals. Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) is proposing no-interest federal student loans. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is backing debt- and tuition-free college for lower-income families, and tuition-free college for middle-income families.
The big question: Will states buy in?
Because public colleges in the US are run at the state level, implementing a universal tuition- and debt-free college program requires the states to buy in. Sanders’s proposal, like Warren’s, requires states to enter a voluntary agreement with the federal government. As Nilsen writes, “if states don’t want to take the money, their universities are left out of the equation.”
This is the uphill battle associated with all federal-state partnership programs — and it can backfire, as with the Affordable Care Act, where many conservative states rejected the health care program’s Medicaid expansion despite a far more generous federal match.
Sanders’s team doesn’t see the ACA as a cautionary tale, though; some red states voted to expand Medicaid in the 2018 midterm elections, as Bhatt, Sanders’s spokesperson, pointed out. And that won’t be a concern for private historically black colleges that might want to participate.
One of the other biggest criticisms of universal free college and debt relief proposals is an argument Clinton made in 2016: The government shouldn’t be subsidizing school for people who can easily afford it.
“Getting to free college for everybody is not a very progressive way to approach this because a lot of wealthy kids will benefit from that,” Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), who’s running a more moderate Democratic presidential campaign, told a voter at an Iowa campaign event in May. Buttigieg made a similar argument in April.
But in Sanders’s book, Americans are entitled to “the right to a complete education.”
“You have lower-class people, middle-class people, upper-middle-class folks all getting student debt relief and bolstering the value of college,” Bhatt said of Sanders’s vision. “If Ivanka Trump decides she wants to go to [Pennsylvania State University], there is no problem with that. That’s part of the thinking.”"

","Food stamp recipients will have access to their full benefits for February, even if the partial government shutdown continues, U.S. Department of Agriculture officials announced Tuesday night.
USDA said they will work with states to load benefits onto recipients' cards by Jan. 20, just within the deadline for a provision that allows them to pay out benefits, even without a budget.
Food and Nutrition Service Administrator Brandon Lipps told reporters they expect to pay out the full $4.8 billion in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits for February, which should cover full benefits for all 38 million Americans that use the program commonly known as food stamps.
""I know there's been genuine concern across America as to what will happen to these benefits as the government shutdown continues,"" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue told reporters on Tuesday night.
""You've heard me say before our motto here at USDA is to 'do right and feed everyone.' With this solution I think we've got the feed everyone part handled and I believe that the plan we've constructed takes care of the do right part,"" he said.
People who use food stamps will be able to access them earlier than usual. USDA officials said this is similar to how they can issue benefits early during natural disasters and states will have to accelerate their normal process to distribute the benefits early.
USDA said the department is using a provision in the continuing resolution that expired on Dec. 21 that allows agencies to spend money within 30 days, even without its budget for the next fiscal year.
""The continuing resolution that just expired allows the federal government to obligate payments within 30 days of its expiration for particular programs including the SNAP program,"" Lipps said. ""States under this scenario we'll have until Jan. 20th, which is in that 30-day period, to obligate these funds and make them available on the recipient's cards which allow us to access the funds under that continuing resolution.""
Lipps said anyone applying for benefits in February should be on the standard timeline.
The department will not tap in to the $3 billion contingency fund for SNAP, which would not have been able to cover all benefits paid out every month. Some people who receive food stamps said they were worried they would have less money to buy healthy food if they only received a percentage of their usual benefits.
Danielle Baker, a mother of four in Oklahoma, told ABC News her family would have to cut back on fresh fruits and vegetables if they lost some of their benefits.
""It's just too difficult to buy fresh food with just the little bit of money we have from his paychecks,"" she told ABC News' Start Here about her husband's paycheck.
Other nutrition programs like the Women, Infants and Children program, or WIC, and programs that provide school lunches have enough money to continue into March, Lipps said.
USDA said they will immediately start looking into options to provide benefits in March as soon as February benefits are set. Perdue said he encourages congressional leaders to fully fund USDA before another solution is necessary.
""We've provided an additional month of SNAP benefits with this solution, I believe that gives Congress ample time to act,"" he told reporters."

","Fox News host Eric Shawn on Sunday challenged Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) after she claimed that the COVID-19 relief bill was delayed because Democrats ""wanted people to suffer."" ""The Democrats did not want timely relief prior to the election,"" Blackburn told Shawn in an interview on Fox News. ""They wanted people to suffer and Nancy Pelosi told us why. She said because they felt like it would help them win the election.""
Shawn interrupted: ""Do you think it really is fair to say Democrats wanted people to suffer? I mean, they don't want people to suffer."" ""They delayed relief when people were saying we desperately need relief,"" Blackburn argued. ""They delayed money to small businesses when small businesses were saying we need another round of PPP. That was a choice they made."" Blackburn went on to insist that only 9% of the latest relief bill is related to COVID-19, a claim that Politifact has rated as ""half true."" ""So whether you want to say it was fair or not fair, it is an action they took,"" the Tennessee Republican continued. ""And it is an admission that they have made. So I think it was just really unfortunate that it was their choice."" Even though Blackburn voted against the latest COVID-19 relief bill, she argued that people ""desperately need help."" ""But do you really need to bail out the blue states that have mismanaged their funds and have mismanaged their pensions?"" she quipped. ""But you also know,"" Shawn interjected, ""your state get $6 billion, Florida gets $16 billion, Texas gets $27 billion. So red states get a lot of money too."" ""It is immoral to continue to pile debt on our children and grandchildren,"" Blackburn opined. ""It is selfish not to sit down and work this out so that we are not adding to the debt. There are all sorts of good things that you can do with money but we have to remember, the federal government only has money that the taxpayer sends to them."" ""Socialism is fine until you run out of other people's money,"" she added. ""And this continuing to say you're going to pick winners and losers with federal government money, which is taxpayer money, is completely inappropriate and, yes, it does need to stop.""

","On Friday, Amazon warehouse workers and social and environmental justice activists around the world will stage a series of coordinated protests, strikes, and actions to demand the online retailer respect workers' rights to participate in union activity, stop circumventing tax laws, and commit to higher environmental standards, according to the event's organizers.
The day of action, which is being called #MakeAmazonPay, coincides with Black Friday, one of Amazon's biggest sales events of the year and the start of its peak season, when warehouse worker injuries are highest and workloads for warehouse workers and delivery drivers skyrocket. On Friday, protest actions will take place across Amazon's supply chain in Brazil, Mexico, the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Italy, Poland, India, Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Australia.

As many as 3,000 workers will strike at six Amazon facilities in Germany. Garment workers in Bangladesh who manufacture clothes sold by Amazon will also protest. Trade union members and environmental groups, including the climate-focused Extinction Rebellion, will demonstrate outside Amazon's European headquarters in Luxembourg. In the Philippines, contracted Amazon Ring call center workers, who face 'subhuman' conditions according to a recent Financial Times article, will hold a virtual action. At Amazon's Seattle and Northern Virginia headquarters, community activists from social justice organizations, including Justice for Muslims Collective and La ColectiVA, will hold their own protests.
“During the Covid-19 pandemic, Amazon became a trillion dollar corporation, with Bezos becoming the first person in history to amass $200 billion in personal wealth,"" #MakeAmazonPay's statement signed by 39 organizations and sent to Amazon reads. ""Meanwhile, Amazon warehouse workers risked their lives as essential workers, and only briefly received an increase in pay.""
""Like all major corporations, Amazon’s success would be impossible without the public institutions that citizens built together over generations,"" the statement continues. ""But instead of giving back to the societies that helped it grow, the corporation starves them of tax revenue through its world beating efforts at tax dodging.""

The actions coalesce around a common set of demands put forward by more than 50 social justice organizations on both sides of the Atlantic, including UNI Global Union, Greenpeace, the Athena Coalition, the Sunrise Movement, OxFam, Our Revolution, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, Progressive International, Public Citizen, and the Tax Justice Network.
“This is a series of misleading assertions by misinformed or self-interested groups who are using Amazon’s profile to further their individual causes,” Conor Sweeney, a spokesperson for Amazon’s Luxembourg headquarters said. “Amazon has a strong track record of supporting our people, our customers, and our communities, including providing safe working conditions and leading $15 minimum wage and great benefits, leading on climate change with the Climate Pledge commitment to be net zero carbon by 2040, and paying more than $5 billion in taxes globally.”
These demands include, but are not limited to, raising workers’ wages in all Amazon warehouses including premium pay during peak periods and hazard pay during the pandemic; reinstating all workers who have been fired after speaking up about workplace health and safety; giving unions access to Amazon worksites to speak to workers; committing to zero emissions by 2030; ending the sale of devices that rely on mass surveillance practices, such as Amazon Ring; and paying taxes in full where economic activity occurs.
""You might ask why we're targeting Amazon when our concerns exist at lots of other companies, and the answer is two fold,"" said Alex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network, a signatory of the list of common demands, and a U.K. research network focused on financial regulation. ""First, Amazon is on many issues the most extreme example. It’s the most extreme example of monopoly power and in numerous questions related to labor rights threats. The second part is that Amazon has done exceptionally well this year. If anyone has had a good pandemic, it’s Amazon. While everyone has been cursed by COVID, Amazon has done well but not because of its own merits. It’s done well because of the unprecedented state interventions to protect local health. Small businesses have been forced to close.""
""One of the things that should happen is an excess tax to put most of this money back into the public system to contribute to public health costs,"" he continued. ""If we allow Amazon to keep all these excess profits, it will only strengthen its monopoly position."""

","The staffers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks with the company took place in private meetings, said Apple was one of many U.S. companies that oppose the bill as it’s written. They declined to disclose details on the specific provisions Apple was trying to knock down or change because they feared providing that knowledge would identify them to Apple. But they both characterized Apple’s effort as an attempt to water down the bill.

“What Apple would like is we all just sit and talk and not have any real consequences,” said Cathy Feingold, director of the international department for the AFL-CIO, which has supported the bill. “They’re shocked because it’s the first time where there could be some actual effective enforceability.”
Apple spokesperson Josh Rosenstock said the company “is dedicated to ensuring that everyone in our supply chain is treated with dignity and respect. We abhor forced labor and support the goals of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. We share the committee’s goal of eradicating forced labor and strengthening U.S. law, and we will continue working with them to achieve that.” He said the company earlier this year “conducted a detailed investigation with our suppliers in China and found no evidence of forced labor on Apple production lines, and we are continuing to monitor this closely.”
Apple’s lobbying firm, Fierce Government Relations, disclosed that it was lobbying on the bill on behalf of Apple in a disclosure form that was first reported by the Information. However, the form did not say whether Apple was for or against the bill or whether it wanted to modify it in any way. Lobbying disclosure forms do not require that information. Fierce referred The Washington Post to Apple’s public relations team.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has said publicly that Apple does not tolerate forced labor in its supply chain. “Forced labor is abhorrent,” Cook said in a congressional hearing in July. “We would not tolerate it in Apple,” he said, adding that Apple would “terminate a supplier relationship if it were found.”
The new bill would make it more difficult for U.S. companies to ignore abuses taking place in China and give U.S. authorities more power to enforce the law. One provision in the bill requires public companies to certify to the Securities and Exchange Commission that their products are not made using forced labor from Xinjiang. If companies are found to have used forced labor from the region, they could be prosecuted for securities violations.

While U.S. law already prevents companies from importing goods that were made using forced labor, the law is seldom enforced, and it’s difficult to prove U.S. companies know about the use of forced labor.

The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act passed 406 to 3 in the House in September. People involved in the legislation said the apparel industry was caught off guard by how quickly it passed without much lobbying.
Now that the bill, sponsored by Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), is in front of the U.S. Senate, corporations have made more of a concerted effort to shape it, in part to blunt some of its sharper provisions, according to the two congressional staffers. Some companies have lobbied to have their names removed from the bill, these people say, because it calls out specific brands like Patagonia, Coca-Cola and Costco, for allegedly using forced labor from the region. It does not name Apple.
Patagonia, Coca-Cola and Costco didn’t respond to requests for comment.
AD
The bill is primarily focused on textiles and other low-tech industries. For instance, Xinjiang’s sugar has made its way into Coca-Cola and the tomatoes have been used in Heinz ketchup, according to human rights reports.
AD
Michael Mullen, senior vice president for Kraft Heinz, said in a written statement that the company’s suppliers are audited by a third party and that the audits have not identified “any issues.” He said if “issues related to inappropriate labor practices are discovered, we will take immediate action.” Mullen declined to name the auditing firm. Most firms have stopped auditing in Xinjiang because of limitations placed by the Chinese government.
Complying with the new bill could be costly to companies, especially in the textile industry, where cotton gets woven into garments around the world, making it difficult and expensive to trace. The Xinjiang region is known as a center for cotton production, and the apparel industry has earned most of the scrutiny for using textiles produced by allegedly forced labor in the region.
AD
The SEC portion of the bill echoes a provision in the Dodd-Frank Act that requires companies to notify the government if their products contain conflict minerals from Congo. That provision of the Dodd-Frank Act has created headaches for companies that import gold. Companies are concerned that the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act could create similar problems, according to the lawmakers.

Because China has transferred Uighur Muslims out of Xinjiang to work in other parts of the country, human rights advocates say it may be difficult for any U.S. company operating in China to ensure it isn’t benefiting, even indirectly, from forced labor.
Xinjiang, which borders Pakistan and Afghanistan, was conquered by China in the 1700s, and the Turkic Muslims who live there have long fought against Chinese rule. But in recent years, the Chinese government has been cracking down on Muslims, aided by advanced surveillance technology, such as artificial intelligence and facial recognition, a digital iron grip that has overwhelmed the population.

With an estimated 1 million to 2 million people placed in camps, human rights groups have called the situation in Xinjiang a cultural genocide. Some of those who “graduate” from the camps by renouncing Islam and learning to speak fluent Mandarin have been moved to factories in Xinjiang and surrounding regions.

China’s government has disputed the characterization of the program as “camps,” saying they were vocational training centers to reform minor criminals. Under heavy international pressure, officials declared the end of the program in December 2019, saying all students had successfully graduated. Some of the centers have been confirmed to be vacated, though some overseas Uighurs have said relatives remain detained or missing.
But China has thwarted efforts to observe human rights conditions in Xinjiang. Diplomats and foreign journalists who have visited the region almost universally report being repeatedly detained by authorities and blocked from approaching areas where camps are located. Recent satellite photos show the camps growing, not shrinking.
While it’s unknown how much electronics manufacturing occurs in the region, some human rights groups believe there are plants that make electronics components in Xinjiang. And private companies, which act as brokers for Xinjiang laborers, have arranged for workers to be transferred from concentration camps to electronics factories outside of Xinjiang, according to human rights reports.

A March report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute identified four alleged instances in which labor from the Xinjiang region has been connected to Apple’s supply chain. The report alleges that the workers were likely to have been forced or coerced, but it did not offer proof confirming the work terms and conditions.
Apple products include thousands of components that are made by suppliers all around the world. The company has a supplier code of conduct and says it assessed 1,142 suppliers in 49 countries in 2019, ensuring that good labor conditions are upheld. Apple publishes an annual progress report documenting the results. “Workplace rights are human rights. We require suppliers to provide fair working hours, a safe work site, and an environment free from discrimination,” the company says on its website.
The Australian report alleges that in 2017, the Chinese government transferred between 1,000 and 2,000 Uighurs to work at a factory owned by O-Film, which helps make selfie cameras for Apple’s iPhone. Apple’s Cook publicized his visit to an O-Film factory in December 2017, posing in a photo in front of a microscope on the factory floor, wearing a blue clean room jumpsuit. “Getting a closer look at the remarkable, precision work that goes into manufacturing the selfie cameras for iPhone 8 and iPhone X at O-Film,” Cook wrote on the Chinese social networking site Weibo.

O-Film also supplies other American companies like Dell, HP, Amazon and General Motors, according to the report. (Amazon chief executive and founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Dell spokesperson Lauren Lee said an O-Film subsidiary is a supplier for the company but that Dell does not do business with the O-Film factory named in the report. Amazon acknowledged the report and denounced forced labor in a statement on its website. General Motors, in its most recent sustainability report, said it investigated the allegations and ended its relationship with the supplier.
A Chinese newspaper article from May 2017 covered the transfer of Uighur labor to the O-Film factory. The article put a positive spin on the story, referring to the alleged forced laborers as “urban and rural surplus laborers” who had “gone out of their homes to work in the mainland to make money, and create a happy life with their hard-working hands.”
The Australian report, citing a local government document from September 2019, alleges that 560 Xinjiang laborers were transferred to the Henan province and that some of those workers ended up in Foxconn’s Zhengzhou factory, otherwise known as “iPhone City,” where half of Apple’s flagship products are assembled.
The report also cites a 2018 speech by a Chinese government official announcing the transfer of workers from Xinjiang to the Hubei Yihong factory, which the report alleges is the parent company of an Apple supplier. According to the report, the factory’s website said it supplied GoerTek, which makes Apple’s AirPods. In the speech, the official referred to the labor transfers as a “green channel” and ordered workers to be “grateful” to the Chinese Communist Party.
“Xinjiang migrant workers must regard the factory as their home and strive to be outstanding employees,” the official said. The factory also allegedly supplies other American electronics makers like Facebook’s Oculus, Microsoft and Google, according to the report. GoerTek didn’t respond to a request for comment. Frank Shaw, Microsoft’s vice president of corporate communications, said the company “determined that O-Film and Hubei Yihong are not suppliers for our devices nor for our cloud hardware businesses.” He added that Microsoft investigated alleged labor violations at Foxconn but found no wrongdoing. “We do not tolerate forced labor in our supply chain,” he said.
The Australian report also cites a 2018 article from Xinjiang Economic News, which reported that 544 Uighur students were transferred to a subsidiary of Highbroad Advanced Material, a maker of LCD and OLED components. The report alleges that Highbroad is a supplier of BOE Technology Group, a maker of OLED screens for Apple, according to Apple’s supplier list. BOE didn’t respond to a request for comment.
In August, the Tech Transparency Project uncovered shipping records showing Apple was importing cotton T-shirts from a company in Xinjiang that Congress imposed sanctions on for its alleged use of forced labor. Apple, at the time, said it does not currently import shirts from the region.
Apple has been implicated in several alleged labor abuses over the years.
“I’m not entirely surprised that Apple would be involved in trying to water down legislation that concerns protection of human rights in China,” said Maya Wang, a China researcher at Human Rights Watch. Nevertheless, she called Apple’s lobbying effort “unconscionable.”"

","Arizona Department of Corrections Arizona Department of Corrections building in Phoenix.
Inmates at the Yuma prison say they were threatened with violence and ordered by prison officials to refuse COVID-19 testing to keep outbreak numbers artificially low.
The Arizona Department of Corrections recently began conducting mass testing of all inmates across the entire state prison system, resulting in a rapid increase of COVID-19 positive cases being reported.
But before testing was scheduled to begin at the Yuma prison, inmates there say prison administrators and staff, working with informal inmate leaders called “Heads,” led a campaign of threats and intimidation to keep the rest of the inmates from submitting to the mandatory nasal swabs.
Stephanie Hale-Perry’s husband is incarcerated at the Yuma prison. She says he called her with concerns when the testing was first announced.
“The inmate leaders in his yard said that all inmates were to refuse the test, otherwise they were going to get a beat-down,” Hale-Perry said. She said the threats came after inmate Heads met with the deputy warden, correctional officers, and members of the special services investigation unit at the Yuma prison.
Two correctional officers who work at Yuma confirmed to KJZZ the meeting took place. Neither would identify themselves publicly out of fear of retaliation. One of the officers said they believed the administration was encouraging the inmate Heads to get the rest of the inmates to refuse testing, so there would be fewer positive results, and the prison yards could be reopened sooner.
“The prison administrators told the Heads ‘make sure the people in your building or in your run don’t get tested,’” Hale-Perry said. “They were threatened with getting beat up. They used violence and other threats as the scare tactic to prevent the testing from happening.”
Hale-Perry said her husband believes he and other inmates were threatened against testing for COVID-19 to keep the number of cases at the prison artificially low.
She said the inmates ultimately accepted the testing, because so many of them, including her husband, are concerned about their health.
“I’m extremely upset,” Hale-Perry said. “The Department of Corrections is playing politics with my husband’s life.”
She said her husband and other inmates were able to persuade the rest of the population to comply with the testing, despite the threats.
Suzanne McMillan’s son was also threatened against getting tested for COVID-19. Incarcerated at the Yuma prison, she says he watched the inmate Heads meet with the Department of Corrections employees before all of the inmates were told not to participate in the testing.
“The heads came into the inmate bays where they live with an SSU officer, and they told everyone ‘Do not test,’” she said. “They were told, if they accepted the testing, they would be shipped off to a different yard, lose all their possessions, and not be able to contact family members.”
McMillan said her son believes the department wanted to be able to say that inmates had refused the testing in an attempt to keep the reports of positive results down.
“I’m just so disheartened in the way ADC is responding to this crisis,” McMillan said. “I don’t trust what they do. I don’t trust what they say. I don’t believe they have the inmates’ best interests at heart.”
But McMillan said her son stood up against the intimidation. She said after the inmates were able to access news reports of testing results from other prisons in Arizona, the Yuma inmates decided it was in their best interest to participate in the testing.
Arizona Department of Corrections spokesperson Bill Lamoreaux confirmed 4,500 inmates were recently tested at the Yuma prison, and that eight inmates had refused the testing. Lamoreaux called the allegations of threats against testing “unsubstantiated.”
“ADCRR takes such allegations seriously,” Lamoreaux said. “If you have any information about credible threats, we ask you to forward them to us so they can be investigated.”
A woman KJZZ is calling Avery Contreras says her husband, an inmate at Yuma, was also threatened to refuse testing. Contreras asked to remain anonymous to protect her husband.
“The inmates were told by a correctional officer that if they agreed to the testing, they’d be moved to another yard and lose their bunk,” Contreras said. “They felt like it was a scare tactic, because ADC was listing all these repercussions that would happen if they complied with the testing.”
Contreras said her husband believes they were told not to test because “the fewer people they tested, the fewer positive results they would get back, and their numbers wouldn’t look as bad as they actually are.”
“He was very uncomfortable with the situation,” Contreras said. “He and his friends decided they were willing to take any backlash that might come because they are fearing for their lives.”

","With his fourth-place finish, Buttigieg becomes the fourth candidate to qualify for the sixth official primary debate in December, co-sponsored by POLITICO and PBS. He will join Biden, Sanders and Warren for the debate at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Gabbard also took another step toward qualifying for next month's fifth debate in Atlanta: She needs either to earn 5 percent in one more early state poll or earn at least 3 percent in two more polls, national or early state, qualification closes on Nov. 13.
The UNH poll was conducted Oct. 21-27, surveying 574 likely Democratic primary voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.
Biden has lost 9 points since the previous UNH poll, conducted in July. In that survey, Biden had a slight advantage over Sanders and Warren, who were tied for second place with 19 percent each.
Biden’s ""campaign is just not very good, and I think the age issue has hurt him,” said UNH professor Andy Smith, who conducted the poll. “If people think you’re the most electable candidate, but people don’t think you’re electable, then what else do you have? What is Joe Biden other than the most electable candidate?”
Biden does have a sizable edge in electability, the poll shows. More than 1 in 3 primary voters, 36 percent, say he's the candidate with the best chance to defeat President Donald Trump, though that's down from 45 percent who said he was the strongest general election candidate in the July survey. Eighteen percent say Warren has the best chance of winning the general election, and 14 percent say Sanders does.
But Sanders leads on other important measures: He's the top choice of voters asked which candidate is most likable (27 percent), most ""progressive"" (47 percent), best able to handle health care (33 percent) and best able to handle the ""climate crisis"" (30 percent).
The New Hampshire primary is notoriously volatile and difficult to poll, and Smith, the UNH pollster, highlighted the uncertainty, pointing out that only 23 percent of likely primary voters say they have definitively picked a candidate.
“The biggest takeaway is voters are nowhere near making up their mind,” Smith said. “There is a good chance [Biden] can recover from this. Nobody has locked this thing down."""

","A Washington Post article on the resignation of deputy Housing and Urban Development Secretary Pam Patenaude, a housing policy professional who’s been de facto running the department under the vague auspices of Ben Carson, also contains the stunning information that President Trump attempted to illegally cut off federal disaster assistance to the island of Puerto Rico.
We already knew that in October, Trump tweeted — inaccurately — that the Puerto Rican government was planning to use disaster relief money to pay off old debts.
Join the Vox Video Lab Go behind the scenes. Chat with creators. Support Vox video. Become a member of the Vox Video Lab on YouTube today. (Heads up: You might be asked to sign in to Google first.)
But the new report says Trump went beyond bad tweets and tried to base policy on this misapprehension, urging his team to violate the law and redirect the disaster assistance money to Texas and Florida instead:
Trump told then-White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and then-Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney that he did not want a single dollar going to Puerto Rico, because he thought the island was misusing the money and taking advantage of the government, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive internal deliberations. Instead, he wanted more of the money to go to Texas and Florida, the person said. “POTUS was not consolable about this,” the person said. Patenaude told White House budget officials during an early December meeting in the Situation Room that the money had been appropriated by Congress and must be sent, according to two people with direct knowledge of the meeting. She assured them that HUD had proper oversight of the funds.
This is shocking on its own terms, but many shocking things come to light in any given week of the Trump administration. Misconduct related to the handling of Hurricane Maria is, however, especially noteworthy because it stands at the intersection of all the major themes of his administration — incompetence, disregard for legal niceties, racial animus, and a Republican Party that’s completely abdicated its obligations of constitutional oversight.
Trump has only faced one really bad crisis, and he botched it
George W. Bush’s administration’s first term was defined by 9/11, and Barack Obama’s by the financial crisis. Trump has not faced a comparable dominant external challenge.
But Hurricane Maria — a punishing storm that hit an island with rickety infrastructure — is the closest he’s come, a problem that he did not cause and that any administration would struggle to handle. Trump did not just struggle with Maria; he failed miserably. To the best of our knowledge, thousands of people died due to the hurricane and months of ensuing blackouts. Trump’s only reaction has been to get angry at people who point out how bad it was.
Presidents have a range of formal and informal powers, and one of the most important informal ones is to convey to the bureaucracy and to second-tier political appointees what they think their priorities should be.
Trump has never, in any way, conveyed an interest in promoting recovery in Puerto Rico. What we learned Thursday is that he’s actually done the opposite — he demonstrated a personal desire, grounded in ignorance or racism or both, in making sure that help did not arrive on the island. That’s a catastrophe for the people directly affected, who are US citizens, but also an incredibly scary precedent for the rest of us.
The same congressional Republicans who managed to hold dozens of hearings on Benghazi never made any effort to find out what actually went wrong with the Hurricane Maria response or why. Now that Democrats are in the majority, that’s going to change, and there will finally be an investigation of the biggest tragedy of Trump’s time in office. Based on what we’ve learned today, that’s long overdue."

","He gives thoughtful gifts
Paul Feig, who directed the finale, described the bounty the actor gave away at his farewell party in an interview with the Los Angeles Times::
""You definitely saw presents being handed around. Steve was even giving out presents to the cast and the crew. I remember seeing them delivered to people’s dressing rooms. But they must've been very personal, because people weren’t really sharing what they got.""
His gifts aren't always as tangible. During the 2007 writers' strike, Carell, in a show of solidarity, called in sick with case of ""enlarged balls."" Without the show's star, production on new episodes was quickly abandoned.
He brings out the best in his peers
Feig told E! that in tonight's episode ""everyone gets a moment [with Carell] that you would want them to have."" All the tears shed in the wake of his departure are a ""a proper outpouring of emotion for a man who is completely deserving of getting that much [attention]."". He elaborated on Carell's ability to elevate his fellow performers in an interview with IFC: ""Steve's just one of the best comedic actors...just best actors, period, but he has an ability to ground everything,""
He makes people cry
About those tears. There wasn't a dry eye in the house when Carell was filming his final scenes. Don't take our word for it: In their own words, here are members of the cast and crew describing how they struggled to keep their emotions under control during those last days.
I definitely cried on the last day. Wasn’t expecting it and then the last scene of the day was our goodbye of characters. We hadn’t said goodbye and so that was an incredibly existential black hole. It was like way too much happening. So there were definitely tears.” -- John Krasinski (""Jim"")
""[Co-star] Angela [Kinsey] and I have cried a lot and that's the hardest thing to let go of."" -- Jenna Fischer (""Pam"")
""[T]he last day of shooting with Steve was more intense than I anticipated it would be,” Wilson continued. “There actually wasn’t a dry eye in the house. It was really sad. It was very difficult to make comedy when there was a heaviness hanging over the proceedings."" -- Rainn Wilson (""Dwight"")
""I had a Dr. Seuss quote engraved on [a desk clock he gave to Carell] -- 'Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened' -- because that's how I faced [Carell's last] week ""-- Paul Feig
""It was really emotional. We cried a lot. All of us."" -- Angela Kinsey (""Angela"")
Feig recalls things were particularly glum while filming an all cast singalong to the Rent song ""Seasons of Love"" for last week's episode.It was so emotional!,"" said Feig. ""I was prepping [for the next episode] and my assistant said, 'You should come down here.' The first time they started singing that song, everyone choked up in real life.

","Anti-hunger experts warned that several other federal food programs are also set to expire, causing food banks across the country to lose about 50 percent of the food they receive from the Agriculture Department, even as food banks report an average 60 percent increase in need.
AD
AD
The program has gone through four rounds of funding since it began this spring: $1.2 billion in contracts were awarded in the first round, $1.76 billion in the second, and $1 billion in the third. The fourth round was cut to $500 million. The USDA, in a statement, acknowledged that the amount of funding in that last round, which covered November and December, “resulted in some non-profits being unable to participate and fewer box deliveries.”
But the USDA added that many nonprofit organizations chose to receive the boxes at a higher rate earlier in the program with the understanding that this would deplete supplies for the last two months of the year. But multiple nonprofit organizations interviewed by The Washington Post said they were not apprised of the limited food resources for this round.
“The needs are beyond what we can comprehend,” said Lawdia Kennedy, who oversees a biweekly food drive in suburban Atlanta. “We had three truckloads scheduled for Saturday and they just vanished. Six states are right now being told there will be no food, right before Christmas. It’s hard to put into words what this means for the families I serve.”
Kennedy, who runs a nonprofit called Queen Material Community Center, scrambled unsuccessfully to find an alternative source of food. “I’ve been telling people that [the food drive] is postponed and might happen next weekend,” she said, “but that hope is turning into a lie.”
Likewise, the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank has seen “a huge decrease” in the number of boxes it receives from the program, according to David May, director of marketing and communications. “We are currently receiving 100,000 pounds of [boxes] per week, while we were receiving 3 million pounds per week during the summer,” May said.
In Florida, the shortfall in the Farmers to Families program was evident Saturday in the parking lot of a shuttered motel about a dozen miles from Disney World. At 6:45 a.m., Yrais Vinana sat in her car, engine off, surrounded by hundreds of laid-off workers who had begun queuing up before dawn for food.
AD
AD
Until this past week, the food drive, run by the Society of St. Andrew, an anti-hunger charity, and the Unite Here Local 737 union, had distributed $155,805 worth of Farmers to Families food boxes every Saturday. For the past two months, Vinana, who is on furlough from her custodial job at Disney’s Grand Floridian property, could count on receiving one or two 32-pound boxes of food that typically included fresh fruit, milk, meat and cheese — enough to feed her family for three or four days. In Florida, the USDA contracted with Oakes Farms, a major food distributor, to supply the boxes each week.
This past Saturday was different. Instead of boxes of fresh food paid for by the federal government, the union dipped into its savings and raised money on Facebook to buy ramen, canned vegetables and Goya beans at Walmart.
When the line began moving around 7 a.m., trunks popped open and volunteers, many of whom were also laid-off Disney workers, tossed in the plastic bags of food.
AD
AD
“One bag per car, no exceptions,” yelled Jeremy Haicken, president of Unite Here Local 737. Almost under his breath, he added, “People can’t believe the government promised food and reneged.”
Trunk lids slammed. Masked volunteers called out, “Have a good one!” Vinana exited the parking lot and turned onto a gritty stretch of highway lined with mini-golf courses, massage parlors, escape rooms, pawnshops and “family fun centers.” She and others in the food line wouldn’t realize how paltry this week’s assistance was until they unpacked their bags at home.
***
The Farmers to Families Food Box program began in May in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the crippling recession and the giant food lines forming across the country. It launched amid great fanfare and with the backing of President Trump’s daughter Ivanka.
AD

The program paid large food distributors to supply food boxes to nonprofits running food lines across the country. The smaller $500 million award for the program’s fourth phase has left some communities that took part in the spring and summer without a critical source of food this winter. The Adirondack region of New York, for example, received food for the first three rounds but was not selected for the final round, according to John Bernardi of the United Way of the Adirondack Region.
“That left a palpable void. The turnout had been unbelievable through the spring and summer. The boxes were really outstanding, with fresh food, meat and dairy,” Bernardi said. “This has left the food pantries overwhelmed.”
Other regions received funding for the most recent round, but it wasn’t enough to sustain them through the end of the year. Oakes Farms, a major Florida-based farming and food distribution company, was awarded $68 million in late October to supply food boxes in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky and the Virgin Islands. Two weeks into the program, Oakes officials said they realized that the money was not going to last, said Steve Veneziano, the company’s vice president. Veneziano said he and other Oakes executives assumed that the USDA would supply extra funds to meet the growing need in December. But the cash never came.
“We just didn’t know until it was too late,” he said. “The demand was just so overwhelming. We really needed two to two and a half times the award. We could’ve easily spent $150 million.”
The impact of that shortage quickly rippled through the Southeast last week as Veneziano called the food drives he was scheduled to supply to tell them that there was no money left for food. One of the first calls he made was to Kelly Stainner, who as program coordinator for the Florida chapter of the Society of St. Andrew is one of Oakes’s largest customers. Stainner’s group is responsible for distributing about 10,000 Oakes-supplied food boxes each week to nonprofit partners such as the Unite Here 737 local, which runs the Kissimmee food distribution site.
AD
AD
“Is there anything you can do?” Stainner recalled several of her partners asking her.
“I’ve tried. I’ve begged,” she told them. “There’s just no money.”
The shortfall in funds also took Mary Diez-Castillo, vice president of Vision Community Outreach in Hialeah, Fla., completely by surprise. She was supposed to get 12,000 boxes last week from Oakes, but instead got zero. “We were getting 5 to 6 tractor trailers a day,” she said. “We fed 275,000 people in the month of November. We set up in shopping centers, in parks, in all the cities around here.”
The bad news sent her searching for alternatives. She cold-called 27 produce companies asking for donations and pivoted briefly to Mac Edwards Produce in the Doral area. But it, too, ran out of food money on Nov. 30.
AD
“We are a nonprofit, run by volunteers with no salaries,” she said as she drove Friday to South Florida in search of food.
Like Haicken and Local 737, she is committed to continuing to provide food to laid-off workers until Congress passes a new relief bill, which could provide additional, emergency funding for the USDA food program. “We thought this would run until Dec. 31,” she said. “We’ll keep insisting. We won’t give up.”
The unexpected shortfall in the Farmers to Families Food Box program could be the first of several hits facing food banks across the country this winter.
AD
The Food Purchase and Distribution Program, a component of the Trump administration’s aid to farmers who were suffering from the trade war with China, allocated $7.1 billion for direct food purchases for food assistance. The initiative bought commodity foods directly from farmers and distributed those goods to food banks. It ends Dec. 31.
AD
These two programs alone accounted for 1.7 billion of the 5 billion meals distributed by Feeding America, a nationwide network of more than 200 food banks, said Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, the organization’s chief executive.
In total, food banks across the country are poised to lose about half of the food they have been receiving free from the federal government, Babineaux-Fontenot said.
Forty percent of people turning to American food banks have never relied on them before, she added. Many of these newcomers, who are unfamiliar with other federal food assistance programs, turn first to the food lines that depend on the food box program for help. Based on estimates of increased unemployment and poverty, food insecurity could rise from 35 million at the start of 2020 to 50 million people by year’s end.
AD
AD
Currently, about $236 million in USDA funding is available for states to spend as part of the Emergency Food Assistance Program, a much smaller federal program that provides low-income Americans with emergency food assistance at no cost, and another $183.3 million is available from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. But it is unclear how, or how swiftly, states could utilize these funds to make up for the loss of food boxes or other federal aid.
Of all the federal programs, the shortfall to the Farmers to Families Food Box program is perhaps the most urgent, because it is hitting families now. Peter Sharma, the owner of the Seasons Florida Resort in Kissimmee, which opened its parking lot to the weekly food drive, watched on Saturday morning as the union volunteers organized 20-bushel laundry bins full of the hastily assembled food bags.
The hotel has been closed since March, Sharma’s 24 employees furloughed.
Sharma recently put his house on the market to raise money to pay his annual tax bill. If it sells, he and his wife plan to move into his empty motel and wait for the tourists to return, hopefully by this summer.
Most weeks he asks the union to set aside some of the USDA food boxes for his furloughed employees. This week they would have to get by with the union-purchased plastic bags of beans and ramen."

","× Expand John Minchillo/AP Photo Protesters march on the Brooklyn Bridge, June 4, 2020
New York’s June 23 Democratic primary produced some seismic results. The 16-term chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, was defeated by Jamaal Bowman, a principal from the Bronx; and the state is set to send the first two gay Black men to Congress, Ritchie Torres (who is also Latino) and Mondaire Jones.
Bowman, Torres, and Jones all had convincing victories that were apparent, if unofficial, shortly after Election Day. But for weeks, results were delayed for a fascinating slate of progressive and democratic socialist candidates, which denied their victories any real role in the resulting discourse. All five state legislative races targeted by the Democratic Socialists of America—two state Assembly seats and two state Senate seats in Brooklyn (one held by an incumbent democratic socialist, Julia Salazar), and a state Assembly district in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s turf in Queens—resulted in victories.
Jabari Brisport, a math teacher who had run as a Green for City Council in 2017, won the Brooklyn Senate seat. Phara Souffrant Forrest, a Haitian American nurse, won an Assembly seat that mostly overlapped with Brisport’s. Marcela Mitaynes, a Peruvian American tenants’ rights activist, won the other Brooklyn seat, while Zohran Mamdani, a foreclosure counselor, won the Queens seat. Another DSA member not endorsed by the organization, Emily Gallagher, defeated a 24-term incumbent. Several left-wing Assembly candidates backed by the Working Families Party also won: Khaleel Anderson and Jessica González-Rojas defeated machine politicians in Queens, and Anna Kelles picked up an Assembly seat in Ithaca.
The result, which will be confirmed after the general election in November, will establish one of the most left-wing legislatures in New York in decades.
The result, which will be confirmed after the general election in November, will establish one of the most left-wing legislatures in New York in decades. Just a few short years ago, a block of right-leaning Senate Democrats caucused with Republicans, putting the chamber under GOP control. In 2021, not only will Democrats control both chambers, but there will be more self-described socialists in Albany than at any time since 1920, the height of the post-Bolshevik Red Scare, when five members of the Socialist Party of New York were expelled from the chamber for being “unfit for membership.” A century later, those five have now been replaced, and then some.
WHAT CAN EXPLAIN this resurgence of the party’s left wing in the hotbed of New York City? Sochie Nnaemeka, the New York state director of the Working Families Party, argues that the collected victories represent the electoral response to two crises: police brutality and COVID-19. “The victories were a response to the conditions that we were living in, where on the one hand you have a global pandemic causing economic dislocation and killing thousands, and on the other New York being at the epicenter of a crisis; hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers were marching in the street in response to the crisis of police brutality,” she said. “So what we saw was a real connection and clarity about the need to connect the protest movements; to take the grief and anger that New Yorkers were feeling and turning it into electoral action.”

Sumathy Kumar, the co-chair of New York City DSA, said that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s success helped to pave the road for the organization, giving them a blueprint for victory. Ocasio-Cortez endorsed four out of the five candidates on DSA’s 2020 slate.
“AOC made winning feel more possible to folks,” said Kumar. “For working-class people of color, her victory made them think, ‘I can run too and I can win.’” She added that the AOC race stressed to NYC DSA the importance of standing up a professional campaign infrastructure, adding organizing muscle to ideas attractive to the city’s young and diverse population. “Now DSA feels like it can be a one-stop shop for people running for office. Which is really exciting that we can fill all of our roles that a campaign needs to win.”
The victories come in advance of 2021 municipal elections in New York City, when all 50 members of the City Council are up, as well as the mayor, the public advocate, the comptroller, and the district attorneys of Brooklyn and Manhattan. The latter is the most powerful DA in the nation, as they often take the lead in prosecuting Wall Street cases. The transformations of city politics at the state and federal level are coming to the city as well.
One of the most concrete policy areas where the victories for the left will have an impact is on housing policy, as one-quarter of renters in New York City have not made payments since March, on top of a pre-existing affordability crisis. The winning candidates have pledged expanded rent control protections and a pied-à-terre tax, which would charge people living outside the city for vacant luxury properties.
One of the most concrete policy areas where the victories for the left will have an impact is on housing policy.
The state legislative victories “were about the tenant movement gaining strength,” said Cea Weaver, coordinator of the Housing Justice for All coalition, which won a transformative expansion of renters’ rights in New York in 2019. “Of the people that were elected, three of them had been arrested protesting for affordable housing in the recent movement.”
Given that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is often hostile to progressive policy, Weaver and her allies are hoping the new members can pressure New York Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins. “Phara, Jabari, or Marcela alone are not going to be able to take on Gov. Cuomo,” said Weaver. “Their goal is to develop a caucus that will force Carl and Andrea to work together to force Cuomo to make different policies.”
JABARI BRISPORT GREW UP in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, in a union household. His father was a member of the Sheet Metal Workers, and his mother, the Communications Workers of America. As he put it, “Social justice was always accessible in my household.” Brisport, who is 33 and identifies as LGBTQ, got his start in political action advocating for same-sex marriage in New York state in 2009. “That was the first time I got really involved to get friends to call their state senators,” said Brisport. “I was getting people to advocate and lobby. When we lost, it made me feel like a second-class citizen.”

Brisport returned to the phones and the streets in 2011 and helped to secure same-sex marriage rights in the state. “That showed me the power of political action,” he said. The bug caught, Brisport went on to get involved with the Black Lives Matter movement after the shooting death of Michael Brown.
The first electoral campaign that Brisport got involved with was Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign, because “if I got someone elected who I agreed with, I would have to protest a lot less,” he said. That summer, he started to study political theory. “I put it together that slavery was an example of capitalism, where Black people were traded on the open market and used as collateral for banks, and seeing how racialized capitalism was holding Black people back, and how the pursuit of money was keeping Black people down.” The next year, Brisport joined DSA, impressed with its campaigning approach. He made the decision to run for office the night of Trump’s election, thinking, “This is a nightmare. I have to do something. Wasn’t even set for City Council. I have to run for local office to defend my community.”
The next year, Brisport took 29 percent of the vote as a Green, an impressive tally for a third-party candidate in a city dominated by the Democratic Party. With the victories of AOC and Julia Salazar in 2018, Brisport felt that he could win in a contested Democratic primary.
The following year, in Brisport’s meetings with the electoral branch of DSA, “I brought up a deep desire to not run alone this time, because running for office is a really lonely thing,” he said. Eventually, DSA recruited a slate of candidates.
The slate created a community, Brisport explained. “We had a group text—‘Are you stressed?’ ‘I’m stressed too,’” he said. “It was really nice. It was great too from an organizing standpoint to amplify each other’s voices together. We released joint policy platforms. Phara and my campaigns were intricately connected.”
Brisport bristles at the notion that democratic socialism is restricted to white millennials. Issues like charter schools pulling funds from public education and the crisis of private-sector health care are universal, he said. “It’s funny, when I was running my sister was saying, ‘Stop saying you’re a socialist, people may not want to vote for you.’ But older Black voters agree with basically everything that socialists say.”
Brisport bristles at the notion that democratic socialism is restricted to white millennials.
Phara Souffrant Forrest’s impetus to run came from a realization that politics was dominated by the well-off. Forrest attended public schools both in K-12 and in college and graduate school, and started working at age 16, eventually becoming a nurse. “I just felt that there weren’t enough working-class people in office,” Forrest said. “That’s why we’re getting a lot of inappropriate policies passed without the input of regular people.”
Forrest, who was born and raised in Crown Heights, is the progeny of Haitian immigrants. Her mom is a union health care worker, and her late father was a union baker. Her stepfather worked as a taxi driver. She is still living in the apartment that she has lived in since she was two, and she formally decided to run after she was arrested at a tenants’ rights protest in Albany in June 2019, and the police became violent. “We had planned this, we’re ready for this, but we weren’t ready for violence,” she said. “I just want to pay the rent with a little dignity and you’re beating me up for this.”
Forrest’s father was part of the Haitian diaspora that was active in supporting Fanmi Lavalas, the political party of former liberation theologian priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was ousted in U.S.-backed coups in 1991 and 2004. She grew up in that political culture, joining her father at protests over Haiti and police brutality.
As a leader in the Crown Heights Tenant Union, Forrest was seen as a natural political leader. “People had approached me to run, before the protest, and my response was, ‘Hell no! I’m a nurse,’” she said. “After the protest, I said, ‘OK fine, I’ll run.’”
Forrest’s campaign prioritized relationship-building and organizing over winning support from existing power brokers. Once the slate had developed a common platform, the organizing came naturally. “People had way bigger buy-in than just supporting me as an individual,” said Forrest. “We got buy-in through the issues.”
THE WORKING FAMILIES PARTY has been winning campaigns in New York since the late 1990s, and is a more sophisticated operation, with a significant number of highly qualified paid staff. This storehouse of talent and knowledge was critical to many of the victories, especially Bowman’s, who faced an avalanche of outside spending. The DSA’s organizing operation, on the other hand, thrived due to motivated volunteers drawn to the agenda of its endorsed candidates.
“As socialists, we know that the only way we’re going to win is through people power,” said DSA’s Kumar. “That’s why we concentrate on base-building and training our members to become organizers who can work really hard. The ideology undergirds the whole project.”
That played out dramatically for Brisport’s and Forrest’s campaigns, the candidates said. In the month of the election, Forrest’s campaign was able to set up a new volunteer shift of at least 15 people every three hours. They would engage in phone and text banking, and relational organizing, with get-out-the-vote volunteers reaching out to their own networks within the district. “We had at least 2,000 postcards—people handwriting postcards,” said Forrest. “It all started in October, but to see what we had built by the end of June was phenomenal.”
In the midst of the pandemic, “I would let volunteers know that you might be the first person they talk to all day.”
Despite the inability to knock doors because of the pandemic, organizers stressed to volunteers to engage voters in meaningful conversations about the issues. “We were talking to people about a vision for politics and connecting it to their personal narratives,” said Fainan Lakha, Brisport’s campaign manager.
The victories have already had a concrete impact on the 2021 elections in New York City, and have given energy to the national DSA’s other targeted campaigns this election cycle, mainly Jackie Fielder’s insurgent campaign for state Senate in San Francisco. Soon after their victories were announced, the winning New York candidates co-hosted a national online fundraiser for Fielder, who did well in the March primaries and has a shot after her opponent, incumbent Scott Wiener, needlessly enraged the building trades unions (typically a pillar of the right of the Democratic Party in California), leading most of them to withdraw their endorsements.
Kumar is hopeful about collaborating with the Working Families Party in their joint efforts to transform politics in the city and state. Tiffany Cabán, the insurgent socialist who lost a campaign for district attorney of Queens by 60 votes in 2019, has indicated that she will run for City Council in a district overlapping DSA Assemblyman-elect Zohran Mamdani’s. She is a strong favorite to win. Brisport has discussed the goal of electing a majority-socialist City Council in 2021.
Brisport emphasized the human connection of their people-powered campaigns. In the midst of the pandemic, “I would let volunteers know that you might be the first person they talk to all day,” said Brisport. “Be aware of that and be aware of the beauty you are spreading right now.”"

","“It may have been inevitable that eventually you would have two candidates representing each side of the ideological divide in the party. A lot of smart people I’ve talked to lately think there’s a very good chance those two end up being Biden and Sanders,” said David Brock, a longtime Hillary Clinton ally who founded a pro-Clinton super PAC in the 2016 campaign. “They’ve both proven to be very resilient.”
Democratic insiders said they are rethinking Sanders’ bid for a few reasons: First, Warren has recently fallen in national and early state surveys. Second, Sanders has withstood the ups and downs of the primary, including a heart attack. At the same time, other candidates with once-high expectations, such as Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Beto O’Rourke, have dropped out or languished in single digits in the polls.
“I believe people should take him very seriously. He has a very good shot of winning Iowa, a very good shot of winning New Hampshire, and other than Joe Biden, the best shot of winning Nevada,” said Dan Pfeiffer, who served as an adviser to former President Barack Obama. “He could build a real head of steam heading into South Carolina and Super Tuesday.”
The durability of Sanders’ candidacy has come as a surprise even in some states where he performed strongly in 2016 and where he is attempting to improve his standing ahead of the 2020 election.
California state Sen. Scott Wiener, who defeated a Sanders-backed Democrat for his seat in the liberal-heavy San Francisco area in 2016, said Sanders has been “more resilient than I anticipated.”
“But in retrospect,” he added, “he has a very, very loyal following, and people have really stuck with him.”
Sanders is in second place in national polls, nearly 9 percentage points behind Biden, according to the most recent RealClearPolitics average. He is second in Iowa and first in New Hampshire. The latest CNN poll found he has the highest net favorability rating of any Democratic presidential candidate.
While Sanders’ supporters complain relentlessly that he has received less attention from the media than other candidates, he has also avoided sustained criticism that some of his rivals have suffered. That could be helping him, especially compared with Warren, who has recently come under fire from the left and center for her health care plan.
“If you really think about it, Bernie hasn’t been hit a lot with anything. It’s not like he’s getting hit by other campaigns,” said Michael Ceraso, a former New Hampshire director for Pete Buttigieg’s campaign who worked for Sanders in 2016.
“You sort of take for granted that he, like Biden, are institutional figures for very different reasons,” Ceraso said. “Early in the campaign, Bernie’s people said, ‘Look, this guy in these early states has a nice hold, and there’s a percentage of supporters, a quarter of the electorate will potentially go for him.'” He added, “It waned a little bit because people were looking at other options … and now they’re saying, ‘Wait a minute, this guy has been the most consistent of anyone.'”
At the beginning of the year — another high point for Sanders’ campaign, before Warren surged — some establishment Democrats talked about how to stop his momentum. Brock, who has a close relationship with many Democratic donors, said he has not heard anything like that in recent weeks: “That doesn’t mean it won’t happen. This is more of an analysis in the political world than in the donor world.”
Many moderate Democrats still dismiss Sanders’ candidacy. They believe his so-called ceiling remains intact and that Warren will depress any room for growth he might otherwise have.
“He can’t win the nomination,” said Matt Bennett, co-founder of the center-left group Third Way, adding that Sanders’ uptick is simply him “bouncing around between his ceiling and his floor a little bit more than people had thought he would.”
On the other hand, he acknowledged his staying power. “Not until the very end will people say to Bernie Sanders, ‘When are you dropping out?’”
A series of TV segments around last week’s Democratic debate illustrate the shift in how Sanders is being perceived. “We never talk about Bernie Sanders. He is actually doing pretty well in this polling,” former senior Obama adviser David Axelrod said on CNN after the event. “He’s actually picked up. And the fact is Bernie Sanders is as consistent as consistent can be.”
The same day on MSNBC, national political correspondent Steve Kornacki said, “Democratic voters like him, and if he starts winning, there could be a bandwagon effect.” GOP pollster Frank Luntz, who conducted a California focus group that found most participants thought Sanders had won the debate, said on CNBC, “I think you’re going to see continued movement. Sanders has been gaining in California over the past two months.”
Larry Cohen, chairman of the pro-Sanders group Our Revolution, said Warren’s candidacy is not a problem for Sanders if both of them can — together — amass a plurality of delegates heading into the convention.
“The math is that if you think of the voters for Warren and the voters for Sanders as two circles, yes, there is overlap, [but] most of the circles are separate,” Cohen said. “I think between them, we can get to a majority.”"

Google has relied on temporary workers even when the work has become more permanent.
When the company started a research project code-named Pygmalion in 2014 to improve its speech-recognition technology, it hired temporary employees — many of whom had doctorates in linguistics — to help annotate and structure data so Google’s computers could better understand what people were saying, according to five people familiar with the project.
The team grew to about 250, and the majority were contractors. Some contractors worked two years on the project, which is Google’s limit, and took a six-month break before returning in a similar role.
As the project grew, Google managers pressed contractors to do more. In a complaint to the human resources department, one full-time employee said project leaders pressured contractors to work longer hours than stated in their contracts without reporting overtime. The project leaders made subtle promises of conversion to full-time status, two of the employees said.
Google said it had learned of a possible violation in February and immediately opened an investigation, which is still continuing, into unpaid overtime. The company said it instructed employees not to promise temps future employment.
“Our policy is clear that all temporary workers must be paid for any overtime worked,” Ms. Naughton said. “If we find that anyone isn’t properly paid, we make sure they are compensated appropriately and take action against any Google employee who violates this policy.”
States and the federal government are trying to define the distinction between contractors and employees more clearly. The difference usually depends on how much control the company exercises over the worker. That is based on certain criteria, like whether the company has the power to hire or fire the employee, or supervise and control work schedules or conditions of employment. As a result, companies keep contingent workers at arm’s length."

","NEW YORK — Amazon made a big splash this week with its $15 an hour minimum wage announcement, but lost in the fine print: Existing warehouse workers will no longer receive stock in the company or collect bonuses.
The online giant says next month it will end bonuses, which paid workers extra based on their attendance and warehouse productivity, as it boosts its minimum wage.
Amazon will also phase out its restricted stock unit program, which gave shares to workers if they stayed with Amazon for a certain amount of years. Amazon says it will replace it with a program next year that will allow workers to buy stock, but didn't provide details.

","The coronavirus pandemic compounds an already dire financial situation for millions of Americans.
One-third of homeowners have less than $500 or, worse, nothing set aside for an emergency home repair, according to a report released Wednesday, and that includes 50% of homeowners with an annual household income of less than $50,000.
There’s growing concern among many Americans — especially those who are most in need of the checks and already have bills piling up — that the economy won’t restart in time to save them from paying the rent, their mortgage and going hungry.
The survey found that over half of homeowners (53%) have experienced a home repair emergency in the past 12 months. The poll, conducted online by The Harris Poll on behalf of HomeServe, a home-repair company, questioned 1,400 homeowners.
Some 38% of Americans could not come up with $500 in cash without selling something or taking out a loan, another report released Wednesday from SimplyWise, a website that gives advice on Social Security; 1 in 10 are planning to withdraw from their emergency savings to pay bills.
What’s more, nearly 25% of all Americans had no emergency savings and 16% have taken on more debt, and nearly one-third of households reported lower income since the start of the pandemic, a separate report by Bankrate.com concluded.

“The pandemic is deepening the financial hardship for millions of Americans,” Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride said. “The financial legacy of this pandemic will be elevated unemployment, reduced household incomes, more debt and even less savings.”
The pandemic has hit the Northeast hard, with 36% of Northeasterners reporting a fall in income, compared to 31% in the West, 29% in the Midwest, and 28% in the South. People in the Northeast are also more likely to have increased debt than those in those other regions.
The $1,200 stimulus checks money can’t come soon enough for the roughly 40 million people who are out of work, and others worried about bills and rent. They also can receive $600 per week extra in unemployment insurance as part of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act.
Gallup data released Monday add more support to previous research that less-educated workers in low-wage, blue-collar roles have been hardest hit by COVID-19, and suggest the pandemic is “exacerbating the income inequality that existed before its arrival.”

Some 95% of workers in low-income households — making less than $36,000 per year — have either been laid off as a result of the coronavirus (37%) or have experienced a loss in income (58%). A quarter of workers earning between $90,000 and $180,000 a year saw an income loss.
“These patterns were predicted in the early stages of the pandemic, and proposals for relief called for targeted and proportional funding,” Jonathan Rothwell, the principal economist at Gallup, said. Three in 10 U.S. job openings disappeared since March, recruitment company Glassdoor added.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, +1.85% and the S&P 500 SPX, +1.95% were slightly lower Tuesday, as markets digested the different messaging on the prospects of a second wave, well as possible progress in COVID-19 vaccine research.
By Monday, investors in S&P 500 index stocks had recovered all losses for the year, following data published last Friday that showed American employment surprisingly increased from April to May. The World Bank sees the global economy shrinking by 5.2% this year due to the pandemic."

","MK Lees and Marianne Garneau look at leftists’ poor track record in workplace organizing campaigns
There is often a temptation when starting out organizing to focus on people you think may be politically left – to reach out to these people first, or even to invite them onto your organizing committee.
“He’s in DSA”
“She posts guillotine memes”
“They wore one of those IWW ‘General Strike’ t-shirts to work one day!”
These people are already ideologically pro-union therefore they should be predisposed to engage in a class struggle, right?
Not so fast. In almost every campaign either of us have ever been involved in, and in dozens of stories from fellow organizers, the overwhelming trend is for otherwise proud leftists to show themselves as flakes at best, or actively undermining organizing at worst. Here are just a few examples.
Flakes, turncoats and rogues
In a flagship IWW campaign, the entire staff signs up with IWW memberships — but for one holdout. This person was always “very gung-ho” on social media about social justice issues, says a coworker. “Always posting about unions, issues with racism, immigration, economic disparity… A labor activist guy.” But when it comes time to take out a red card, he refuses, and even cozies up to the boss after the union goes public.
Another worker from the same campaign, hired after the union went public, is active in the DSA, and “always doing fundraisers for justice organizations and non-profits,” according to another worker. But unlike the majority of his coworkers, he refuses to join the union.
During the strike at Mini Mart in the late 1990s the only person to scab is a leftist and fan of Noam Chomsky.
A wobbly in the Pacific Northwest who has been trying to organize his small shop relates this about a coworker:
I met him through Rojava solidarity activist circles before I started working there. He’s the “leftist professor” type in the shop, reads all the philosophy books and listens to Murray Bookchin books on tape. He asked me about organizing once about six months ago, very off the cuff, we had lunch and had a short conversation about it. I tried to follow up with him regularly for a while, and he ignored my texts. When I finally got to [talk to] him in person, he told me that “anarcho-syndicalism is a failed revolutionary practice for late capitalism,” that unions had outlived their usefulness as a revolutionary vehicle, and that he is planning on opening a small business.
An organizer with the SEIU, involved in post-secondary faculty campaigns, relates how hard it is to sign up leftist academics:
There was one adjunct prof at [redacted] college that my coworker and I went in to talk to. My coworker was listening to their lecture before the end of class. It was all about feminism and bell hooks and radical, revolutionary ideas. But this person was not interested, not supportive in any way of the union. I’ve seen that so many times in academia: the Marxist professor, or the prof who can talk about really radical ideas, when it comes to putting some of those radical ideas into action, they are nowhere to be seen.
Another organizer, with another union, also involved in faculty campaigns, offers a frustratingly similar problem: “many faculty refuse to get involved with the union because it’s not left enough. Not anarchist enough.” Some, she says, “refuse to even sign a card.”
In fact, leftists often use their politics to argue for why they shouldn’t join the union. In the IWW’s Chicago Couriers Union in the mid-2000s, one messenger was a member of the Workers World Party. On the few occasions he showed up to meetings, he objected to the idea of the IWW being the union for messengers, instead advocating for calling up the SEIU. But he never did anything to organize his coworkers or support the organizing that was taking place.
Too left, not left enough, a leftist loves to “goldilocks” the union. Considering how little these folks do to build power with their coworkers, it often seems like little more than an excuse.
The problem with leftists isn’t always a matter of flaking. Sometimes leftists do get involved, but very disruptively. One member of an IWW campaign at a restaurant recalls that a self-identified anarchist coworker was the most disruptive committee member. He would scream at coworkers for doing the wrong thing, and when asked to debrief after one such incident, simply quit the union and bad-mouthed them behind their backs.
Other campaign members recall leftists pulling radical stunts out of line with their coworkers’ planning — in fact there is a whole section of the IWW Organizer Training 102 about what to do with coworkers who aren’t accountable to the committee. Perhaps thinking that they know it all, leftists sometimes seem least capable of collaborating with their coworkers. One organizer for a mainstream union who is also in the IWW notes that a common pattern with leftists is to “Always, always see political or strategic differences of opinion as very personal, and as a personal attack.”
Refusing to talk to coworkers
By far the most common pattern we see, however, is leftists unwilling or unable to reach out and talk to their coworkers in what we call a “one-on-one.” Granted, this is a scary prospect for a lot of workers, but it genuinely seems to be more of a roadblock for leftists.
One organizer in the rustbelt recalls when a dozen members of the DSA approached her about organizing their workplace, a tech company. She met with them as a staffer for the mainstream union she works for. “They formed a committee,” she recalls. “It was only the lefties. I said, ‘you have to start having one-on-ones.’ They were very skittish about that.”
A few attended the IWW Organizer Training 101, which breaks down each of the steps involved in talking to coworkers — inviting them to chat outside of work, asking them questions about their issues — confronting all of the awkwardness and pitfalls head-on through roleplay and group discussion. But still, the DSA members did not approach their coworkers.
“After that we all met with the Director of Organizing,” the organizer says. “We did some workplace mapping, and told them next steps: gather a list. Start at least building relationships with coworkers. Just go talk to people, become friends. It will become easier as you do it.”
With nothing left to do but start having one-on-ones, “all of them dropped off the face of the earth. They stopped organizing. They said ‘Yeah we’re scared. We kind of like our bosses.’” The staffers pointed out that their company had just been bought by a multinational which was already making cuts to benefits. “We were like, ‘guys, you have to talk to your coworkers.’ They just wouldn’t.”
Instead, the DSA members did something many leftists do these days: they skipped over their own workplace and sought out activism that wouldn’t involve one-on-ones or confronting the boss. They organized a large fundraiser for a nonprofit called Justice is Global.
The organizer went, at their invitation. “It was crazy. There were twenty people there, and almost everyone was from their workplace. They would have doubled the committee size if they had just talked to the people in that room about a union.”
“They were like, ‘We need to reach out to other workers in the world.’ Have you reached out to your own coworkers?” [The multinational company they work for] is one of the biggest companies in the world. That’s an avenue to reach out to other workers right there. You have the perfect way to do it: through a union.”
This has become a pattern. Leftists are much more comfortable reaching out to other radicals, or engaging in activism — including to help poor, downtrodden workers elsewhere — than they are organizing their own workplaces. Leftists will pump out social media about a general strike and call for the working class to rise up, but decline to have that same conversation with the people they work with.
Militancy where you’d least expect it
Meanwhile, consider some inverse examples.
During an IWW campaign in Chicago, Steve, a former sheet metal worker, refused to support the union when approached about it. Years prior, he was run out of his job by both the bosses and the union and his concept of what a “union” meant had been colored by an ugly history. Had the IWW campaign involved a union election, he probably would have been a “no” vote — a “5” in the 1-5 business union organizer’s assessment of support. But when it came to shopfloor action, he emerged at the front of the fight. The union carefully built towards a work stoppage to win higher pay, and Steve led the charge, and even accepted a position as one of two representatives of the workers in bargaining with management.
One of the faculty campaign organizers mentioned above reflects that in one campaign among adjuncts, “the worker-leaders, those who were most actively engaged in forming the union early on, were in the business department, the criminal justice department, and some of them were politically conservative.”
The most capable, militant fighters who emerge in a given campaign are often people who had zero leftist commitments prior, or even any previous union experience. There’s a natural reason for this: folks are fighting from the heart, for what really matters to them and their family. Their motivation doesn’t come from abstract politics, as is the case for some leftists.
When the IWW’s Stardust campaign — the biggest in the union’s recent history — took off, an organizer friend of ours mused that the reason was because there were no leftists involved. Instead, ordinary workers were taking on the boss about specific issues in the workplace, doing sit-down strikes, work refusals and walk-outs, and winning. This continues to be the case, as unexpected people step up on a given issue — one they care about a lot — and lead the charge.
Likewise, when “the ranks” rise up in a mainstream union, the militants who emerge are often ordinary people who just care about the issues — not the card-carrying leftists, who themselves can just as easily hold the struggle back (see “The Leftwing Committeeman” from Martin Glaberman’s Punching Out).
Why is it this way?
Why are so many leftists so dedicated to unions in their minds yet such poor union members in the world outside of their mind?
Political ideology is, for many people, an identity, not a set of practical commitments. Anyone who hangs out primarily in subcultural spaces, leftist or otherwise, is going to have a tougher time being comfortable around “normies.” Worse still, ideology can serve as a comfortable way to mask fears. If you can refuse to participate on political grounds, it’s a lot easier than acknowledging that you’re scared of losing your job, just like your liberal and conservative coworkers.
But fortunately we’re not aiming to organize leftists, we are here to organize the working class.
What workers think and say about “unions” does not reflect how they will behave when an organized fight breaks out with their boss. As we can see above, workers who are consciously committed to the labor movement will mysteriously stop returning phone calls. Workers who might never speak favorably of unions will risk everything in a work stoppage to hold their head up high next to their coworkers.
Whatever the explanation for this phenomenon is, the correlation is too strong to ignore. If you’re going to heed the lesson, not only do you stop steering towards lefty coworkers, you might even swerve to avoid them altogether.

","HOUSTON — There was no question on primary night in Texas last month that Franklin Bynum would win the Democratic nomination to become a criminal court judge in Houston. The 34-year-old defense attorney had no challengers.
But for his supporters who packed into a Mexican restaurant that evening, there was still something impressive to celebrate. Many in the crowd were members of the Democratic Socialists of America, or D.S.A., a group that has experienced an enormous surge of interest since the election of President Trump, even in conservative states. And Mr. Bynum was one of their own — a socialist who, along with at least 16 others, appeared on the ballot in primary races across the state of Texas.
“Yes, I’m running as a socialist,” Mr. Bynum said. “I’m a far-left candidate. What I’m trying to do is be a Democrat who actually stands for something, and tells people, ‘Here’s how we are going to materially improve conditions in your life.’”
Rather than shy away from being called a socialist, a word conservatives have long wielded as a slur, candidates like Mr. Bynum are embracing the label. He is among dozens of D.S.A. members running in this fall’s midterms for offices across the country at nearly every level. In Hawaii, Kaniela Ing, a state representative, is running for Congress. Gayle McLaughlin, a former mayor of Richmond, Calif., is running to be the state’s lieutenant governor. In Tennessee, Dennis Prater, an adjunct professor at East Tennessee State University, is running to be a county commissioner."

","Defying widespread popular objection, on December 14 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to repeal net neutrality. The principle regulates broadband as a utility, thus forbidding cable companies and Internet service providers (ISPs) from throttling, blocking or otherwise discriminating against online traffic. While net neutrality was only enacted in early 2015, it swiftly proved a key component of an open Internet.
Private network providers prioritize only those they expect to provide a return on investment, thus excluding poor and sparsely populated areas.
While the assault on net neutrality is formidable, it’s not without formal opposition. The Republican-helmed FCC’s two Democrat Commissioners, Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel, have censured the decision and urged dissent. A number of state attorneys general — including those in New York, California, and Illinois — have vowed to sue the FCC over the ruling. Congressional Democrats, shepherded by Mass. Sen. Ed Markey, plan to file legislation to reverse the repeal.
Relying on such reactive regulatory appeals to herald the fight for a fair Internet, however, won’t guarantee one. The FCC’s revocation of net neutrality isn’t a call to merely restore the technocratic 2015 rules, but to reclaim the Internet as a public good to which all have the right to access.
The Internet was initially a product of public spending. The U.S. Defense Department first conceived it in the 1960s, following a period of feverish technological competition with the Soviet Union. By the early 1990s, the government ceded control of the Internet to the private sector, which had the putative capacity to host its rapid growth. Since then, the transition to corporate stewardship has stratified the digital landscape and isolated disenfranchised populations.
Consider the monopolization of ISPs. Because different network providers, such as AT&T and Comcast, sell broadband to discrete geographic regions with little overlap, they have immense power to manipulate speeds and charge prohibitively expensive rates. Comcast, the nation’s largest private broadband provider, is notorious for overcharging its users and stifling speeds. Users and politicians alike echo these concerns for other ISPs on a seemingly regular basis, rendering the telecom industry one of the country’s most reviled.
Such profiteering tactics have disproportionately affected low-income and rural communities. ISPs have long redlined these demographic groups, creating what’s commonly known as the ​“digital divide.” Thirty-nine percent of Americans lack access to service fast enough to meet the federal definition of broadband. More than 50 percent of adults with household incomes below $30,000 have home broadband — a problem plaguing users of color most acutely. In contrast, internet access is near-universal for households with an annual income of $100,000 or more.
The reason for such chasms is simple: Private network providers prioritize only those they expect to provide a return on investment, thus excluding poor and sparsely populated areas.
Previously, the government has intervened, requiring telecoms to proffer discounted service to low-income areas. These initiatives, however, have fallen short. In 2016, AT&T introduced low-cost regional broadband for Federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) users, an FCC-mandated condition of its merger with DirecTV. To receive the service, users had to live in neighborhoods that could accommodate a minimum speed of three megabits per second (Mbps). The significant number of people whose addresses didn’t meet that criteria, meanwhile, were forced to either pay full price or forego access. (The National Digital Inclusion Alliance detailed the company’s egregious redlining of impoverished communities in Cleveland.)
Chattanooga, Tenn. has seen more success in addressing redlining. Since 2010, the city has offered public broadband via its municipal power organization, Electric Power Board (EPB). The project has become a rousing success: At half the price, its service is approximately 85 percent faster than that of Comcast, the region’s primary ISP prior to EPB’s inception. Coupled with a discounted program for low-income residents, Chattanooga’s publicly run broadband reaches about 82,000 residents — more than half of the area’s Internet users — and is only expected to grow.
Chattanooga’s achievements have radiated to other locales. More than 450 communities have introduced publicly-owned broadband. And more than 110 communities in 24 states have access to publicly owned networks with one gigabit-per-second (Gbps) service. (AT&T, for example, has yet to introduce speeds this high.) Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant proposed a pilot project in 2015 and has recently urged her city to invest in municipal broadband. Hawaii congressperson Kaniela Ing is drafting a bill for publicly-owned Internet for the state legislature to consider next year. In November, residents of Fort Collins, Colo. voted to authorize the city to build municipal broadband infrastructure.
The Fort Collins vote reveals a widening aperture between public needs and corporate ISPs’ interests. The state of Colorado—among others—prohibits cities from building municipal broadband infrastructure. In many cases, such prohibitions can be traced to telecom-sponsored legislators. Yet in Colorado, 31 counties have protested the strictures such lobbying has produced, and it’s likely that other state residents, if given the opportunity to weigh in, won’t be far behind.
City-operated networks have the power to increase speeds, decrease costs and broaden availability. Yet restoring public broadband ownership can’t be a piecemeal municipal effort, as hordes of communities will continue to be neglected. Rather, public ownership must be won on a national level to eradicate ISP lobbying and monopolies, and corporate ISPs themselves, thus guaranteeing universal access.
The potential absence of net neutrality is simply a symptom of an unfettered free market — the corollary to decades of privatized network providers’ free rein to overcharge and underserve. Advocating for the preservation of net neutrality is necessary, but it won’t suffice if equitable internet access is to be achieved. Under such high stakes, it’s time to regain the digital infrastructure that could have — and always should have — been ours."

President Donald Trump’s administration has sped up a process that will hand over the rights to a sacred Apache Indigenous area outside of Phoenix, Arizona, to a mining company by next month—a full year ahead of schedule.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to release its official environmental impact statement that will give the go-ahead to transfer Oak Flat in the Tonto National Forest to the mining company Resolution Copper, a joint venture by mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP, a year before its planned December 2021 date.

The announcement came just days after the Trump administration issued an executive order that declared the U.S. dependence on China for “critical minerals” a national emergency and vowed to “cut down on unnecessary delays in permitting actions.”
Some see the expedited process to mine the Oak Flat as part of a final push to weaken environmental regulations and fulfill Trump’s campaign promise to bring back mining jobs from abroad.
“They are afraid of what a (Joe) Biden administration would do and so they want to get this done now,” Randy Serraglio, who works at the Arizona-based Center for Biological Diversity, said.
Once the Environmental Impact Statement is released, Tonto National Forest will have at most 60 days to finish the land exchange, but critics think it will try and execute as fast as possible to avoid litigation and public opposition.
Democratic Arizona representative Raúl Grijalva and Senator Bernie Sanders have introduced a bill calling for the land transfer to be repealed. “If the land exchange happens, it will be difficult to roll back,” Grijalva told the Guardian.
“The Trump administration is cutting corners and doing a rushed job just to take care of Rio Tinto,” he said. “And the fact they are doing it during COVID makes it even more disgusting. Trump and Rio Tinto know the tribes’ reaction would be very strong and public under normal circumstances but the tribes are trying to save their people right now.”
The desertous and otherworldly Oak Flat is located in the outskirts of the San Carlos Apache reservation, and has been a highly contested area for more than two decades. In 1995, enormous copper deposits were found 7,000 feet, or five Eiffel Towers, beneath the ground. Resolution Copper hopes to extract 1.4 billion tons of ore and 40 billion pounds of copper cliff by using a technique called panel caving, which could likely cause the collapse of surrounding land and leave a giant crater once the company is finished mining.
Local Indigenous communities are worried about the destruction of the land, particularly Apache Leap, the site of a mass suicide in which warriors jumped off to escape an onslaught of U.S. soldiers in the 1870s. On top of that, the area is also considered to have the best-preserved artifacts of Apache culture and is the location of Sunrise coming-of-age ceremonies.

“I tell people that it’s no different than when people talk about the Holy Land,” Wendsler Nosie Sr., an Apache activist, told VICE News. “This place is a place where you can be born and die of old age because it has everything… It’s a provider for all.”
In an email, Dan Blondeau, a spokesperson for Resolution Copper, ensured that Resolution Copper was going to protect Apache Leap and that it was “partnering with consulting Western Apache tribes… (to) protect and conserve culturally significant Emory Oak groves.”
But Native opposition against the mine is strong and Nosie Sr., who lives in Oak Flat, said that the company feels “no responsibility to talk to the tribes.” He also says it hasn’t spoken to him or others he knows about some of Apache’s spiritual concerns.
In 2012, a Senate hearing addressed the issue of the Apache peoples’ fight against Resolution Copper.
“Senator (Jon) Kyl and I (are constantly) urging that the San Carlos Apache Tribe just sit down, just listen to the Resolution Copper,” Senator John McCain said. “They refuse to do it.”
Two years later, McCain pushed for the land transfer to Rio Tinto, through one of his infamous “midnight rider” maneuvers. Although the Obama administration protected the Oak Flats through a “Historic Places” designation in 2015, this does not override the 1872 General Mining Law, which includes a provision that favors industry over environmental concerns when it comes to mining.

Despite Resolution Copper’s promise that it will bring great economic benefits to the Apache community and that it is working with locals to ensure it respects sacred land, the Guardian reported that Rio Tinto destroyed an ancient Aboriginal site in Western Australia earlier this year even after it claimed it had been working with Native people for decades.
“We deeply regret the events at Juukan Gorge and have unreservedly apologised to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people,” the company wrote in a public statement.
In its final year in power, Trump has green-lit similar projects that were deemed detrimental to the environment by past administrations. In Alaska, the Trump administration is hastening the auctioning off of drilling rights in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. In Minnesota, officials renewed mineral leases to a copper mining company inside the Superior National Forest.
Aside from its cultural and spiritual significance, Oak Flat is known as a place of awesome natural splendor and is home to endangered ocelots, the charismatic hedgehog cactus, and its namesake tree, the Emory oak.
Some locals believe that the only hope to save the natural area now would be a major legal intervention by the next administration.
“Joe Biden can thank Native people, 90 percent of whom voted for him, for winning Arizona,” Serraglio said. “I hope he can recognize that and do the right thing.”

","Sanders’ team has long pointed out that he narrowly won young black voters in 2016. “The senator has trouble with older voters across the board. Millennials love him the most,” said Nina Turner, a Sanders campaign co-chair. She added that in regards to African-American outreach, “We’ve been working really hard. We’re going to continue to do so.""
But younger black voters cast ballots at much lower rates than their older counterparts. This year, there is little exit poll data on black voters under 30. One exception is South Carolina, where exit polling found that Sanders defeated Biden among black voters under 30 in the state by a small margin, 38-36. But they only accounted for 6 percent of the electorate.
Sanders also bested Biden 41-29 among black voters under 30 in Texas — who comprised 2 percent of the electorate. But young voters haven’t turned out in the numbers Sanders’ campaign had hoped, putting the senator’s promise of an expanded electorate out of reach.
Polls have shown that older voters and people of color are more concerned with so-called “electability” than others, and recent surveys have found that voters see Biden as more able to defeat Trump than Sanders.
LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, whose policies align with Sanders, said the Vermont senator’s “strong economic analysis resonates particularly with the black activist class.” But she doesn’t think Sanders understands that racism is as “central and key to our condition as the economic issues. Sometimes I feel like he doesn’t see that.”
“There's a blind spot as it relates to race,” said Brown, who previously endorsed Warren and has no plans at this time to back another candidate. “Bernie has not publicly expressed that he even thinks that he needs black voters.”
Brown was bothered by a recent interview Sanders gave to MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. When pressed on his lack of support among black voters across the board, Sanders pinned it on Biden’s connection to former President Barack Obama, and claimed that in 2016 Bill Clinton’s popularity with black voters helped Hillary Clinton.
Brown praised the work of Sanders’ surrogates Turner, Agnew and Cornel West, but asked: “Where is the concerted effort and message that can actually bring in the masses of black people? I'm not seeing it, something is not resonating.”
Sanders also drew media attention after deciding not to deliver his original speech on race in Flint in favor of giving the mic to black leaders at his roundtable to talk about issues such as reparations, though he did speak himself late in the program about the wealth gap between white and black Americans, as well as the maternal mortality rate among black women.
Some of Sanders’ allies were miffed by the narrative that emerged from the event, which focused on Sanders’ scrapped speech rather than the voices of the black leaders and surrogates present who talked about their experiences with racial and economic injustice. “As black folks, we have been fighting for our entire lives to be positioned in a way in which we get to tell our stories,” said Jennifer Epps-Addison, president of the pro-Sanders Center for Popular Democracy and a member of the panel that night.
Likewise, Sanders’ decision to cancel a Mississippi event and skip the commemoration of Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama raised eyebrows among some black activists and Democratic Party leaders.
“While it may seem like it’s a small state or regional event, [it] projects out to the larger African-American community,” said Andrew Gillum, a progressive star in Florida who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2018 with Sanders’ backing. “It’s those kinds of things that candidates have to be very conscious of their participation. Black people watch for those signals from these candidates.”
Turner said Sanders attended the prior two Bloody Selma commemorations, and that he “is very committed to the civil rights movement” and “was a part of that movement as a young Jewish man.” Sanders held an event in Los Angeles, California, that day.

Gillum said Sanders’ campaign would benefit from bringing in more black surrogate voices, or working to get different endorsers on the trail and making the rounds on cable television. “These campaigns have to constantly be signaling growth.”
Detroit, the most populous city in Michigan, will be the test of Sanders’ newly focused outreach to black voters, said Gillum. Last week, Sanders performed better among black voters in states outside the South. In Minnesota, for instance, Biden narrowly beat him among black voters, 47 percent to 43 percent — by comparison, Sanders lost black voters by 44 percentage points in South Carolina, according to exit polls.
“Sanders won Michigan in 2016 but lost the black vote to Hillary Clinton by 40 points,” said Theodore Johnson, a senior fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice whose research covers racial identity in electoral politics. “Nothing he's done since then suggests he can improve on that margin against Biden, especially with recent polls showing Sanders down by at least 15 points.”
“The Jesse Jackson endorsement and the Cornel West appearances are unlikely to move the needle much — there's simply no moment waiting for Sanders in Michigan that will do for him what [House Majority Whip Jim] Clyburn did for Biden in South Carolina,” said Johnson.
Sanders’ underperformance with black voters to date isn’t a complete surprise for Virgie Rollins, the chair of the Democratic National Committee’s black caucus and a political player in Detroit who hosted Sanders at her house before his narrow primary win there in 2016.
This time, Rollins is hosting Biden. Sanders, she said, is less relatable.
“I hosted Bernie Sanders, and he won Michigan,” Rollins said. “I hosted Barack Obama, and he became president. I hosted Bill Clinton, and he became president. And [now] I’m hosting Joe Biden.”

","'It's Time To Get Something Back': Union Workers' Voices Are Getting Louder
Enlarge this image toggle caption Bill Pugliano/Getty Images Bill Pugliano/Getty Images
As autoworkers at General Motors plants around the country vote this week on whether to accept a new contract, workers elsewhere see an opportunity to demand their own chance in the driver's seat.
The U.S. is enjoying a record-long economic boom, but workers' slice of the pie has barely increased. After decades of relative silence, newly emboldened workers are increasingly vocal in demanding higher pay and better working conditions.
""We have given enough. It's time to get something back,"" declared Stacy Davis-Gates, vice president of the 25,000-member Chicago Teachers Union, which has been on strike since last Thursday.
Over the last two years, hundreds of thousands of teachers, nurses and factory workers have walked off the job. Last year, more workers went on strike than at any time since 1986.
""Working people have taken it on the chin for four decades,"" said Lawrence Mishel, a labor economist with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute in Washington. ""The workforce has been a tinderbox waiting to be lit. And if people see a way that they can solve their problems for themselves and their communities, they're going to take it.""
In the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, it was routine to see hundreds of big strikes every year, idling a million workers or more. But in recent decades, work stoppages like the one at GM have been much less common. A turning point came in 1981, when President Reagan fired thousands of striking air traffic controllers.
Although Reagan was careful to distinguish the illegal controllers' strike from lawful walkouts by private-sector workers, many private employers followed his example, firing strikers in the years that followed. With unemployment topping 10% in the early 1980s, replacement workers were not hard to come by.
Since then, the share of workers who are unionized has been cut by half, to just over 10% last year. Union membership in the private sector is less than 7%.
""Strikes bottomed out because the employers were using an unbelievably strong weapon and because the labor market allowed them to find people who were willing to cross a union picket line to take the job of a union worker who was out on strike,"" said John Beck, a labor relations expert at Michigan State University.
Today, with unemployment near a 50-year low, there's less danger that striking workers can be quickly replaced. Employees at GM and elsewhere are asking themselves, ""If not now, when?""
""You've got really an economy that says to many workers, 'This is the time for us to grab what we can,' "" Beck said.
Teachers have been leading the charge, walking out of classrooms from Arizona to Oklahoma and West Virginia to protest wages that have lost ground to inflation.
Nurses have also been active on the picket lines. Like teachers, their jobs are not easily shipped overseas.
""We can't continue to work off the clock, work without breaks, work without a lunch,"" said Deborah Burger, a president of National Nurses United, which led one-day walkouts last month at hospitals in several states. ""We're trying to raise the awareness of the community. They understand that, and they support us.""
Public approval of organized labor is near its highest level in 50 years, a recent Gallup poll found. A separate survey found nearly half of all non-union workers would join a union if they could.
Still, any big rebound in union membership is unlikely, given the legal and cultural roadblocks.
""It's very difficult to organize new members,"" said Arthur Wheaton of the Industrial and Labor Relations school at Cornell University. ""A lot of companies are hiring what they call 'union avoidance' law firms. And winning an election and getting the first contract negotiated is extremely difficult.""
Twenty-seven states — including union strongholds like Michigan — now have ""right to work"" laws, which make union membership and dues-paying optional. Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that government workers who choose not to join a union can't be forced to pay a collective bargaining fee.
Some unions are now devoting more attention to improving pay and benefits for workers who aren't union members, campaigning, for example, for a higher minimum wage.
If the UAW strike results in better pay for autoworkers, employees in other industries may be encouraged to test their own bargaining power.
""People don't revolt when things are at their worst,"" Beck said. ""They revolt when things are getting better but not fast enough."""

","WATCH: UAW Local 1005 Chairman Al Tiller on a union member's kid whose cancer treatment was cancelled cuz GM cut off their healthcare in retaliation for striking pic.twitter.com/cg5qTuFwu0 — Mike Elk (@MikeElk) September 18, 2019
CLEVELAND – Yesterday, General Motors made the unexpected decision to cut off healthcare to employees out on strike. In previous strikes, GM had never done this. However, GM is playing hardball now.
The result of them cutting off health insurance is that UAW members and their families with chronic health conditions are being denied care.
In Parma, Ohio, one UAW member’s kid couldn’t even get cancer treatment as a result of GM’s tactic. Many union leaders worry that someone may die as a result of GM’s decision as people put off doctor’s visits.
Watch UAW Local 1005 Chairman Al Tiller talk about how one member’s kid was unable to get cancer treatment.
However, GM’s hardball tactics are increasing the resolve of workers to soldier on as they are angry about GM’s callous actions.
“They are trying their best to break us, but what they don’t realize is that the more they push, they thought they were gonna divide and conquer the more we are uniting,” says Al Tiller.

demsocialist,"https://www.texastribune.org/2018/12/17/what-medicaid-coverage-gap-means-texans-without-health-insurance/
","In 2012, Tanya Walker took the $200 her father loaned her to see a doctor. She was in the aftermath of a divorce and needed a prescription for antidepressants, she said. But her doctor in Texarkana found signs of hypertension and prediabetes — problems Walker knew she could not afford to have.
Although her five kids were covered under Medicaid, Walker was ineligible for the state program and had no health insurance.
Walker fell into the uncertain terrain of the health care coverage gap — she earned too much from her part-time job at a local Walmart to qualify for Medicaid, but too little to qualify for tax credits for private insurance under the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.
Under Obamacare, Medicaid — the joint state-federal program that provides health care to low-income individuals — was intended to fill that gap by expanding to cover individuals who earn up to about 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $34,638 a year for a family of four. A recent ruling from a federal judge in Texas invalidated Obamacare, throwing the whole program into question; for now, the sweeping law remains in effect.
First, individual states had to agree to expand their Medicaid program, and the federal government offered to pay for 100 percent of states' Medicaid expansion from 2014 to 2016 — aid that decreased to 90 percent by 2020.
But a number of states, including Texas, fought the Obama administration’s mandate to expand Medicaid, and in 2012 the Supreme Court ruled states were not required to comply with the mandate. That left about 638,000 non-elderly Texans in the Medicaid gap as of 2016 — the most among the states that didn’t expand Medicaid, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
“When the Supreme Court decision came down, people who were in that kind of middle-income band, they still had access to the subsidies through the marketplace,” said Rachel Garfield, associate director of the foundation’s Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured. “It was people at the lower end of the spectrum who were left without that coverage option.”
People like Walker.
Even after she got a job as a substitute teacher that paid around $800 per month — and offered health insurance through the school district — she still didn’t earn enough to pay the almost $1,000 a month for coverage. In Texas, substitute teachers don’t receive the same level of state contribution for health insurance as full-time teachers, said Amy Nix, director of human resources for Texarkana Independent School District.
Walker, 51, said Texas’ decision not to expand Medicaid under Obamacare left vulnerable Texans with few options for health care.
“It felt like in Charles Dickens’ Christmas Carol when Scrooge says, ‘Let them die and reduce the surplus population,’ ” Walker said. “That’s how I felt other Texans and my legislators felt about the working poor, ‘If you can’t afford insurance then we don’t care about you.’”
Many states, including Virginia and Louisiana, have since changed course and expanded Medicaid, while in other states — like Idaho, Nebraska and Utah — voters have bypassed their elected leaders to approve Medicaid expansion in recent elections. But Texas leaders haven’t budged on the issue and the state remains one of 14 with a coverage gap.
“Medicaid expansion is wrong for Texas,” Gov. Greg Abbott said during a 2015 press conference in which he called Obamacare a ""massive expansion of an already broken and bloated Medicaid program.”

Kids on Medicaid, parents not
To examine the role state and local policy play in issues related to income inequality such as health care, the Tribune collaborated with news outlets in Georgia, New York and Washington state.
New York and Washington state both expanded Medicaid, and their rates of uninsured citizens — 6 percent and 7 percent, respectively — have fallen below the 2016 national average of 9 percent, according to Kaiser Family Foundation. Texas and Georgia, both non-expansion states, had uninsured rates exceeding the national average, by 6 and 3 percent respectively, in 2016.
Advocates and experts say if the state were to expand Medicaid, the coverage gap would disappear and more than a million uninsured Texans would obtain health coverage. Like Walker, many of them are the parents of children who qualify for Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program based on their parents’ income, said Anne Dunkelberg, program director for the health and wellness team at the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities.
“Many [legislators] have incorrectly believed that the parents of our kids on Medicaid get Medicaid too. They don’t,” Dunkelberg said. “We have about 3.2 million children on Medicaid on any given day, and only about 150,000 parents.”
Although about 64 percent of Texans favor expanding Medicaid, the main support comes from Democrats — 82 percent approve — while 59 percent of Texas Republicans prefer keeping the state’s current Medicaid program, according to a recent survey from the Episcopal Health Foundation and the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Walker said her opinion on health care has been influenced by her personal experiences “trying to make ends meet and trying to stay healthy.”
“Generally I’m very conservative in my politics,” Walker said. “But I’d really like to see Medicaid expanded and health care changed completely in all states, everywhere.”
The gap’s origins in Texas
Texas has “one of the most restrictive Medicaid systems in the country,” said Tiffany Hogue, policy director for the Texas Organizing Project, a state nonprofit that advocates for low-income and working families.
In Texas, adults who have children can receive Medicaid, but can’t make more than about 18 percent of the federal poverty level. According to Texas Health and Human Services Commission, a family of four can only make up to about $285 per month for parents to qualify for Medicaid. Adults without children can’t qualify for Medicaid unless they are disabled or pregnant and meet specific income thresholds.
In other non-expansion states like Georgia and Oklahoma, adults with children can make up to 36 percent and 45 percent of the federal poverty level and qualify for Medicaid.
“The parents that you do have in that tiny slice [that receive Medicaid in Texas], they are desperately poor,” Dunkelberg said. “They’re like people living with their parents or in a homeless shelter. Three hundred dollars a month, you can’t live on that.”
Alisha Brummett, a 43-year-old mother of five from Katy, said before her husband found a job as a middle school choir teacher, the couple lived for about two years in the coverage gap. While her husband was attending school full time and working a part-time job, the family earned about $12,000 a year, Brummett said.
For her, living in the gap meant looking for alternatives to traditional health care.
“We got used to doing everything naturally, like with food or essential oils because we knew we couldn’t go to the doctor,” Brummett said. “We knew we didn’t have that option because it’s so crazy expensive.”
Emergency rooms get flooded
Hogue said expanding Medicaid would save taxpayer money that’s being spent treating uninsured people who turn to hospital emergency rooms for health care — often when they have a full-blown health crisis.
Under federal law, emergency rooms cannot turn away an individual based on their ability to pay, and about 17 percent of uninsured adults say the emergency room was their “usual source of care” in 2014, which was “substantially higher than adults with private insurance,” according to a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation.
“That’s the most expensive and most inefficient use of our tax dollars,” Hogue said. “If people are using the emergency room as their only health care, that raises the cost for people who have insurance, for our public safety networks. When we don’t create an alternative, we’re costing the whole state a whole lot more money.”
Parkland Hospital in Dallas provided about $880 million in uncompensated care in fiscal year 2017 — $100 million more than in 2013 — according to Fred Cerise, president and CEO of Parkland Health and Hospital System. He said most of the patients the hospital treated who couldn’t afford care came from outside of Dallas County.
“We know we have pent-up demand in some areas and [Medicaid expansion] would allow us to see more patients,” Cerise said. “For counties that don’t have a Parkland, it would allow greater access to care as well. Plus, it would free up some Dallas County tax dollars.”
The federal government reimburses hospitals and other health providers for some of their uncompensated care costs through what is known as the Texas 1115 Transformation Waiver, but the waiver is set to expire in 2022 and it’s unclear whether it will be extended.
People in the coverage gap can also seek care at federally qualified health centers — better known as community health centers — which are primarily funded through Medicaid and federal grants.
Most community health centers offer primary care to uninsured individuals and charge patients based on their ability to pay, which protects people in the coverage gap from spending astronomical amounts when their medical needs become severe, said Mimi Garcia, director of policy and external communications for the Texas Association of Community Health Centers.
In Texas, about 75 community health centers serve 126 of the state’s 254 counties, and about 1.4 million patients annually, according to the association. Nationally, almost a quarter of community health center patients were uninsured in 2016, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
At Los Barrios Unidos Community Clinic, a federally qualified health center with locations in Oak Cliff and West Dallas, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Sharon Davis said they have to refer patients to other places, such as Parkland, if they need surgery or care from a specialist, and for those patients the waits can be lengthy.
“For me I really always believe that health care is a right of every individual and I believe there’s too many places where that doesn’t exist,” Davis said. “I don’t like to be in a position where I have to ration out care. People don’t understand the tough decisions that I see some of our [patients] making. They might have four children and they’re all sick, but they have to sit and think, ‘Which of my children do I want to be seen?’”
‘Dead on arrival’
For years, Texas Democrats have filed legislation to expand Medicaid, but those measures have gone nowhere in the Republican-dominated Legislature.
Hogue said she remembers lobbying with the Texas Organizing Project for Medicaid expansion at the Capitol during the 2013 legislative session. It was “dead on arrival” without support from Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, she said.
Even though other Republican-led states have expanded Medicaid, state Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, said he doesn’t expect Abbott or Patrick to change their minds on expanding Medicaid.
“It’s not that it can’t be done in the state,” he said. “There has to be the will to do it, and so the will unfortunately is not there.”
State Rep. John Zerwas, R-Richmond, said for members of his party, Medicaid expansion is a non-starter because of the threat it could pose to their political reputation.
“I just don't think there’s an appetite among the Republican-led Senate and House,” he said. “There’s still a lot of stigma around expanding what is seen as a consuming program.”
In 2013, Zerwas authored HB 3791, known as the “Texas Solution,” which he said would have brought private marketplace principles to the state’s Medicaid program and given individuals incentives to live healthier lifestyles. The legislation would have allowed the state to receive federal money in the form of block grants to enroll individuals in a private health plan using a sliding scale subsidy, rather than expanding Medicaid to cover them.
The bill garnered some bipartisan support in the House, with Coleman signing on as a co-author. However, it gained little traction among Republican hardliners and never reached the House floor for a vote.
“They said, ‘No, I can’t support it. It looks too much like Obamacare,’ and that will kill me in my primary [election],’” Zerwas said.
But health care emerged as a major campaign focus for many of those same lawmakers during this year’s midterm elections.
Bob Stein, a political science professor at Rice University who researches voting behavior and elections, said health care and immigration topped voters’ list of concerns when they went to the polls in November.
Stein said Republican county commissioners — who hear complaints from voters as their taxes rise to help pay for the public hospitals that serve people who can’t get Medicaid — could force more dialogue about Medicaid expansion. At Parkland, for example, about one third of the hospital’s funding comes from Dallas County taxpayers.
The cost of caring for people without Medicaid “all goes on the local county taxpayers,” Stein said. “What’s happened in the last few years is that Republican county elected officials, like in Harris County, in Dallas and in Fort Bend, have been asking the state to adopt Medicaid extension … that I think is one of those issues voters don’t know about.”
Rep. Carol Alvarado, D-Houston, who has already filed a bill that would allow county commissioners to request a federal waiver to expand Medicaid within their jurisdictions, said she thinks there’s support among county elected officials to expand Medicaid on a county-by-county basis.
“I think there are other counties throughout Texas that want to do this, but the state has been basically holding them hostage,” she said.
Walker didn’t wait for Texas to improve health care for its low-income citizens. After spending two years earning her associates degree in nursing, Walker now works as a nurse at Kansas Heart Hospital in Wichita, Kansas, and receives insurance through her employer.
“It took me some [time] to get used to,” Walker said. “It’s like, ‘Oh yeah, I don’t feel good. I can go to the doctor and it’s not going to put me in debt.’”

","Do three Americans really have more wealth than half the country?
It’s a claim made by the runner-up for the 2016 Democratic nomination for president, Bernie Sanders.
Campaigning on July 14, 2018 for U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., Sanders told a crowd in Eau Claire:
""The three wealthiest people"" own ""more wealth than the bottom half of the American people.""
The U.S. senator, an independent from Vermont, previously made the claim on Facebook and repeated it three days after his Wisconsin appearance in a column in USA Today.
What we found is the wealth lead enjoyed by the three billionaires is even larger than what Sanders said.
A study
Before we dig in, an important note about the nation’s wealth gap:
Many Americans make a good income, have some savings and investments, and own a nice home; they also have debt, for a mortgage, credit cards and other bills. The result is, even some people with relatively healthy incomes, as well as many poorer people, have a negative net worth.
To back Sanders’ claim, his campaign pointed us to a November 2017 news article in Forbes. The business magazine reported on a study published that month by the Institute for Policy Studies, which the article described as a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C.
The study, which advocates for reducing wealth inequality, also gained news coverage from USA Today and The Guardian. And its authors wrote opinion articles about it for Newsweek and the Los Angeles Times.
The numbers
The study used data from Forbes’ 2017 ranking of the 400 richest Americans; and data for the rest of the country from the 2016 Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances, which the study says has become widely accepted as the most comprehensive government dataset documenting household wealth. PolitiFact has also relied on this Fed survey in our wealth fact checks.
The first finding the study reported was this:
The three wealthiest people in the United States now own more wealth than the entire bottom half of the American population combined, a total of 160 million people.
Those individuals and their source of wealth are, according to the study:
1. Bill Gates, Microsoft: $89 billion
2. Jeff Bezos, Amazon: $81.5 billion
3. Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway: $78 billion
That’s a total of $248.5 billion. The wealth of the bottom 160 million was $245 billion, the Institute for Policy Studies' Josh Hoxie told us. That’s a gap of $3.5 billion.
Hoxie, a former a aide to Sanders, also pointed out that the wealth of the three billionaires has ballooned to $330 billion, according to Forbes’ latest estimate.
We don’t have an updated estimate for the bottom 160 million American, as the Fed survey is done only once every three years. But Hoxie said it’s nearly impossible that the wealth of Americans at the bottom has grown nearly as much as that of the three billionaires.
For the 160 million people at the bottom of the scale, by the way, the study used the net worth figure reported by the Fed and then subtracted automobiles and other ""durable goods"" such as electronics, furniture, and household appliances, from that figure.
Subtracting durable goods from net worth ""offers us a more accurate depiction of household wealth as these items are not easily sellable and neither appreciate nor hold constant their value,"" the study says.
Other viewpoints
More fact checks on wealth inequality Michael Moore, in 2011: ""Just 400 Americans -- 400 -- have more wealth than half of all Americans combined."" True. One Wisconsin Now, in 2013: ""The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined."" True. Starbucks, in 2015: ""White people control almost 90 percent of the nation's wealth."" True.
The study’s methodology is sound and its conclusion cited by Sanders is accurate, according to Abdur Chowdhury, an emeritus economics professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee, and economics professor Emmanuel Saez, director of the Center for Equitable Growth at the University of California, Berkeley.
As an aside, we’ll note that Saez also said Sanders’ claim is ""somewhat meaningless.""
""The meaningful thing to say,"" Saez told us, ""is the bottom half of the U.S. families owns essentially no wealth on net, because debts cancel out whatever small assets they may have, on average.""
Our rating
Sanders says: ""The three wealthiest people"" own ""more wealth than the bottom half of the American people.""
The wealth of Gates, Bezos and Buffett exceeded that of the 160 million at the bottom of the scale, according to a 2017 study. And more recent estimates indicate the wealth of the three has since grown dramatically, widening the gap even more.
We rate Sanders’ statement True."

","WASHINGTON ― Consider the Bernie Bro (Wellus actuallius), an aggressive subgenus of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ supporters. In the year since Sanders lost the Democratic primary, members of this species have been pushed out of their native habitat and forced to migrate to new ecosystems. Some nested down in social media, encroaching on classmates’ Facebook posts and female journalists’ Twitter updates with condescending diatribes about Slavoj Žižek. Others made their way to the hostile environs of Donald Trump’s campaign, finding sustenance in the idea that there was no difference between the Republican and Democratic nominees for president. Still more found their way to your dinner table, nourishing themselves on ponderous expositions of neoliberalism, where and how they refill their beer growlers, and why Bernie would’ve won. Herds of other Bernie Bros, however, have staked out a far more hospitable environment: the Democratic Socialists of America, or DSA. For the uninitiated, DSA ― the inheritor of the American Socialist Party, co-founded by Eugene Debs and instrumental in the progressive reforms of the early 20th century ― is a chapter-based national political advocacy organization that crusades for policies such as a higher minimum wage, safer working conditions and universal health care.
DSA openly uses the big, bad, scary s-word that countless Republican consultants have used to smear Democrats over the years. And despite decades of efforts to stigmatize it, socialism is kind of in right now. This was partly fueled by Sanders’ underdog presidential campaign ― he identifies as a democratic socialist but caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate ― as well as by an economic recovery that has left many working people in the dust, experiencing a growing sense of disillusionment with the Democratic Party. “We were highly visible in the Sanders campaign,” Joseph Schwartz, a DSA national vice chair and professor of political science at Temple University in Philadelphia, told HuffPost. Schwartz said DSA’s growth began to accelerate as the Sanders campaign picked up steam in mid-2015, and has continued since Trump took office. DSA has rooted itself in the millennial psyche with astonishing speed. A quiz posted on Reductress earlier this month was titled, “Is He Into You, Just a Friend, or Trying to Get You to Join the Democratic Socialists?” Comedian Rob Delaney regularly promotes the group on social media. And that rose emoji you keep see popping up on Twitter? It’s likely a reference to both DSA’s logo and that of Socialist International, the global consortium of socialist organizations. Along with #resist and #NeverthelessShePersisted, the rose emoji has remained one of the more enduring social media trends since last November. “The real massive influx was starting with the day Trump was elected,” Schwartz recalled. “Many people want to fight back against Trump, but they also realize that the centrist, pro-corporatist views of the Democratic Party are partially what gave rise to him.”
Universal History Archive via Getty Images Socialist group at the White House, May 15, 1920.
DSA officials say their member rolls shot up from around 8,500 on Election Day to about 21,000 as of early May, and they’re getting upwards of 10 requests a week to help open new chapters. New members are overwhelmingly young and tech-savvy, thanks in no small part to the groundwork the Sanders campaign laid by bringing millions of young people into politics. This engagement was on full display at a May Day rally in Washington, D.C., earlier this month. Around noon, some 100 or so activists from a variety of progressive organizations gathered in a small park in D.C.’s Mount Pleasant neighborhood. Making small talk near the obligatory drum circle were around 10 members of DSA’s D.C.-area chapter, nearly all of whom had signed up to join DSA on or after Election Day. DSA’s contingent was one of the largest on hand, but was nearly all white and male ― contrasting sharply with the rest of the crowd, which was far more diverse and representative of the neighborhood’s large Salvadoran community. The DSA attendees who spoke with HuffPost said they had joined DSA since November and were first drawn to it through the Sanders campaign. “Ever since Trump won, I think people have been feeling very scared and want to do something, and DSA is a great organization to channel that,” said Nick from Poughkeepsie, New York, who declined to give his last name. “I had an awakening during Sanders campaign. I was monitoring the growth of all these organizations and saw that DSA was gaining all these members and felt like DSA spoke to me.” James Mathias, 25, from northern Virginia, had previously volunteered for Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign and later participated in the Occupy Wall Street movement. After voting for Sanders in the 2016 primary, he voted for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election. While he wasn’t wild about Clinton’s policies, he felt compelled to vote for her out of political necessity, given Virginia’s swing state status. Mathias said political realism drew him to DSA and that he has yet to experience the organizational or political disappointment he did with Occupy and Obama. “Each time, I kind of drifted in and out, because both of those things petered out, either literally or philosophically,” Mathias recalled. “Occupy wasn’t focused on engaging with existing political structures. DSA is focused on building power for political ends. I really see a bias for action and not shying away from political structures.” Indeed, DSA doesn’t fashion itself as a vehicle for high-level political office ― most of its members who have run for office have run in municipal elections― but rather as “America’s largest Socialist organization,” per its website. This isn’t a wishy-washy expression of being (The Socialist International was in our hearts all along!), but an acknowledgement that its foundational work is in lending organizational support to candidates from other parties and organizations whose policies align with its agenda. This includes other liberal advocacy organizations and economically progressive politicians like Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Sanders. DSA didn’t endorse Clinton in the 2016 general election, but its chapters actively organized a “Dump Trump” movement targeted at the Republican nominee. That left open the possibility of voting for Green Party nominee Jill Stein or even Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson, but DSA officials told HuffPost they expected a large number of their supporters would back Clinton. Despite DSA’s often antagonistic attitude toward the Democrats, Democratic officials say they’ll happily accept DSA’s support whenever it’s willing to offer it. “We welcome the help of groups across the country who are fighting to defeat Republicans and elect progressive leaders that stand for the same values that make our party so great,” DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa told HuffPost in an email.

While a membership of 21,000 is still small as political entities go ― progressive advocacy group MoveOn.org touts over 7 million members, for example ― DSA members’ engagement has caught the attention of the progressive community. They showed up in large numbers at May Day rallies across the country this year, including a New York City rally that attracted well over 1,000 DSA members. “The people who are joining DSA are people who are extremely active,” said Bob Master, a veteran labor activist and the co-founder and co-chair of the Working Families Party of New York. This gives the group tremendous leverage, Master said: Having a young, energized and tech-fluent base of volunteers is a welcome addition to any political coalition. DSA’s willingness to adapt to the current political framework and engage with other organizations has drawn plaudits from other progressive activist and organizations. “DSA has been an excellent ally, joining with our members in canvassing area businesses; they hosted a fundraiser party that raised $1,000 and helped us expand our operations,” said Hannah Kane, an organizer at Many Languages One Voice, a Washington, D.C., immigrant community group that led the May Day protest. “They’ve just been all-around excellent partners.” George Goehl, the co-director of People’s Action & People’s Action Institute, a Chicago-based advocacy organization, partly attributes DSA’s rise to “the Democratic Party and its constant tacking toward the middle and feeling like the answers to its problems lay in a more moderate, less-structural set of reforms.” “We failed in the last election because we had a candidate who was unable to tap into the anger that people are feeling,” echoed Master. “The Democratic Party cannot limit itself to saying ‘Trump is a bad guy because he fired James Comey.’ [It] has to speak to the growing sense of economic stagnation and diminishment.” Naturally, Democratic officials disagree with this assessment. Hinojosa, the DNC spokeswoman, said the party and its new chairman, Tom Perez, possess “an unwavering commitment to workers and will continue to fight for working families on behalf of the Democratic Party.”
